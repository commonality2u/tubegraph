An explanation has been published by three scientists in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* detailing how [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | microwaving grapes can create plasma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This research utilized high-speed cameras, thermal cameras, and [[role_of_electric_and_magnetic_fields_in_energy_transfer | electromagnetic]] modeling to develop a satisfying explanation that extends beyond just grape plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Interestingly, the same effect can be achieved using [[comparison_of_microwave_interaction_with_grapes_and_hydrogel_beads | hydrogel water beads]] instead of grapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Microwave Interaction with Grapes

A typical household microwave oven operates at a frequency of about 2.45 gigahertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This frequency corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 12 centimeters in air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While interesting phenomena with [[role_of_electric_and_magnetic_fields_in_energy_transfer | electromagnetic radiation]] often occur when an object is similar in size to the wavelength, a grape is much smaller than 12 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### The Role of Refractive Index

The key factor is the wavelength *inside* the object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Although the refractive index of grape material is around 1.33 for visible [[interference_of_light | light]], in the microwave regime, its refractive index is approximately 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This means microwaves travel about ten times slower through the grape than through air, resulting in a wavelength that is a tenth of its size in air, or about 1.2 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This adjusted wavelength is roughly the size of a grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Microwave Trapping and Resonant Modes

When a single grape is placed in a microwave, the microwaves become trapped inside it due to its high refractive index and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This trapping occurs when the diameter of the ball is roughly the same as the microwave wavelength in the material, causing the microwaves to bounce at the borders and remain inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This phenomenon is analogous to total internal reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Inside the grape, the trapped microwaves form resonant modes, or standing waves, where the [[role_of_electric_and_magnetic_fields_in_energy_transfer | electromagnetic fields]] oscillate in a way that maximizes the field strength at the center of the grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Consequently, the grape heats up from the inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Interacting Grapes and Plasma Formation

When two grapes are placed close together, particularly touching, the [[role_of_electric_and_magnetic_fields_in_energy_transfer | electromagnetic fields]] from one grape interact with the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The greatest [[role_of_electric_and_magnetic_fields_in_energy_transfer | electromagnetic field]] concentration occurs at the contact point between the two grapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This concentrated field leads to the highest temperature at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It's important to note that cutting the grapes in half is not necessary; two whole grapes placed side-by-side will also produce the effect as long as they maintain contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

At the intersection of the two grapes, the very strong [[electric_fields_and_surface_charges_in_circuits | electric fields]] cause the air to ionize, creating sparks and leading to plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. These ions then absorb more energy from the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The plasma pulses at 120 Hertz, which is twice the 60 Hertz frequency of mains power, reflecting the pulsing amplitude of the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Analysis of the plasma spectrum revealed strong potassium and sodium emission lines, indicating these ions are common in grapes and are sprayed into the air when plasma forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Grape Size and Absorption

The size of the grapes is important, but they don't need to be an exact size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This is because water, a primary component of grapes, absorbs microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If the material did not absorb microwaves, extreme amplification of the [[role_of_electric_and_magnetic_fields_in_energy_transfer | electromagnetic fields]] would only occur at very specific sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, the absorbent nature of water broadens these peaks, meaning less field amplification but over a wider range of sizes, allowing various grape sizes to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Potential Applications

Beyond being a fun trick, this research has potential applications in microchip fabrication, specifically in lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The phenomenon demonstrates that two spheres of the correct size and refractive index can focus [[role_of_electric_and_magnetic_fields_in_energy_transfer | electromagnetic energy]] into a tiny spot between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. In this case, 12-centimeter microwaves were focused down to about a millimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If similar focusing precision could be achieved with [[interference_of_light | light]], it could significantly improve current lithography techniques, potentially allowing for features as small as 2 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This advancement could help continue Moore's Law by enabling the placement of even more small components onto a single chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

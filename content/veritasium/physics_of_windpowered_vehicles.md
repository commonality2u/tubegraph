The "Blackbird" car is a unique vehicle designed to travel directly downwind faster than the wind itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This counterintuitive claim led to a $10,000 bet between the video creator and Professor Alex Kusenko, a [[Physics of flywheels | physics]] professor at UCLA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The bet was publicly witnessed by prominent science communicators including Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, and Sean Carroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Arguments Against Faster-Than-Wind Travel

Professor Kusenko initially argued against the Blackbird's sustained faster-than-wind operation, proposing several explanations for observed speeds:

### Gusty Wind and Inertia
Professor Kusenko suggested that the vehicle might achieve high speeds due to a strong gust of wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. When the wind speed subsequently drops, the car continues to move by inertia, momentarily going faster than the wind, but it would be in a state of deceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. His analysis indicated that whenever the vehicle's velocity exceeds the wind speed, its acceleration would be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Wind Gradient
Another point raised was the effect of wind gradient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Wind speeds vary with height; wind travels slower closer to the ground and faster at higher altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. While the wind at the "tell-tale" (wind indicator) was measured at about 1 to 1.5 meters, the Blackbird's propeller extends up to three meters above the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Kusenko estimated that the wind speed at the propeller's height could be 10% to 15% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This could make the car *appear* to move faster than the wind measured at the lower height, while actually moving slower than the wind at the propeller's height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Record-Setting Conditions
Regarding the Blackbird's reported record speed of 2.8 times wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, Kusenko suggested this could be achieved through repeated attempts in gusty conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. A strong gust, three times the speed of the air that follows it, could allow for a brief record-setting moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Treadmill Test Validity
Treadmill tests were conducted in still air, simulating a steady tailwind by moving the ground backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. If the car could move forward on a treadmill operating at a certain speed, it would demonstrate acceleration faster than that simulated wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. However, Kusenko questioned these experiments, suggesting potential unconscious bias from human operators who might inadvertently steer the craft or introduce slight downward slopes, leading to the desired result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Theoretical Analysis and the "Divide by Zero" Problem
Professor Kusenko also examined a theoretical analysis by MIT Aero Professor Mark Drela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. His main concern was an equation for net force that included the difference between the car's speed and the wind's speed in the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This implies infinite force when the car's speed exactly matches the wind speed, a mathematical anomaly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Kusenko's own analysis found no such "divide by zero" issues and concluded that the car could not accelerate at or above wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. He asserted that while moving faster than the wind might be possible momentarily, maintaining constant speed with zero acceleration at or above wind speed was not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Evidence Supporting Faster-Than-Wind Travel

### Comprehensive Wind Measurement
To address the wind gradient argument, the Blackbird team mounted tell-tales (wind indicators) on fishing poles out to the sides and even above the propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. All tell-tales, even the highest ones, eventually flipped backward, indicating that every part of the vehicle was indeed traveling faster than the local wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Sustained Acceleration
To counter the gust theory, analysis of video footage using the rotation of the back wheel confirmed that the car continued to accelerate even after the tell-tale flipped backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Furthermore, the tell-tale consistently pointed straight back for over 30 seconds until the brakes were applied, which would not happen if gusts or gradients were the sole reason for the perceived speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
When Blackbird achieved its record speed of 27.7 miles per hour in a 10 mile per hour tailwind, it was still accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This was verified with multiple GPS units and wind speed measurements taken at the height of the propeller in various locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Academic Recognition
The U.S. [[Applying physics in educational demonstrations | Physics]] Olympiad Semifinal Exam in 2013 included questions about the Blackbird, asking if it could go faster than the wind both downwind and upwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The official solution stated that both modes are possible, and with sufficiently low energy loss, "any speed is possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## How the Blackbird Works

The Blackbird does not operate like a traditional windmill, where the wind pushes the propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Instead, its propeller is geared to the wheels via a bike chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. As the wheels turn from contact with the ground, they power the propeller, causing it to turn in the *opposite* direction of the tailwind, effectively working like a fan pushing air backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This action generates forward thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The key to its operation lies in the difference in velocities:
*   The wheels move much faster relative to the ground.
*   The propeller moves relatively slower through the air due to the tailwind.

This allows the thrust force from the propeller to be greater than the backward force applied to the wheels. This concept is analogous to a lever or a pulley, where a smaller force applied over a larger distance (at the wheels) can result in a larger force applied over a smaller distance (at the propeller) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### [[Weight and torque dynamics | Power]] and Force Analysis (Car's Frame of Reference)
In the frame of reference of the car, power is defined as force multiplied by velocity (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> Power = Force Ã— Velocity).
*   **Power In (at wheels):** The ground applies a force on the wheels, generating power equal to the force of the ground on the wheels multiplied by the car's velocity relative to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Power Out (at propeller):** The propeller pushes air backward, doing work on the air. The power out is the force of the prop on the air multiplied by the prop's speed relative to the air (car speed minus wind speed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

Assuming no energy losses, the power in equals the power out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
`Force_ground_on_wheels * V_car = Force_prop_on_air * (V_car - V_wind)`

From this equation, it is evident that the force at the propeller can be greater than the force at the wheels, as `(V_car - V_wind)` is smaller than `V_car` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Since the air applies an equal and opposite forward force on the propeller, this thrust force can be greater than the backward drag on the wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Resolution of the "Divide by Zero" Problem
The "divide by zero" problem arises when `(V_car - V_wind)` approaches zero, suggesting infinite force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This is analogous to a lever where if one arm's displacement is zero, infinite weight can theoretically be lifted with any force on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
In practice, the issue is resolved by incorporating a propeller efficiency term that is well-defined even at zero air speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This eliminates the mathematical singularity and provides a more accurate representation of the [[Impact of fluid flow on aerodynamics and efficiency | aerodynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Demonstrations and Historical Context
The principle of a vehicle moving faster than its driving medium can be demonstrated with a simple cart with a large wheel rolling on two smaller spools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. When the board beneath it is pushed, the cart moves down the board faster than the board itself, with the big wheel rotating in the opposite direction of the board's push, similar to the Blackbird's propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This illustrates the fundamental [[mechanics_of_wind_and_velocity | mechanics]] at play.

> [!INFO] Historical Context
> The concept of a downwind vehicle going faster than the wind is not new. In 1969, Andrew Bauer built the first successful downwind cart to settle a wager with Aero Engineer Apolo Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This was inspired by a student paper from 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Rick Cavallaro, the builder of Blackbird, developed his design independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The phenomenon has also been studied under names like the "push-me pull-you boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

Replicable models of the Blackbird have been successfully built, demonstrating the principle, such as Xyla Foxlin's 3D-printable design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Bet
Following the presentation of additional evidence and explanations, Professor Kusenko conceded the bet and transferred $10,000 to the video creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This outcome underscores the value of scientific [[Debate on faster than wind travel | debate]] and the pursuit of truth through evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. The money was subsequently invested in science communication through a video competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

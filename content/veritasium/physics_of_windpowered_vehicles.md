This article explores the [[physics_of_windpowered_vehicles | physics of wind-powered vehicles]], focusing on a specific craft known as Blackbird, which was designed to settle a long-standing [[downwind_faster_than_the_wind_debate | physics debate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The core of this debate revolves around the counterintuitive claim that a wind-powered vehicle can travel directly downwind faster than the wind itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, a concept that initially seems to violate the law of conservation of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Downwind Faster Than the Wind Debate

The central brain teaser asks: Can any wind-powered vehicle go directly downwind faster than the wind itself? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

### Sailboats as a Comparison
When a sailboat travels straight downwind, it is pushed by the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. However, once the sailboat reaches the same speed as the wind, there is no longer any relative wind pushing the sail, effectively stopping its acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. From the boat's frame of reference, there's no apparent wind, as the air and boat are moving together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Therefore, a sailboat sailing directly downwind can only match the wind's speed, never exceed it, even without drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

However, sailboats *can* exceed wind speed if they travel at an angle to the wind, a process called tacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. In this scenario, the sail acts like an airfoil, generating lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. A component of this lift force propels the boat forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Some sailboats can achieve speeds three or four times the wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. It's also possible for a sailboat tacking downwind to achieve a "velocity made good" (VMG) directly downwind that is faster than the wind itself, meaning it can beat a freely drifting balloon to a destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

This concept led to the idea that if the Earth were a cylinder, a sailboat could continuously tack downwind, spiraling along, and effectively behave like a propeller moving faster than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## The Blackbird Vehicle

Blackbird is a one-of-a-kind propeller craft, invented by Rick and currently owned by Neil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Its design directly addresses the [[downwind_faster_than_the_wind_hypothesis | hypothesis]] that a vehicle can go straight downwind faster than the air pushing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### How Blackbird Works
Blackbird's operation is counterintuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It doesn't function like a windmill, where the wind blows on the propeller to drive the wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Instead, it works as follows:
1.  **Initial Movement**: The wind pushes the vehicle from behind, causing it to roll forward slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
2.  **Propeller Drive**: The wheels are geared to the propeller in such a way that they turn the propeller *opposite* to the direction the wind is pushing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
3.  **Fan Operation**: Rather than operating as a windmill, the propeller spins like a fan, pushing air backwards relative to the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
4.  **Thrust Generation**: This backward push of air generates thrust, driving the craft forwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### The Science Behind It (Physics Explanation)
The key to understanding Blackbird's operation lies in distinguishing between the vehicle's speed relative to the ground and its speed relative to the air (the wind).

Even when Blackbird is moving at the speed of the wind, there is no relative air motion *over the cart* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. However, the propeller, acting as a fan, can still "hit" air molecules and push them backwards, generating thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This doesn't mean energy is created from nowhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

The energy comes from the wind itself. When the propeller pushes air backward relative to the vehicle, it actually slows down the tailwind behind the propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. For example, if the surrounding wind is 10 km/h, the propeller might slow the wind directly behind it to 8 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. The energy extracted from this reduction in the wind's kinetic energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the vehicle, accelerating it forward faster than the original wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

Even when the vehicle is moving forward faster than the wind speed, the propeller can continue to push the air backwards, slowing the tailwind and converting some of that wind's energy into the vehicle's kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

## The Public Debate and Skepticism

When Rick first proposed the idea, he posted it on online forums, expecting initial disbelief followed by acceptance once the explanation was provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. However, he was "incredibly wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Many people, including some who claimed expertise, strongly denied the possibility:

> "This is, obviously, stupid. Wind isn't some kind of magic." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>
> "We all want to believe in perpetual motion, but I just don't see the logic of this argument as yet." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>
> "This is clearly fake. Anyone with a clue should see the problem here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
> "Once you reach wind speed, what powers it past that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>

To counter this, a small model was built and tested on a treadmill, which successfully demonstrated the principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. However, even this wasn't enough to convince skeptics, with some physics professors arguing the treadmill wasn't a good real-world analog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Others claimed magnets, wires, or hidden fans were at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This persistent skepticism led to the decision to build the full-scale Blackbird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Driving Blackbird: The Proof

The test site for Blackbird was El Mirage, a dry lakebed a couple of hours from Los Angeles, chosen for its long, straight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. To prove its capability, a "telltale" string on the front of the vehicle and a windsock were used:
*   **Telltale**: Shows the apparent wind direction relative to the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Windsock**: Shows the true wind direction from the ground reference frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

Initially, when moving at wind speed, the telltale would dangle straight down, indicating no apparent wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. If Blackbird could go faster than the wind, the telltale would flip around and point *straight at the driver*, indicating an apparent headwind, even though the true wind was coming from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Despite several challenges, including mechanical issues (a broken chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>) and concerns about vehicle stability in high winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, Blackbird successfully achieved the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. The telltale pointed straight back at the driver, confirming an apparent headwind, while the windsock confirmed the true wind was from behind, proving the vehicle was going faster than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

The Blackbird team holds a record, achieving 2.8 times the wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. The demonstrations and direct experience confirm that driving a vehicle downwind faster than the wind is physically possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

The widespread adoption of LED lighting marks a significant revolution in illumination, promising substantial energy savings and environmental benefits as the [[transition_from_incandescent_to_led_lighting_technology | transition from incandescent to LED lighting technology]] continues globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. However, innovation in LED technology is ongoing, with researchers like [[shji_nakamuras_contributions_to_led_technology | ShÅ«ji Nakamura]] actively developing the next generation of these efficient light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

## Next-Generation LED Types

Current research focuses on two main areas: Micro LEDs and UV LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. These advancements aim to expand the [[impact_of_led_technology_on_modern_lighting | impact of LED technology on modern lighting]] beyond general illumination.

### Micro LEDs
Micro LEDs represent a significant reduction in size from standard LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. While a standard LED might measure 300 by 200 microns, micro LEDs can be as small as five microns, making them incredibly tiny, even smaller than a human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This minuscule size makes them ideal for near-eye displays in technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

### UV LEDs
UV LEDs harness ultraviolet light for various applications beyond visible illumination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

#### Applications
UV LEDs have strong potential for sterilizing surfaces in environments such as hospitals and kitchens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. The ability to simply turn on UV lights to kill pathogens in seconds could be transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a surge in interest and stock prices for UV LED companies, driven by the expectation that these devices could sterilize the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

#### Materials and Challenges
While visible light LEDs typically use indium gallium nitride, UV LEDs require aluminum gallium nitride due to its larger band gap, which is necessary to emit higher-energy UV photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

Despite their potential, UV LEDs currently face significant challenges regarding cost and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. Their efficiency is presently less than 10%, contributing to very high production costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. However, experts anticipate that efficiency will eventually surpass 50%, making their cost comparable to that of mercury lamps, and thus commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

## Conclusion

The ongoing research into micro LEDs and UV LEDs demonstrates the continuous evolution of this technology, promising further advancements in display, sterilization, and beyond.

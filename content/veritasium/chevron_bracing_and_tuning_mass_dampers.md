The Citicorp Center, opened in 1977, was an engineering marvel that became the 11th tallest building in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Described as an "acrobatic act of architecture" by the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>, it was later given an honor award by the American Institute of Architects, who called it a "tour de force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. However, less than a year after its opening in the summer of 1978, its structural engineer, Bill LeMessurier, made a terrifying discovery: the building had a fatal flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Winds of just 110 kilometers per hour could cause it to collapse, potentially killing thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Unique Design Requirements

In the 1960s, Citicorp aimed to build a new headquarters in Manhattan on a block that included Saint Peter's church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The pastor insisted that any new building must involve the church as an independent part, with two-thirds of the space above the church remaining free and clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

To accommodate this, architect Hugh Stubbins and structural engineer Bill LeMessurier designed the tower to be built around the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. LeMessurier suggested notching out all four corners of the tower, essentially constructing the skyscraper on stilts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This was unique, as an engineer proposed making the job harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. The stilts served two main purposes: supporting at least half of the building's gravity load, with the rest held by a central column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, and withstanding high wind loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Unlike ordinary structures, these stilts were positioned at the center of each face, rather than the corners, creating an engineering challenge regarding stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Chevron Bracing System

LeMessurier's solution to the unique column placement was a system of diagonal braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. He sketched six layers of diagonal braces, forming chevrons, up each face of the tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. These chevrons would transfer forces to the middle of each face and down to the stilts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

To achieve this, columns at the top and middle of each chevron were removed, making each tier act as a separate unit connected only to the braces and central core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Every eight stories, half of the gravity load would be forced through the chevrons to the mid-face columns and down to the stilts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. This particular system was entirely unique, driven by the column placement and building conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

For wind loads, diagonal bracing is crucial because beams and columns are stronger in compression or tension than with bending loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. With chevrons, the wind load compresses one diagonal and stretches another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. The wind load then builds up as it goes down the building due to shear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Citicorp's design meant the entire triangular section formed by the chevrons would rotate, with one chevron pulling down in tension and the far chevron pushing up in compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. The wind load wraps around the entire building, and each chevron transfers the load to the section below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

The chevron braces were massive, nearly 40 meters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Due to their size and the challenges of transport, they were sent in pieces and welded together on site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

## Tuned Mass Damper (TMD)

While the chevron bracing solved the wind and gravity load issues, it created a new problem: the building was lighter and more swayable than most other buildings in New York, making it potentially uncomfortable for occupants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

LeMessurier's elegant solution was a tuned mass damper (TMD), a system previously used in bridges, power lines, and ships, but never before in a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. A TMD works by transferring some of the building's kinetic energy to a secondary mass (like a pendulum or a large mass on springs) that starts to oscillate out of phase with the building's motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Energy is then dissipated through friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

The system must be carefully tuned, matching the building's frequency and having the right amount of friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. The mass needs to be 1 to 5% of the building's weight to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

In Citicorp, LeMessurier used a 400-ton concrete mass, 29 feet square and 8 feet thick, installed on the top floor and affectionately known as "that great block of cheese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. As Citicorp sways, the block moves in the same direction, with energy dissipated through separate viscous dampers, causing the building's oscillations to be damped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. LeMessurier expected the damper to reduce swaying amplitude by about 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. This innovative approach also saved approximately $4 million by avoiding an additional 2,800 tons of structural steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

## The Flaw Discovered

In May 1978, LeMessurier learned that the chevron connections were bolted instead of welded, a substitution his firm had approved to save money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. While bolts aren't inherently worse than welds, it was surprising given the building's cutting-edge design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. LeMessurier initially believed the substitution was fine, as the gravity load always compressed the braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

A month later, a student's inquiry prompted LeMessurier to re-examine the building's response to wind loads from all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. He realized that the worst loading case was not perpendicular wind, but rather [[wind_analysis_and_quartering_winds | quartering winds]] hitting a corner of the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. This resulted in forces 40% higher than his initial calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.

This increase in forces became critical because the original design assumed welded connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. His team had calculated the number of bolts based on straight-on wind, not [[wind_analysis_and_quartering_winds | quartering winds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. For example, a brace halfway down the tower, under perpendicular wind, required four bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>. However, with quartering winds, the tension in the brace more than doubled, requiring about 10 bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. Furthermore, LeMessurier's firm considered the braces minor elements and didn't apply the correct factor of safety, meaning they should have used 14 bolts, but only four were installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

After further analysis with Alan Davenport at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel, it was found that stresses could increase by up to 60% when considering dynamic conditions (the building moving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. LeMessurier determined the weakest joints were on the 30th floor, and their failure would cause the entire building to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.

Under static conditions, a storm strong enough to tear the building apart occurred every 67 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. However, if a storm knocked out power to the tuned mass damper, even 110 km/h winds blowing for five minutes could collapse the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>. The chance of such a storm happening in any given year was one in 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. Hurricane Belle, with 110 km/h gusts, had passed through New York City just a year before Citicorp's completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

## Project Serene: The Repair and Aftermath

Facing potential lawsuits and professional ruin, LeMessurier chose to act, understanding the responsibility to prevent a social risk that could kill thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. He informed Citicorp's chairman, Walter Wriston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>.

Immediately, emergency generators were acquired for the tuned mass damper, which became the tower's crucial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>. The confidential repair plan was dubbed "Project Serene" (Special Engineering Review of Events Nobody Envisioned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>. Each night, welders entered the building to remove sheetrock, weld two 5-centimeter thick, 2-meter long steel plates onto each joint, and then replace the wall before morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. They needed to weld over 200 joints, prioritizing those on the 30th floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.

As hurricane season approached before repairs were complete, Citicorp and the Red Cross developed a 10-block evacuation plan, as a collapse could topple into other buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>. To avoid mass panic, the public and even building occupants were not informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>. Strain gauges were installed on structural members, monitored from a comm center eight blocks away, with emergency telephone lines quickly installed by AT&T's president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.

A press blackout due to a New York Times strike in August 1978 proved fortuitous, keeping the repairs a secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:00">[25:18:00]</a>. However, late August brought Hurricane Ella, with winds reaching 200 km/h, threatening New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>. For 24 tense hours, Ella stalled before veering off into the sea, sparing New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.

The repairs were completed in October, just six weeks after LeMessurier informed Citicorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>. The building can now withstand a "one in 1000 storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>. The repairs cost $4-5 million, but LeMessurier argued Citicorp was willing to spend more on the original design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>.

The secret was kept for almost two decades until "The New Yorker" revealed Project Serene in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>. LeMessurier was praised for his ethical conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:00">[27:35:00]</a>. Subsequently, New York updated its building code to require [[wind_analysis_and_quartering_winds | quartering wind]] calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>.

## Legacy of Tuned Mass Dampers

Since Citicorp's first TMD, these devices have become ubiquitous globally, allowing for taller and slimmer skyscrapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>. Citicorp Center was the first tall building in the world to use mechanical help to make the structure work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>. Six of the 20 tallest buildings in the world now include TMDs, especially critical in typhoon or earthquake-prone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>. For example, Taipei 101 uses a massive 660-ton pendulum that stabilizes the building against winds up to 200 km/h and earthquakes over magnitude 6.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>.

## Controversy and Ethics

The identity of the student who prompted LeMessurier's re-evaluation remained controversial for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a>. Diane Hartley, a Princeton undergraduate, studied the Citicorp Tower for her senior thesis in 1978 and questioned the absence of [[wind_analysis_and_quartering_winds | quartering wind]] considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>. An engineer from LeMessurier's firm assured her it was not a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>. In 2011, Lee DeCarolis came forward, claiming to be the student from the New Jersey Institute of Technology who had the phone conversation with LeMessurier that prompted the re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>. Sadly, LeMessurier passed away in 2007 and could not confirm the student's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>.

Despite the controversy and the initial reluctance of those involved to discuss the incident, LeMessurier's actions are widely regarded as a case study in good engineering ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:19:00">[32:19:00]</a>. Engineers are taught that they have a responsibility beyond themselves, especially when a social risk, like a structural flaw that could kill thousands, is identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>.

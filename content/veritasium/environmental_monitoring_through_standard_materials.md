The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) operates a U.S. government warehouse that sells a wide array of items, including those used for [[use_of_standard_reference_materials_in_various_industries | environmental monitoring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These items, known as Standard Reference Materials (SRMs), are meticulously characterized to quantify something important about the world that is often difficult to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. A significant purpose of these SRMs is to identify dangerous contaminants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## Types of Environmental Standard Reference Materials

### Domestic Sludge
Domestic sludge is a standard reference material available for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It consists of solid material removed from wastewater treatment plants, which is then dried into a fine powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This sludge serves as a record of what has been flushed down sewers and exited human bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Researchers utilize it to examine for traces of toxins or heavy metals, providing insight into contaminants many individuals may be unknowingly exposed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

### House Dust
House dust is another SRM used for [[global_contamination_and_persistence_of_forever_chemicals | environmental monitoring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. In the early 1990s, NIST collaborated with maid services to collect vacuum bags from hotels and homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The collected dust was thoroughly mixed to ensure consistency across all samples, and every component within it was measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. From an environmental perspective, dust is an effective indicator of the chemicals individuals and their homes are exposed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Other Contaminated Materials
NIST also offers other SRMs for environmental analysis:
*   **Lead Paint:** Several types of lead paint are available as SRMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Glacier Water:** Water sourced from a glacier in Greenland is so rare that its distribution is limited to one unit per customer every three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **Contaminated Soil:** Soil samples from New Jersey and Montana, including those collected from contaminated industrial sites in Bozeman, Montana, are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. These soil SRMs are certified for their toxic element content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

## Future Developments: Human Poop Product
In the near future, NIST plans to release a human poop product as a standard reference material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This development is driven by the increasing understanding of the link between health and the human microbiome, particularly gut flora, which is crucial for overall health and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Fecal matter is an extremely challenging matrix to measure and extract components from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This new SRM will support measurements of metabolites and will be distributed as a vial of powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

As knowledge of the world evolves, so do the [[importance_and_cost_of_standard_reference_materials | standard reference materials]] available, ensuring consistent and accurate environmental monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

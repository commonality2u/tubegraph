## Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

In classical mechanics, if the state of a system (like a particle's position and velocity) is known, Newton's second law can predict its future behavior [00:00:05]. [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | Quantum mechanics]] operates similarly: if the quantum state of a particle, defined by its [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]], is known, the Schrodinger equation can be used to calculate its future actions [00:00:16]. Typically, a particle's [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] spreads out over time [00:00:26].

A key symmetry exists where knowing the initial state allows for its smooth and continuous evolution into the future using an equation [00:00:36].

## The Measurement Problem

A fundamental challenge in [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] is that the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] is never directly observed in its spread-out form [00:00:46]. Instead, when a measurement is made, the particle is found at a single point in space [00:00:50]. This raises the question of how to reconcile the smoothly evolving, spread-out [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] with the point-like detection of a particle [00:00:56].

Early quantum theorists tended to consider the measurement more real than the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]], as measurements were observable and matched the experience of a world composed of matter particles [00:01:07]. The nature of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] itself was harder to define [00:01:24].

### Max Born and the Probability Interpretation

Erwin Schrodinger formulated his [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave equation]] because scientists, such as de Broglie, suspected that matter possessed wave-like properties [00:01:26]. It was Max Born who proposed how to interpret the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]]:
*   At each point in space, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] has a complex amplitude (a real number plus an imaginary number) [00:01:39].
*   Born suggested that squaring this amplitude yields the probability of finding the particle at that point [00:01:48].
*   This idea, appearing as a last-minute footnote in Born's paper, introduced probability into the core understanding of reality [00:01:57].

This probabilistic view meant the universe was no longer purely deterministic, a concept that made many scientists, including Einstein, uncomfortable [00:02:07]. However, the "Born rule" remains central to [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] due to its success in predicting experimental outcomes [00:02:17].

### Wave Function Collapse

The traditional understanding of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] involves two sets of rules [00:02:26]:
1.  When not observed, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] evolves according to the Schrodinger equation [00:02:32].
2.  When a measurement is made, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapses suddenly and irreversibly, with the probability of any outcome given by the squared amplitude of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] associated with that outcome [00:02:35].

## Schrodinger's Cat Thought Experiment

Schrodinger himself disliked the concept of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapse, which led him to devise the famous Schrodinger's Cat thought experiment [00:02:51].
*   **Setup**: A cat is placed in a box with a radioactive atom, a radiation detector, and a vial of poisonous cyanide gas [00:02:57]. The detector triggers the release of the gas if the atom decays [00:03:02].
*   **Purpose**: The experiment was designed to magnify the quantum state of an atom to a macroscopic, tangible level [00:03:16].
*   **Outcomes**:
    *   If the atom decays, the detector detects radiation, releases poison, and the cat dies [00:03:29].
    *   If the atom doesn't decay, no poison is released, and the cat lives [00:03:35].

### Superposition and Entanglement in the Experiment

According to [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]], the atom can exist in a [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | superposition]] of both decayed and not-decayed states simultaneously, assuming no measurements are made [00:03:51]. This [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | superposition]] state of the atom becomes [[entanglement | entangled]] with the detector and subsequently with the cat [00:04:04]. As a result, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of everything inside the box enters a [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | superposition]] where the atom has not decayed (cat alive) and the atom has decayed (cat dead) [00:04:12].

The traditional interpretation suggests the cat is "both alive and dead at the same time" until the box is opened and a measurement is made, causing the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] to collapse into a definite state (either dead or alive) [00:04:26]. Schrodinger's intent was to highlight the perceived absurdity of this collapse mechanism [00:04:46].

## Core Quantum Concepts: Superposition and Entanglement

To find a more logical and consistent way of thinking about [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]], it's essential to examine its core components: [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | superposition]], [[entanglement | entanglement]], and measurement [00:05:07].

### Superposition

[[Quantum mechanics and wave function | Superposition]] is the concept that quantum objects can exist in multiple states simultaneously [00:05:15]. While it seems counterintuitive, it is indirectly observed through experiments like the double-slit experiment [00:05:22]:
*   When individual electrons are fired through two slits at a screen, they produce an interference pattern, not just the sum of electrons going through each slit separately [00:05:28].
*   This forces the conclusion that a single electron somehow passes through both slits simultaneously [00:05:39].
*   This phenomenon is readily understood when considering electrons as waves, which are spread out in space [00:05:51].
*   The double-slit experiment provides concrete evidence that the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] allows individual electrons to pass through both slits at the same time [00:06:08]. Thus, [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | superposition]] is on solid ground [00:06:18].

### Entanglement

[[entanglement | Entanglement]] describes a situation where two or more particles become linked in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when separated by vast distances [00:07:01].
*   **Example**: Two electrons fired towards each other with equal and opposite velocities will scatter [00:06:22]. Although their trajectories are probabilistic due to their spread-out [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave functions]], as soon as the momentum of one electron is measured, the momentum of the other is instantaneously known (it must be equal and opposite to conserve momentum) [00:06:28].
*   Before measurement, the momentum of each electron was in a [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | superposition]] of states [00:06:51]. Measuring one instantaneously collapses the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of the other, even if they are light-years apart [00:06:58].
*   The underlying reason for [[entanglement | entanglement]] is that after interacting, the electrons are described by a single, shared [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] [00:07:09]. This single [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapsing explains why measuring one immediately affects the state of the other [00:07:22].
*   Rigorously, there is only one [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]]: the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of the entire universe, which includes everything [00:07:28]. Individual [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave functions]] can only be reasonably discussed for isolated, unentangled quantum particles [00:07:38]. Once particles interact, [[entanglement | entanglement]] is the result [00:07:44].

## The Many-Worlds Interpretation

The "measurement postulate" was added to [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] as a second set of rules to link the theory's mathematics to observed reality [00:08:11]. However, it seems strange to have one rule for system evolution when unobserved and another when observed [00:08:21]. Since measurement is simply the interaction of quantum systems (like electrons and photons), which should also obey the Schrodinger equation, what if the measurement rules are discarded [00:08:29]?

### Resolving Schrodinger's Cat without Collapse

In the [[Manyworlds interpretation of quantum mechanics | Many-Worlds Interpretation]] (MWI), if the measurement rules are removed, the Schrodinger's Cat experiment unfolds differently [00:08:44]:
*   The radioactive atom, in its [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | superposition]] of decayed and not-decayed states, becomes [[entanglement | entangled]] with the detector and then the cat [00:08:50].
*   Since observers (like us) are also made of quantum mechanical atoms and electrons, when we open the box, there is no measurement or [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapse [00:09:00].
*   Instead, we become [[entanglement | entangled]] with the state of everything inside the box [00:09:09].
*   The apparent paradox of seeing both an alive and dead cat is resolved because the "you" that saw the cat alive and the "you" that saw it dead inhabit separate worlds [00:09:26]. These realities will never interact [00:09:36].

### Environmental Decoherence and Branching

The separation of worlds in MWI is attributed to the interaction of the quantum object with the environment's particles (like air molecules and photons) [00:09:41].
*   When a quantum object in a [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | superposition]] becomes [[entanglement | entangled]] with its environment, it undergoes "environmental decoherence" [00:09:51].
*   This process "branches" the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of the universe, effectively splitting the universe into slightly different copies [00:09:56].
*   In the case of Schrodinger's cat, the detector becomes [[entanglement | entangled]] with the environment because air molecules and photons would interact differently if the detector senses radiation [00:10:23].
*   Almost immediately, the detector [[entanglement | entangles]] with the environment, leading to decoherence and branching the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] [00:10:33].
*   At that moment, the observer is split into two identical copies, each [[entanglement | entangled]] with a different outcome of the experiment (one seeing an alive cat, the other a dead one) [00:10:43].
*   These observers, though originating from the same person, are no longer identical and inhabit distinct realities [00:11:03].

### Implications and Advantages of Many-Worlds

[[Manyworlds interpretation of quantum mechanics | Many-Worlds Interpretation]], formulated by Hugh Everett [00:11:12], posits that this branching of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] is happening constantly, possibly infinitely often [00:11:16].
*   While creating infinite subtly different worlds may seem implausible, all these worlds are naturally part of the mathematics of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] [00:11:27]. Removing them requires an additional concept like [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapse [00:11:36].
*   The experience of reality is the same in MWI as in the collapse picture, but the MWI formalism is "cleaner and more elegant" [00:11:43].
*   In MWI, only [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave functions]] evolving under the Schrodinger equation exist [00:11:52].
*   This implies that the founders of quantum theory might have been mistaken in their foundational assumption: the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] is the complete picture of reality, and our measurements are only a tiny fraction of it, the part we become [[entanglement | entangled]] with when we interact with a [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | superposition]] [00:11:58].
*   The universe becomes deterministic again, as every outcome happens 100% of the time; it only appears probabilistic to us because we only experience our "tiny sliver of the multiverse" [00:12:15].

## Common Questions and Objections to Many-Worlds

Sean Carroll, a Caltech professor and author of a book on [[Manyworlds interpretation of quantum mechanics | Many-Worlds]], addresses common concerns [00:12:41]:

*   **Energy Conservation**: Energy is 100% conserved for the entire [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] [00:13:03]. The branching subdivides the universe's energy into different pieces, but the total remains constant [00:13:22].
*   **Frequency of Branching**: There is no exact answer, but branching happens frequently [00:13:46]. For example, radioactive decays in the human body occur thousands of times per second, each causing a branching of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] as the decay becomes [[entanglement | entangled]] with its environment [00:14:04]. Whether the total number of branches is infinite or finite is unknown, as it depends on concepts in [[unification_of_physics_theories | quantum gravity]] and cosmology not yet fully understood [00:14:26].
*   **Misconception: "Everything that could possibly happen happens"**: This is not true [00:14:52]. [[Manyworlds interpretation of quantum mechanics | Many-Worlds]] means the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] obeys the Schrodinger equation, which predicts many potential outcomes but not all [00:14:59]. For example, an electron will never convert into a proton because the Schrodinger equation assigns zero probability to events that violate conservation laws [00:15:07].
*   **Instantaneous vs. Spreading Branching**: Descriptions of branching happening instantly across space or spreading at the speed of light make identical predictions [00:17:25]. This is because the concept of "branches" or "worlds" is a human convenience for understanding the complex universal [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]], not a fundamental part of reality itself [00:18:01]. It's analogous to describing the air in a room by temperature and pressure rather than listing every molecule's position and velocity [00:18:21].

In 1929, numerous deaths in Chicago were linked to leaks from refrigerators, which then used toxic methyl chloride or flammable gases as refrigerants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This led one company to seek a safer alternative, inadvertently creating a "magical substance" that would soon become ubiquitous in American homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Unbeknownst to the public, the chemicals used to create these products were being released into the environment, leading to the slow poisoning of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This story involves one of the largest [[legal_and_corporate_coverups_related_to_teflon_production | chemical coverups]] in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The Accidental Discovery of Teflon

In 1936, DuPont tasked 27-year-old chemist Roy J. Plunkett with finding a non-toxic and non-flammable gas for refrigerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While experimenting with tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), he discovered that the gas had polymerized under high pressure into a white, slippery powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This new substance, polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE, was seemingly indestructible, resisting water, acids, bases, and all laboratory solvents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

The extreme durability of PTFE stems from the carbon-fluorine bond, which is the strongest single bond a carbon atom can form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Fluorine's strong electron affinity and small size allow it to pull carbon's electrons close, creating a powerful electrostatic attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This makes compounds containing these bonds highly inert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Initially, DuPont didn't know what to do with this inert material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. However, its properties proved invaluable for the Manhattan Project, where DuPont was refining uranium and plutonium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Uranium hexafluoride gas, a highly corrosive chemical used in the process, rapidly deteriorated plant equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. PTFE was successfully used to create gaskets, seals, and pipe linings that resisted the gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Its effectiveness was so critical that the manager of the nuclear weapons plant stated, "There was never a substitute considered, as far as I know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Recognizing its potential, DuPont trademarked the material as "Teflon" in 1944 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## The Role of C8 in Teflon Production

Producing Teflon proved challenging because the polymerization of TFE releases significant heat, which, if uncontrolled, can cause explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. An explosion at DuPont's Arlington plant in 1944 killed two workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. To dissipate this heat, the reaction needed to occur in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. However, TFE gas does not dissolve in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

In 1951, DuPont bought a special acid called PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid), also known as C8, from 3M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. C8 has a hydrophobic, Teflon-like tail and a hydrophilic, acid head group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. When added to water, C8 molecules form tiny, dry bubbles, dispersing TFE gas evenly throughout the water. This allowed polymerization to occur without dangerous heat build-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. C8 acted as a processing aid, much like soap combines oil and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This method also allowed Teflon to be suspended in a solution and sprayed as a coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## Widespread Adoption and Early Warnings

After the war, DuPont commercialized Teflon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. A French engineer's wife famously suggested coating a pan, leading to the "cooking revolution" of non-stick cookware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Soon, Teflon and similar chemicals were found in numerous products:
*   Stain-resistant carpets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>
*   Waterproof and breathable jackets (Gore-Tex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>
*   Medical implants (due to its inertness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>
*   Coatings for structures like the Statue of Liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>
*   Bullet coatings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>

By the late 1990s, Teflon sales generated roughly a billion dollars annually for DuPont <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Despite Teflon's safety, early concerns about its processing aid, C8, emerged. In 1961, DuPont's own scientists found that C8 caused abnormal liver growth in rats and was lethal at high doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Although less acutely fatal than sodium cyanide, C8 was concerning because its carbon-fluorine bonds made it incredibly stable and persistent in the environment for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Furthermore, C8's structural resemblance to fatty acids meant it could hitch a ride on proteins, potentially disrupting vital systems in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Humans and animals cannot break down C8, leading to its slow accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Subsequent studies in 1962 and 1965 confirmed C8's toxic effects in rats and dogs, causing injury to multiple organs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Monkeys in these studies were also dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. These findings were not shared with the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## The Revelation of Contamination and Legal Battles

The widespread contamination began to surface in 1975 when researchers, studying the presence of inorganic fluorides in human blood due to water fluoridation, unexpectedly found another type of fluorine: organic fluorine (carbon-fluorine bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. This finding was significant because organic fluorine is not naturally occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. When asked, 3M, a producer of organic fluorides like PFOA, initially pled ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. However, just three months later, 3M confirmed that its chemicals matched the organic fluorine found in the blood of Americans, yet they did not disclose this to the researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Both 3M and DuPont found their own workers had C8 levels 1,000 times higher than the general population, with many showing signs of liver disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

Despite this knowledge, DuPont continued to dump approximately 10 tons of C8 into the Ohio River annually and piled thousands more tons as sludge that leached from a landfill near Parkersburg, West Virginia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

In 1998, farmer Earl Tennant sought legal help from lawyer Rob Bilott, suspecting something in a creek near his farm was poisoning his cows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The cows suffered from tumors, black teeth, and hair loss on their hooves due to a white foam discharged from a pipe marked "E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. This pipe drained from DuPont's Washington Works factory, the first commercial Teflon plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

DuPont's presence in Parkersburg was significant, providing jobs and community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. When Tennant pursued legal action, he and his family were shunned by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Bilott discovered that the mysterious chemical wasn't listed on DuPont's disposal permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. After obtaining 60,000 pages of DuPont's operational records, he found repeated mentions of C8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

In the early 1980s, a cancer study in rats confirmed that PFOA "causes testicular tumors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. DuPont's internal tests showed C8 in the Ohio River and the public water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. In 1984, DuPont officials decided against swapping C8 for a safer chemical due to economic unattractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. They then set their own "safe dose" for drinking water at 0.6 parts per billion, rounded up to one part per billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. This level was chosen because it was the lowest detectable amount in water at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. However, the landfill wastewater leaching into Earl's creek tested at 1,600 parts per billion, a fact DuPont concealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

Rob Bilott compiled the evidence and sent it to the EPA and Department of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. DuPont settled with the Tennant family for an undisclosed sum, denying any wrongdoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Bilott then sued DuPont on behalf of 70,000 people around Parkersburg exposed to C8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. By 2000, 100% of blood samples from thousands of Americans tested positive for C8, at an average of five parts per billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

## Health Impacts of PFAS

To determine C8's harm, a medical study of residents around Washington Works was conducted, taking seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. In 2013, an independent science panel confirmed a probable link between C8 and six human diseases:
*   Thyroid disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>
*   Testicular cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>
*   Kidney cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>
*   High cholesterol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>
*   Decreased immune system response to vaccines and infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>
*   Decreased growth in infants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>

For example, a person with more than 30 parts per billion of C8 in their blood serum might have double the odds of developing kidney cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. The true risk may be even higher as studies often exclude those who died from exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

In 2013, pressure led DuPont to phase out C8, and by 2017, they paid over $600 million to victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. DuPont then spun off its Teflon business into Chemours, which began using GenX (C6), a shorter carbon chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Chemours claimed GenX was safer, but later studies showed it caused the exact same three tumors in rats (liver, testicular, pancreatic) as PFOA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. GenX's shorter chain also makes it more mobile, allowing it to contaminate larger areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

GenX and C8 are part of a larger family of over 14,000 man-made chemicals known as PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. These chemicals are often called [[global_contamination_and_persistence_of_forever_chemicals | forever chemicals]] due to their carbon-fluorine bonds, which make them incredibly persistent in the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. They have been found on every continent, including Antarctica, and in almost every living creature, from polar bears to fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

[!WARNING]
Companies were aware of the dangers of these chemicals over 50 years ago but chose not to inform the public or regulators, leading to widespread [[global_contamination_and_persistence_of_forever_chemicals | global contamination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

## Sources of Exposure and Personal Risk

Not all PFAS are equally dangerous. Fluoropolymers like Teflon, which have long, repeating chains of carbon-fluorine bonds, are generally safe because they are too large and inert to be absorbed into the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. However, the processing aids used to make these fluoropolymers, such as PFOA and GenX, are the harmful ones. These smaller molecules (5-10 carbons long) can enter the bloodstream and bind to proteins, slowly accumulating throughout the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

The most comprehensive document on PFAS toxicity, published in 2022 by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, focused on seven perfluoroalkyl acids (sister chemicals to PFOA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. These include PFOS and PFHxS, which were heavily used in stain and water-resistant products like 3M's Scotchgard before being phased out due to toxicity concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

The report's guidance on blood levels:
*   **Below 2 parts per billion:** No anticipated harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>
*   **2 to 20 parts per billion:** Potential for harmful health effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>
*   **Above 20 parts per billion:** Greater risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>

Personal blood tests confirm widespread exposure; a researcher stated they have never seen a non-detectable level of PFAS in blood since 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. The three main ways people are exposed to [[global_contamination_and_persistence_of_forever_chemicals | forever chemicals]] are:

1.  **PFAS-containing products:** While direct exposure through skin from items like non-stick pans, waterproof clothing, or stain-resistant furniture is likely low (as the Teflon coating itself is inert), the larger problem is how easily PFAS from these products can leach into the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. Many factories lack proper containment of these chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
2.  **Food:** A significant source is food packaged in PFAS-treated materials, such as takeout boxes, microwave popcorn bags, and burger wrappers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. Studies show that eating fast food and especially microwave popcorn can increase PFAS load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. Reheating food on a plate instead of in its original packaging can help reduce migration of PFAS to food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.
3.  **Water:** This is often the biggest source of exposure, especially near PFAS factories, military bases, or airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Firefighting foams, which use PFAS to lower surface tension and enhance foam action, are frequently used in drills at these sites, leading to seepage into soil and groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. The entire water cycle is contaminated, with unsafe levels of at least four PFAS species found even in rain on the Tibetan Plateau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

[!TIP]
To check local water levels, online maps show PFAS contamination across the US, Europe, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. For specific information, contact your water provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

## Mitigation and Future Outlook

The US EPA finally set legal limits for PFAS in drinking water in April 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. The safe level for PFOA and PFOS was set at four parts per trillion, a significant reduction from DuPont's initial one part per billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. This means the EPA is concerned if there's even one drop of PFOA in 5,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. For reference, the EPA's limit for [[impact_of_tetraethyl_lead_on_global_health | lead]] in water is 10,000 parts per trillion, and for cyanide, 200,000 parts per trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

[[efforts_to_mitigate_pfas_exposure_and_regulatory_challenges | If your water is contaminated]], consider getting a PFAS-certified filter (reverse osmosis, granulated active carbon, or ion exchange) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. However, the responsibility should not fall solely on individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. PFAS should be captured at the source during manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. Companies like Puraffinity are developing custom filters to remove PFAS from industrial wastewater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

For personal health, while PFAS exposure is a concern, it typically falls lower on the "hierarchy of risk reduction" compared to lifestyle factors like smoking cessation, exercise, healthy diet, and sufficient sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. There are currently no approved medical treatments for PFAS removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.

**Specific Considerations:**
*   **Sex differences:** Male PFAS levels are consistently higher until around age 50 (menopause), partly because menstruation, birth, and lactation allow PFAS to escape the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>.
*   **Vulnerable populations:** Pregnant individuals and young children should be extremely careful due to increased susceptibility and exposure (e.g., through breast milk or treated carpets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.
*   **Occupational exposure:** Firefighters have exceptionally high PFAS levels due to their gear and foams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. A 2022 study found that frequent blood or plasma donation reduced firefighters' PFAS levels by up to 30% within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.

[!INFO]
[[Efforts to mitigate PFAS exposure and regulatory challenges | We are still years away]] from proper medical treatment and comprehensive PFAS regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. While some countries are banning PFAS in hygiene products, cosmetics, and food packaging, a complete ban is not yet feasible due to reliance on these chemicals in essential applications like medical implants and semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. PFAS are also used in vaccine manufacturing tubing and space suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

The situation with PFAS mirrors past environmental challenges like [[the_controversy_and_consequences_of_leaded_gasoline | leaded gasoline]], [[cfcs_and_their_environmental_effects | Freon]], and asbestos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. As consumers become more aware of the risks, their demand for PFAS-free products is prompting companies to voluntarily remove these chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. With ongoing research and informed public discourse, there is hope that society will phase out these chemicals as it has done before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.

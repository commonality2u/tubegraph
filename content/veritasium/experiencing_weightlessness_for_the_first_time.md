The experience of weightlessness can be "totally freaky" and "way better than expected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This profound sensation was achieved aboard a Zero-G plane in France, as part of an invitation from YouTuber Bruce, also featuring Diana, the Physics Girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## [[the_physics_behind_creating_zero_gravity_environments | The Physics Behind Creating Zero Gravity Environments]]

The principle of weightlessness is straightforward: a plane and everything within it must accelerate towards Earth at the same rate as a freely falling object in a vacuum, which is 9.8 meters per second squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This means there's no contact force between an object and its container, making the object feel weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### The Parabolic Maneuver
Contrary to simply diving, the process involves a specific parabolic trajectory:
1.  **Climb Phase (Hyper-G)**: The plane begins climbing at a steadily increasing angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. During this phase, passengers are pressed into the floor with a force 1.8 times their body weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This "hyper-G" effect, caused by the plane's upward acceleration perpendicular to the floor, makes standing difficult and can cause blood to drain to the feet, leading to dizziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. To combat motion sickness, also known as the "vomit comet," it's advised to lie on one's back and avoid head movements, as the vestibular system becomes hypersensitive in hyper-G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
2.  **Parabolic Trajectory (Weightlessness)**: Once the plane is climbing at approximately 50 degrees, the engines are throttled down, and the plane enters a parabolic trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It's at this point that weightlessness begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The plane and its contents are still moving upward, but accelerating downward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Throughout this phase, which lasts about 22 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, pilots skillfully adjust thrust to counteract air resistance and maintain the precise acceleration of a free-falling object in a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  **Pull-Out Phase (Hyper-G return)**: After 22 seconds of weightlessness, pilots pull out of the dive, once again subjecting occupants to hyper-G as the plane accelerates upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

In total, thirteen zero-G parabolas were performed, alongside one Martian gravity and two Moon gravity parabolas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Several experiments were conducted to observe phenomena under different gravitational conditions.

### [[Effects of zero gravity on fire and flames | Effects of Zero Gravity on Fire and Flames]]
Flames typically have a distinctive shape due to gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The hot products of combustion are less dense and experience a buoyant force greater than their weight, causing hot air to rise and draw in oxygen to sustain the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

*   **In 1g:** A barbecue lighter flame appears as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **In Hyper-G:** The effect of gravity is almost doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This magnifies the difference in weight between hot and cool air, causing the hot air to rise faster and resulting in a longer flame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **In Zero-G:** With much less buoyant force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, and no weight or buoyant force, the flame does not rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Combustion is less efficient, producing a lot of smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. While the flame from the lighter maintained some shape due to fuel flow, otherwise it would form a sphere, as seen on the International Space Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Maintaining combustion in space is challenging because combustion products can prevent oxygen from reaching the fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Observing a flame can be a good way to determine the gravitational acceleration of an environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### [[rotating_bodies_in_microgravity | Rotating Bodies in Microgravity]]: The Slinky Experiment
A slinky was brought along to observe its behavior in zero-G, specifically a slow-motion slinky drop concept without gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Since it couldn't dangle under its own weight, it was swung around a head to stretch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The idea was for each coil to stretch to provide the tension needed for the uniform circular motion of the slinky beyond that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Upon release, the slinky remained fairly stretched out and continued rotating at roughly the same frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The reason it didn't contract is that its stretch was initially due to rotation, not weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. As it continued rotating, the same amount of tension was required to maintain that circular motion, preventing it from contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. In zero-G, a stretched slinky can rotate in place without contracting as long as the tension provides the centripetal force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Challenging Intuition
The experience of weightlessness, particularly the slinky experiment, challenged deeply ingrained intuition, which is primarily formed from experiences within Earth's gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This highlights the critical need for [[conducting_experiments_in_zero_gravity | research in zero-G]] to better understand physics outside of terrestrial assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The experience was made possible by the team at NovaSpace and by Bruce of e-penser for the invitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

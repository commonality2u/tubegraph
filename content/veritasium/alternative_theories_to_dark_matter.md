While the existence of [[History of dark matter hypothesis | dark matter]] is the prevailing theory to explain various cosmic observations, alternative explanations propose modifications to the laws of physics, specifically gravity, rather than invoking unseen particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

## Modified Gravity (MOND)
One significant alternative is Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which suggests that the centripetal acceleration observed in the outer regions of galaxies is not due to additional gravitational pull from [[Dark matter interaction with ordinary matter | dark matter]], but rather a fundamental limit to how low acceleration can go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

Proponents of this view argue that instead of postulating an unseen substance, it is more logical to modify the known laws of physics to account for observed phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## Evidence Against Alternative Theories
The scientific consensus largely favors the existence of [[Dark matter interaction with ordinary matter | dark matter]] as a physical substance over modified gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. This is supported by several lines of evidence that the [[Dark matter hypothesis | dark matter hypothesis]] can explain, but modified gravity theories struggle with:

*   **Bullet Cluster:** The collision of two galaxy clusters, known as the Bullet Cluster, provides strong evidence for dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. In this event, the ordinary interstellar gas of the colliding clusters slowed down and became concentrated in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. However, gravitational lensing revealed that most of the mass is located on either side of the gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This is explained by dark matter passing through the collision unimpeded, unlike the ordinary matter, thus creating gravitational lensing where visible matter is scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.
*   **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** Observations of the [[Cosmic background radiation and dark matter | cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), the oldest light in the universe, also support the dark matter hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. The patterns of temperature differences in the CMB can be represented graphically, and the height of these peaks depends on the amount of dark matter present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. To match CMB measurements, approximately five times more dark matter than ordinary matter is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. This figure is consistent with the amounts needed to explain galactic and cluster dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

The ability of the [[Dark matter hypothesis | dark matter hypothesis]] to explain multiple distinct observations within a single theoretical framework — that there is an undetected particle that primarily interacts through gravity — is a key reason for its widespread acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3N+1 problem, is a simple mathematical conjecture that has remained unsolved by even the world's best mathematicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, stated that "Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions" when referring to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Among professional mathematicians, it is considered "infamous," with a stigma attached to those who publicly admit to working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## The Collatz Conjecture: Rules and Names

The rules for the Collatz conjecture are straightforward:
1.  **If the number is odd**: Multiply it by three and add one (3N+1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
2.  **If the number is even**: Divide it by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The conjecture posits that if these rules are applied repeatedly to any positive integer, the sequence will eventually end up in a "four, two, one loop" (4 → 2 → 1 → 4...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The numbers generated by this process are called **hailstone numbers** because their values can fluctuate, rising and falling like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one (or are thought to) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The problem has multiple origin stories and names, including:
*   Collatz conjecture (named after German mathematician Luther Collatz, who may have conceived it in the 1930s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   Ulam conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Kakutani's problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   Thwaites conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   Hasse's algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   The Syracuse problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Simply 3N+1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

### Example: Starting with Seven

Applying the rules to the number seven:
*   7 (odd) → (3 × 7) + 1 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   22 (even) → 22 / 2 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   11 (odd) → (3 × 11) + 1 = 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   34 (even) → 34 / 2 = 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   17 (odd) → (3 × 17) + 1 = 52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   52 (even) → 52 / 2 = 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   26 (even) → 26 / 2 = 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   13 (odd) → (3 × 13) + 1 = 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   40 (even) → 40 / 2 = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   20 (even) → 20 / 2 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   10 (even) → 10 / 2 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   5 (odd) → (3 × 5) + 1 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
*   16 (even) → 16 / 2 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   8 (even) → 8 / 2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   4 (even) → 4 / 2 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   2 (even) → 2 / 2 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

Once a sequence reaches 1, it enters the 4, 2, 1 loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The "total stopping time" is the number of steps it takes for a sequence to reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. For example, 26 takes 10 steps to reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, while 27 climbs to 9,232 and takes 111 steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Challenges and Insights

The Collatz conjecture is considered a "dangerous problem" because young mathematicians are warned not to spend their time on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, as it has proven intractable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Jeffrey Lagarias, considered the world authority on 3x+1, advises against working on it for career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

It initially seems counterintuitive that numbers should always decrease, as odd numbers are more than tripled while even numbers are only halved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. However, every time an odd number is multiplied by three and one is added, the result is *always* an even number, which then must be divided by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This means odd numbers are effectively increased by a factor of about 3/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Statistically, considering the multiple divisions by two that often follow, the geometric mean of the factor is 3/4 (less than one), suggesting that sequences are more likely to shrink than grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Observed Patterns

Despite the erratic nature of individual hailstone sequences, some patterns emerge when observing them in aggregate:

*   **Randomness and Brownian Motion**: The paths of hailstone numbers exhibit a pattern of randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. When plotted on a logarithmic scale, their fluctuations show a downward trend, similar to the stock market on a bad day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This behavior is an example of geometric Brownian motion, where fluctuations are random after removing a linear trend, akin to flipping a coin at each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Benford's Law**: When analyzing the leading digits of numbers in a large collection of hailstone sequences, they conform to Benford's law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This law predicts that lower digits (like '1') appear as the leading digit more frequently than higher digits (like '9') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. For instance, approximately 30% of numbers start with one, while fewer than 5% start with nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Benford's law applies to various natural datasets, including populations, company values, and physical constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, and is even used in fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. However, its conformity does not prove the Collatz conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Visualizing the Paths

The sequences can be visualized in a [[mathematical_permutations_and_loops | directed graph]], where each number connects to the next in its sequence, resembling a tree or merging streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. If the conjecture is true, all numbers would eventually flow into the single "massive river of four, two, one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Another visualization involves rotating the graph at each number (anticlockwise for odd, clockwise for even) to create intricate, organic shapes resembling coral or seaweed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Potential Disproofs and Progress Towards Proof

The Collatz conjecture could be disproved in two ways:
1.  **Divergent sequence**: A number generates a sequence that grows to infinity without ever reaching the 4, 2, 1 loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
2.  **Alternative loop**: A sequence forms a closed loop different from 4, 2, 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Despite extensive brute-force testing of numbers up to 2^68 (approximately 295 quintillion numbers), no such counterexample or alternative loop has been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Calculations suggest that any other loop would need to be at least 186 billion numbers long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

The search for counterexamples is challenging because the space of possibilities is too vast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. For context, the Polya conjecture, proposed in 1919, was disproven in 1958 by a counterexample at 1.845 × 10^361, a number vastly larger than what has been tested for 3x+1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

### Proving the Conjecture

A common approach to proving the Collatz conjecture is to show that every sequence must contain a number smaller than its original seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. If this could be proven, it would imply that all sequences must eventually descend to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Significant progress has been made:
*   **Riho Terras (1976)**: Showed that "almost all" Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Improvements (1979, 1994)**: The limit for "almost all numbers" was progressively lowered, meaning numbers reached values less than X to the power of 0.869 (1979) and then 0.7925 (1994) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Terry Tao (2019)**: Demonstrated that "almost all numbers" will end up smaller than any arbitrarily slow-growing function f(x) (e.g., log x, log log x) as x goes to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This means that for "almost all numbers," an arbitrarily small number can be guaranteed in its sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

While these results are impressive and "about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture without actually solving it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, "almost all" has a specific mathematical meaning (the fraction of numbers that obey the criteria goes to one as the range goes to infinity) and does not equate to "all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. For example, "almost all numbers" are not perfect squares, yet there are infinitely many perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Negative Numbers and Undecidability

If the rules are applied to negative numbers, instead of a single loop, there are three independent [[mathematical_permutations_and_loops | loops]]:
*   (-1) → (-2) → (-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>
*   (-5) → (-14) → (-7) → (-20) → (-10) → (-5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>
*   (-17) → (-50) → (-25) → (-74) → (-37) → (-110) → (-55) → (-164) → (-82) → (-41) → (-122) → (-61) → (-182) → (-91) → (-272) → (-136) → (-68) → (-34) → (-17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>

The existence of these disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line raises questions about why the positive side appears to have only one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

It is also possible that the Collatz conjecture is undecidable, meaning it can never be proven true or false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. In 1987, John Conway created a generalization of 3x+1 called FRACTRAN, a Turing-complete mathematical machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. As such, FRACTRAN is subject to the halting problem (the possibility that the machine never stops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. While this doesn't directly prove the Collatz conjecture is undecidable, it suggests the possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

The Collatz conjecture showcases the peculiar and intricate nature of numbers, where simple operations can lead to seemingly intractable problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

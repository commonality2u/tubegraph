## Defining a Jump
For an action to be considered a "jump," it must meet two specific criteria:
1.  Motion must be created by pushing off the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This excludes mechanisms like quad-copters, which push off the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  No mass can be lost during the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This rules out rockets, which constantly eject fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, or an arrow launched from a bow, unless the bow accompanies the arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Animal Jumping
Many animals, from sand fleas to kangaroos, launch themselves into the air using a single stroke of their muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The height of the jump is determined by the amount of energy delivered in that single stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. To jump higher, an animal must maximize its muscle strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The Galago, or Bush baby, is considered the best jumper in the animal kingdom, dedicating 30% of its entire muscle mass to jumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This allows the squirrel-sized primate to leap over two meters from a standstill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Its jumping ability comes from having more muscle dedicated to the task, not from superior muscle quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This can be seen as an example of [[comparative_analysis_of_jumping_in_animals_and_robots | comparative analysis of jumping in animals and robots]].

## Engineered Jumpers and Energy Storage
Basic jumping toys, like poppers, store energy in their deformed shape, acting as a spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Similar to animals, they release this stored energy in a single stroke to launch themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. All elastic jumpers follow this principle: energy is stored in a spring and then released in one rapid motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### World Record Jumping Robot
A tiny robot, weighing less than a tennis ball, holds the world record for jumping height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It can reach 31 meters, surpassing the previous record of 3.7 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This height is comparable to a 10-story building or from the Statue of Liberty's feet to its eye level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

#### Potential Applications
Despite appearing niche, engineered jumpers are ideal for [[potential_applications_for_jumping_robots | exploring other worlds]], especially those with thin or non-existent atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. On the Moon, with one-sixth of Earth's gravity, this robot could leap 125 meters high and half a kilometer forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Jumpers could navigate terrains challenging for rovers, such as steep cliffs and deep craters, by hopping in and out to fetch samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. They are energy-efficient; if [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] could be stored back in the spring upon landing, efficiency could be near perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

A fleet of these [[jumping_robot_engineering_and_design | jumping robots]] is under development, including models that can right themselves after landing for immediate re-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> and steerable versions with three adjustable legs for directional launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Robot Engineering and Design
The robot's core structure consists of four carbon fiber pieces bound by elastic bands, forming a spring that stores jump energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. A small motor at the top winds a string connected to the robot's bottom, compressing the structure and storing energy in the carbon fiber and rubber bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Maximum compression is reached after about 90 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. A trigger releases a latch, unspooling the string and releasing the stored energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

The jumper accelerates from standstill to over 100 kilometers per hour in only nine milliseconds, resulting in an acceleration exceeding 300 g's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Special Design Features
The robot's exceptional height is attributed to three main design features:
1.  **Incredibly Lightweight** At just 30 grams, the robot uses a tiny motor and battery. Its entire structure, made of lightweight carbon fiber and rubber, doubles as the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Natural latex rubber is highly efficient, storing 7,000 joules per kilogram, more than almost any other elastic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
2.  **Optimal Spring Design** Initial designs using only rubber bands or only carbon fiber slats had inefficiencies in their force profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The final hybrid design achieves an almost flat force profile over its entire compression range, allowing for double the energy storage of a typical spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Researchers consider this the most efficient spring ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
3.  **Strategic Weight Distribution** Counter-intuitively, adding a "chunk of steel" to the top of the jumper can make it jump higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This is because the moving body needs to weigh at least as much as the foot to ensure efficient energy transfer during the collision with the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Work Multiplication
The key to the robot's height is "work multiplication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Unlike animals, which use a single muscle stroke, engineered jumpers can store energy from many strokes or, in this case, many revolutions of its motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This allows a small motor to gradually build up a large amount of energy over several minutes, trading time for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. A latch under tension prevents the spring from unspooling until full compression is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

While biological organisms like the sand flea use latches to store energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, no organism has internally developed "work multiplication" for a jump from standstill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, external examples exist, such as spider monkeys pulling back a branch hand-over-hand to catapult themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, or "slingshot spiders" pulling back a silky string multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Limitations and Future Potential
Work multiplication allows the motor's power to no longer be the limiting factor for jump height; instead, the spring becomes the primary constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The current design is near its theoretical maximum, with only about 19% higher jump possible even with an infinitely light motor and unlimited winding time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

To achieve even higher jumps, especially considering air resistance and aerodynamics, scaling the jumper up is an option. Making it 10 times larger isometrically could lead to a 15-20% higher jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This is because while cross-sectional area (and thus drag) increases by a factor of 100, the mass (and inertia) increases by a factor of 1,000, making the drag force proportionally less impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

The concept of work multiplication could revolutionize robotics, enabling robots to store and release massive amounts of energy, overcoming the current size limitations of motors for portable devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This [[jumping_robot_engineering_and_design | engineering and design]] is a testament to the application of [[applying_physics_in_educational_demonstrations | physics]] principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

The Rubens tube is an experimental device used to visualize [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|standing waves]] [00:00:28]. It consists of a pipe with multiple holes, into which a flammable gas is pumped and ignited, creating a row of Bunsen burners [00:00:15].

## Principle of Operation
When sounds are played into the Rubens tube, they can set up [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|standing waves]] within the pipe [00:00:28]. These waves create patterns of air [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|vibration]] where some parts of the tube have a lot of [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|vibration]] (anti-nodes) and other parts have very little [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|vibration]] (nodes) [00:00:33]. This [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|vibration]] directly affects the flow rate of the gas from the tube into the atmosphere, which in turn influences the height of the flames [00:00:38]. Taller flames indicate an anti-node (more [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|vibration]] and gas flow), while shorter flames or no flames indicate a node (less [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|vibration]] and gas flow) [00:02:51]. This allows for a direct visualization of the [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|standing wave pattern]] [00:00:48].

## The Pyro Board: A 2D Rubens Tube
A team of physics and chemistry demonstrators in Denmark took the Rubens tube concept to the next level by creating a two-dimensional version, effectively a "whole plane of Bunsen burners" [00:00:52]. This device, known as the "Pyro Board," features 2,500 holes [00:01:02]. The motivation behind its creation was simple: "when you put on more fire, then it always gets better" [00:01:14].

## Visualizing and Hearing Standing Waves
On the Pyro Board, [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|standing waves]] are created by adjusting the frequency of the sound played into the system [00:01:25]. The lowest frequency that produces a [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|standing wave]] is considered the "fundamental" [00:01:49]. Varying the volume of the sound can also have a dramatic effect on the flame patterns [00:01:59].

A unique observation made with the Pyro Board is that one can hear the differences between nodes and anti-nodes [00:02:27]. In anti-node regions, where the flames are higher, the sound pressure is greater [00:02:42]. Conversely, in node regions, the sound pressure is much lower, aligning with the shorter or absent flames [00:02:48]. The flames visibly come out in the [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|anti-nodes]] [00:02:51].

As the frequency of the sound increases, different and more complex [[wave_dynamics_and_properties|standing wave patterns]] can be observed on the Pyro Board [00:03:04]. Playing music through the system also generates dynamic and visually pleasing flame patterns that correspond to the audio's frequencies and amplitudes [00:03:36].

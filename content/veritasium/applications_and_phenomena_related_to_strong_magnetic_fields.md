Strong magnetic fields enable a variety of phenomena and have significant applications in scientific research and technology. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida, has held the Guinness World Record for the [[properties_and_capabilities_of_the_worlds_strongest_magnet | strongest continuous magnetic field]] since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This powerful electromagnet is capable of sucking in objects, generating electric current, and levitating non-magnetic items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Properties of the World's Strongest Magnet

The world's strongest magnet creates a magnetic field of 45 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For context, the Earth's magnetic field is 0.00005 Tesla, a fridge magnet is around 0.01 Tesla, and MRI machines can reach up to 3 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The 45 Tesla magnet is nearly a million times stronger than Earth's magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The magnet's maximum field, or field center, exists within a narrow cylinder in its middle, which is only about a centimeter tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Experiments are often conducted in the "fringe field" that extends above and around the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. While weaker than the core 45 Tesla field, the fringe field is still potent enough to be dangerous, as evidenced by an incident where a chair was accelerated across a cell, tearing out its internal components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Ferromagnetic objects or individuals with metallic implants or pacemakers must remain outside the 100 Gauss line of the fringe field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Phenomena of Strong Magnetic Fields

### Attraction of Ferromagnetic Materials

One obvious effect of a strong magnetic field is the attraction of [[magnetic_properties_and_materials | magnetic materials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This can be demonstrated by inserting steel washers into a Nerf football, which then becomes noticeably attracted to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Ferrofluid, a liquid containing nanoscale pieces of magnetite (an iron-containing mineral), visually demonstrates magnetic fields. When placed in an external magnetic field, the magnetite particles align, causing the ferrofluid to form parallel ridges and even spikes on its surface as it gets closer to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### The Nature of Magnetism

The phenomenon of magnetism was first discovered at least 3000 years ago through naturally magnetized pieces of magnetite found in Magnesia, Greece, which is the origin of the word "magnet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. These "lodestones" could attract iron or each other, and by the 11th century in China, they were used to create compass needles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Materials are magnetic due to their electrons, which are essentially tiny magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. In most atoms, electrons are paired with opposite spins, canceling out their magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However, in elements with half-full outer shells, electrons can't pair up, leading to atoms with inherent magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. For a bulk material to be magnetic, these atomic magnetic fields must align, often within "domains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. If domains are misaligned, the material is non-magnetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Applying a strong external magnetic field can align these domains, thereby magnetizing the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Materials that meet these criteria, like iron, nickel, and cobalt, are called ferromagnetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Interaction with Non-Ferromagnetic Materials (Lenz's Law)

Surprisingly, strong magnetic fields also affect non-ferromagnetic materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. When conductive materials (like copper or aluminum) move through a magnetic field, the changing magnetic flux induces electric currents, known as eddy currents, within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. These eddy currents create their own magnetic field that opposes the change in flux, a principle known as Lenz's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This causes conductive materials to fall much slower or be repelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Examples of Lenz's Law in action:
*   **Slowing Fall**: Metal plates dropped through the magnet's fringe field fall significantly slower than non-conductive materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The induced eddy currents also dissipate energy as heat, causing the plate to warm up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Movement**: An aluminum cylinder refuses to roll across the magnet's top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. A volleyball wrapped in aluminum foil also experiences significant deceleration when passed or dropped through the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Opposing Force**: If one tries to pull a conductive plate away from the magnet, a magnetic pole is induced that attracts it back to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Pushing it down quickly also induces currents that oppose the motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Projectiles**: Projectiles fired from a potato cannon across the magnet are decelerated and rotated to align with the magnetic field lines, minimizing the change in flux they experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Projectiles containing wire coils connected to LEDs light up as they pass through the field, demonstrating the induced currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Superconducting Levitation

When a material like a superconductor, with zero electrical resistance below its critical temperature, is brought near a magnet, induced currents persist indefinitely and expel all magnetic fields. This is part of the Meissner effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. However, some superconductors have engineered defects (non-superconducting filaments) that can trap magnetic field lines, "locking" the superconductor in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

This principle is used in a "human levitator," where a 90-pound magnet hovers above a ring of superconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. When a person stands on the magnet, the increase in magnetic flux is opposed by currents in the superconductors, creating a repulsive magnetic field that causes levitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

### Diamagnetism and Paramagnetism

All materials possess [[magnetic_properties_and_materials | magnetic properties]], though they are typically only observable in strong magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

*   **Paramagnetism**: Some materials are always attracted to magnetic fields. In the presence of an external field, their internal magnetic fields strengthen the overall field, causing attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Liquid oxygen is an example of a paramagnetic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Diamagnetism**: Most materials are repelled by a strong enough magnetic field, regardless of the pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. In an external field, their molecules effectively become opposing magnets and are repelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Water is a good example of a diamagnetic material; bringing a magnet close to its surface creates an indent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Diamagnetism allows for the levitation of objects not typically considered magnetic in strong enough fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This includes strawberries, raspberries, and even living organisms, as they contain significant amounts of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Frogs, grasshoppers, and mice have been successfully levitated in experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. These [[applications_in_aerospace_and_space_technology | levitation experiments with living organisms]] help understand the effects of weightlessness without needing to go into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

While there are no lasting long-term effects on living things from strong magnetic fields, there is a possibility of polarizing the stones in the inner ear, which can cause rodents to spin in circles for a few minutes after exiting the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

## Construction and Energy Requirements

### [[construction_and_design_of_high_field_magnets | Construction and Design of High-Field Magnets]]

Achieving extremely high magnetic fields requires a combination of technologies. Superconducting magnets alone have a limit, typically around 20 Tesla, before they cease to be superconducting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. The solution is to combine an outer superconducting electromagnet with an inner resistive magnet made of ordinary wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

*   The outer superconducting "outsert" produces 11.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   The inner resistive magnet produces 33.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
*   These fields add up to create the total 45 Tesla field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

Building high-field resistive magnets is challenging due to the immense heat generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Traditional wire-wound electromagnets are limited to about 2 Tesla because heat cannot be effectively removed from the innermost windings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. In the 1950s, Francis Bitter developed the "Bitter plate" design, where round wire is flattened into thin plates stacked with alternating insulators to form a helix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This design allows cooling water to be pushed axially through the stack, removing heat from the innermost parts and enabling much higher currents (up to 57,000 amps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. These stacks are aligned, compressed with 20 tons of force, and locked down to ensure electrical connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. Thousands of gallons per minute of deionized water are continuously pushed through the coils to prevent melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

Despite these advanced designs, material failure can occur when components go past their plastic limit and deform, leading to short circuits and vaporization of metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

### Energy Consumption and Research

Running the world's strongest magnets requires vast amounts of energy. The Mag Lab consumes about 8% of Tallahassee's total electricity generating capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, with an electricity budget of $250,000 to $300,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. The lab operates within the city's federally mandated reserve, providing a revenue stream for the utility for power it must produce but cannot otherwise sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

The primary purpose of such strong magnetic fields is material discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. They provide an extreme environment—along with high electric fields, high pressure, and ultra-low temperatures—to study and improve materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. By exposing existing materials to these conditions or by significantly reducing impurities, researchers can observe new properties and phenomena that were previously undetectable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. This field is still in its early stages, with significant potential for future discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

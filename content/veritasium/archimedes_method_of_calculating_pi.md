From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

For approximately 2000 years, the most successful technique for calculating Pi involved a painstakingly slow and tedious method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This approach was centered around approximating the circumference of a circle by inscribing and circumscribing polygons with an increasing number of sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Early Approximations

It was known for millennia that Pi must be between three and four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This can be demonstrated by:
*   Inscribing a regular hexagon inside a circle: With sides of length one, the hexagon's perimeter is six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. If the circle's diameter is two (making its radius one), the circumference must be larger than six, so Pi (circumference/diameter) must be greater than three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Drawing a square around the circle: The square's perimeter is eight, which is larger than the circle's circumference, thus Pi must be less than four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Archimedes' Refinement

Around 250 BC, [[history_of_calculating_pi | Archimedes]] significantly improved upon this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>:
1.  **Starting Point** He began with an inscribed hexagon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
2.  **Bisecting Polygons** He then bisected the hexagon to create a 12-sided regular polygon (dodecagon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. He calculated its perimeter, which provided a tighter lower bound for Pi when divided by the diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. He applied the same process to a circumscribed 12-gon to find an upper bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
3.  **Complex Calculations** These calculations were intricate, requiring the extraction of square roots and square roots of square roots, all converted into fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
4.  **Iterative Process** [[history_of_calculating_pi | Archimedes]] continued this bisection, moving from the 12-gon to the 24-gon, and then to the 48-gon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
5.  **Final Result** By the time he reached the 96-gon, he had derived Pi to be between 3.1408 and 3.1429 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This level of precision, achieved over 2000 years ago, was remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Legacy and Limitations

For the next two millennia, mathematicians worldwide continued to refine this method of bisecting polygons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Chinese, Indian, Persian, and Arab mathematicians all contributed to improving these bounds along the lines of [[history_of_calculating_pi | Archimedes']] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Notable later efforts included:
*   **Francois Viete (late 16th century)** Doubled the sides many more times than [[history_of_calculating_pi | Archimedes]], computing the perimeter of a polygon with 393,216 sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Ludolph van Ceulen (early 17th century)** Spent 25 years on the effort, calculating the perimeter of a polygon with 2^62 sides (over 4 quintillion sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This monumental effort yielded only 35 correct decimal places of Pi, which were inscribed on his tombstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Christoph Grienberger** Surpassed Van Ceulen's record 20 years later, achieving 38 correct decimal places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Despite these advancements, the method was inherently inefficient for achieving high precision. It was largely abandoned after [[development_of_calculus_by_isaac_newton | Isaac Newton]] introduced his vastly more efficient method for calculating Pi in 1666 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The shift from [[history_of_calculating_pi | Archimedes']] geometric approach to Newton's series-based approach marked a significant [[mathematical_breakthroughs_in_the_renaissance | mathematical breakthrough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Setting the Scene

On August 21st, 2017, a [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | total solar eclipse]] occurred, with clear skies in Madras, Oregon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This location provided ideal conditions for [[observing_solar_eclipses_in_oregon | observing the solar eclipse]] and capturing its phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Essential Equipment

For capturing the eclipse, a "sky tracker" was used, designed to move the camera with the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This device compensates for the Earth's rotation, helping to keep the sun consistently in shot as the eclipse progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. After the peak of the eclipse, a solar filter was re-applied to the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The equipment, including the sky tracker and solar filters, was crucial for tracking the sun and recording the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Observational Context for Photography

During the eclipse, specific [[effects_during_a_solar_eclipse | effects]] were noted that provide context for photography:
*   **First Contact (C1)**: The moon was observed entering on the top right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Light and Temperature Changes**: Approximately 17 minutes before [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | totality]], the light noticeably dimmed, and a cold wind was felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The environment became cooler and darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Shadow Sharpness**: When the sun was about 90% covered, shadows became much sharper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Normally, shadows appear fuzzy because sunlight emanates from multiple locations, but during the eclipse, light was coming from a single sliver of the sun, making shadows very distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Totality Phenomena**: During [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | totality]], prominences and the solar Corona became visible at the top left and bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Venus was also visible directly above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The sky appeared "like a hole in the sky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | diamond ring effect]] was cheered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Atmospheric Illusions**: There was an appearance of sunset and sunrise in every direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, and a sense that "this just looks so wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Enabling the Expedition

Support from Patreon patrons made it possible to acquire the necessary flight and equipment for documenting the [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | total solar eclipse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This support was essential for the camera tracking system and solar filters, enabling the entire experience and video production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

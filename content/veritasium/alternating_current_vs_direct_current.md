Electrical energy can be transmitted and utilized in different forms, primarily Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC). While both involve the movement of charge, their fundamental characteristics and how energy is conveyed differ significantly.

## Direct Current (DC)

In a simple DC circuit powered by a battery, an electric field from the battery extends through the circuit at the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This field pushes electrons, causing them to accumulate on some conductor surfaces (making them negatively charged) and deplete elsewhere (leaving surfaces positively charged) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. These surface charges create a small electric field inside the wires, which causes electrons to drift preferentially in one direction, forming an electrical current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The drift velocity of electrons is extremely slow, around a tenth of a millimeter per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

The charge on the conductor surfaces creates an electric field outside the wires, and the current inside creates a magnetic field outside the wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. According to Poynting's theory, energy flows in the space around the circuit due to the combination of these electric and magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Energy flows radially outwards from the battery and along the wires, eventually directed into the light bulb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This demonstrates that energy is transmitted by the electric and magnetic fields, not by the electrons themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Although electrons flow two ways (away from and towards the battery), the energy flux only goes one way, from the battery to the bulb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Alternating Current (AC)

The electricity in the power grid comes in the form of alternating current (AC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. In AC, electrons in the power lines merely wiggle back and forth, never actually traveling from the power plant to the home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. A power station pushes and pulls the electrons back and forth, typically 60 times a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

When an alternating current source is used, the direction of current reverses every half cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. However, both the electric and magnetic fields flip at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Consequently, the Poynting vector, which describes the energy flux, still points in the same directionâ€”from the source to the load (e.g., bulb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Therefore, the same principles of energy transmission via electromagnetic fields apply to AC circuits as they do to DC circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Energy Transmission in AC Systems

This field-based understanding explains how energy flows from power plants to homes through power lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Inside the wires, electrons oscillate back and forth and do not carry the energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Instead, outside the wires, oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel from the power station to the home, delivering the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

This concept, though [[counterintuitive_engineering_concepts | counterintuitive]] to many, was crucial for overcoming early challenges in electrical engineering, such as with undersea telegraph cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Early attempts at transatlantic cables experienced significant signal distortion and lengthening because engineers initially believed energy flowed through the wires like water in a tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. However, it was later understood that the fields around the wires carried the energy and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The materials surrounding the cable, like an iron sheath, interfered with the propagation of electromagnetic fields by increasing the line's capacitance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This is why modern power lines are suspended high up, ensuring a large insulating gap of air separates the wires from the ground, as even damp earth acts as a conductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions about Electricity

A common [[misconceptions_about_electricity | misconception about electricity]] is that electrons themselves possess potential energy, are pushed or pulled through a continuous conducting loop, and dissipate their energy in the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This view is considered false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The energy is carried by the electric and magnetic fields *around* the conductors, not by the flow of electrons within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. For instance, in AC circuits, electrons barely move, yet energy is efficiently transmitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

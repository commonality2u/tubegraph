The Navy's Indoor Ocean at Carderock is the world's largest wave pool, designed to test scale models of ships and improve their designs before they are deployed in open oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Visitors describe the facility as an "indoor ocean" due to its immense size and ocean-colored water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Facility Specifications
The wave pool measures 360 feet long in one dimension and 240 feet long in the other, with a depth of 20 feet, making it approximately the size of a football field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The dome above the pool was, for a period, the largest free-standing dome in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Wave Generation System
The pool can generate diverse wave types using 216 individual wave makers, which are huge paddles lining two walls of the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These paddles are programmed to move in precise, choreographed ways, enabling the production of reproducible waves of specific sizes and frequencies across the entire pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The angular motion of the paddles is controlled by air bellows, and force transducers measure the forces involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The defining characteristic of this wave pool is its precise control, allowing for the repeated creation of waves with specific amplitude and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The largest wave that can be made at one Hertz is limited by the motion and power requirements of the wave makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Surreal Waves
> Observing the regular, uniform waves in the pool feels surreal because such regularity is not naturally found in the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## [[Wave physics and properties | Wave Physics and Properties]] Demonstrated
The facility is ideal for observing [[Wave physics and properties | properties of different waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Wave Characteristics
*   **Wavelength**: The distance between one wave crest and the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Energy Transmission**: Waves transmit energy, not material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Water Molecule Motion**: In ideal water waves, molecules move along circular paths as the wave travels, with the motion decreasing with depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Wave Base**: All water motion stops at a depth equal to half the wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Molecule Drift**: Even in ideal waves, molecules drift slightly in the direction of wave motion because they travel faster at the top of their loop than they move backward at the bottom, creating a spiral path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Frequency and Speed
Waves with the same amplitude but higher frequencies appear to have a greater amplitude due to a steeper slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The frequency of a wave also affects its speed: high-frequency waves travel slower than low-frequency waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. In water deeper than the wave base, wave speed is inversely proportional to its frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This speed difference is exploited in a demonstration where high-frequency waves are sent out first, followed by lower-frequency waves. Because high-frequency waves travel slower, the lower-frequency waves gradually catch up, causing all waves to meet and break at a specific point in the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Principle of Superposition
The facility beautifully illustrates the principle of superposition, where waves add together when they meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The resulting water height is the sum of the individual wave heights at that point, enabling the creation of large breaking waves from smaller individual waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

This principle is also used to create:
*   **Standing Waves ("Quilt Wave")**: Two regular waves sent towards each other create fixed points of zero amplitude and maximum amplitude, forming a quilt-like pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Bullseye Wave**: Waves sent from all directions form circular wave fronts that converge, channeling all wave energy into a single "bullseye" spot, causing the wave to break when its height exceeds one-seventh of its wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Purpose: Ship Testing and [[Ship design and innovations | Innovations]]
The primary purpose of the facility is to replicate diverse wave conditions to test scale models of Navy ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This allows engineers to observe how different ship designs behave in real-world scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Scaling Factors
For accurate representation, several factors must be considered:
*   **Water Type**: The pool uses fresh water, so models must be ballasted to account for the buoyancy difference compared to salty ocean water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Froude Number**: Unlike Reynolds number for fluid mechanics, accurate wave dynamics require scaling based on the Froude number, which measures the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. If a model ship's hull is 46 times smaller than the real ship, it should travel at 1/√46 times its real-world speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. To make footage from the model match a full-size ship, it must be slowed down by a factor of √46 (approximately 6.8 times slower) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This ensures the physics are identical to a real ship at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### [[Ship design and innovations | Ship Design and Innovations]]
The facility plays a critical role in [[Ship design and innovations | naval ship design and innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Every ship in the Navy's fleet has undergone testing or peripheral evaluation at this facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This allows for cost-effective testing of new designs, such as ships with a "tumble home" hull (shaped inward) that might have different restoring forces compared to traditional flared hulls, while also considering aspects like above-water signatures, stealth, speed, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. One key test is to observe how much water washes onto the deck, particularly for helicopter landing pads, to prevent safety issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

## [[Ocean and wave conditions in different regions | Ocean and Wave Conditions in Different Regions]]
The pool can simulate diverse wave conditions found in various parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Wave Formation Factors
Five factors influence the size and shape of waves:
1.  Wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
2.  Wind duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
3.  Fetch (distance over which wind acts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
4.  Width of the fetch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>
5.  Depth of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>

### Swell vs. Wind Waves
*   **Swell**: As waves travel away from a storm, higher-frequency waves dissipate energy more quickly. The waves that travel long distances are fast-moving, low-frequency waves, known as swell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Swell (e.g., waves crashing at a beach 10 seconds apart on a calm day) is generally not a concern for ships in the open ocean due to its long wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
    > [!NOTE] Analogy
    > The phenomenon of high frequencies dissipating quickly and low frequencies traveling further is analogous to sound: when walking away from a concert, only the bass frequencies remain audible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

*   **Wind Waves**: Formed in three steps:
    1.  Wind blowing across still water creates turbulent motion, leading to tiny ripples (around 1 cm wavelength) from pressure differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
    2.  Wind acts on these ripples, creating larger pressure differences that pull them into bigger waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
    3.  Interaction between wind and waves creates even larger pressure differences and waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. These waves are mostly uniform initially but interact to form a range of wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. As wind continues, waves break, transferring kinetic energy into swirling eddies that dissipate as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
    *   **Fully Developed Sea**: Occurs when energy dissipation equals energy input from the wind, reaching maximum wave size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
    *   **Irregular Waves**: Unlike regular waves (one frequency, one amplitude), irregular waves are "spectra," composed of multiple frequencies and amplitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Rogue Waves
Often misattributed to appearing "out of nowhere," rogue waves are typically the result of multiple waves meeting and combining their amplitudes to create a much larger wave that then breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### [[Ocean and wave conditions in different regions | Different Ocean Spectra]]
Different oceans have unique mixtures of wave frequencies, or "spectra," influenced by geography and storm types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **North Sea and small bodies of water**: Have a peakier spectrum due to limited fetch during storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Mid-Atlantic**: Characterized by a broader spectrum, typical of developing or decaying open ocean waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **North Atlantic**: Features the broadest spectrum of wind waves due to steady winds across an open ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Engineers first determine the ship's deployment location and the appropriate wave spectra before simulating conditions in the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Naval officers confirm significant differences in sea conditions across regions, such as rougher seas off South Korea in spring compared to a calmer Pacific crossing or the Arabian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Measurement and Safety
Ultrasonic sensors arranged in a large array are used to accurately measure wave height, period, and direction in the basin, ensuring testing conditions match intended simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For safety reasons, swimming in the pool during wave operations is prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Models are also tested on a carriage system for "captive model tests," where power and instrumentation can be tethered to models that cannot support them independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. The carriage then tows the model over the waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Impact
The work conducted at the Navy's Indoor Ocean at Carderock has impacted every ship and submarine in the Navy's fleet, significantly contributing to their design and operational capabilities, often without the direct awareness of the sailors themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

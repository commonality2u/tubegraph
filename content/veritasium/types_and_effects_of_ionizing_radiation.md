Radiation is often perceived as frightening, but only certain types, specifically ionizing radiation, pose significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ionizing radiation possesses enough energy to rip electrons off atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It is measured in units called Sieverts (Sv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Exposure to more than two Sieverts at once is typically fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. However, humans are constantly exposed to low levels of [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Sources of Ionizing Radiation

### Natural Background Radiation
The Earth's natural environment is a source of [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This includes radiation emitted from soil, rocks, and the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, as well as from space ([[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The average global background radiation level ranges between 0.1 and 0.2 micro Sieverts per hour (µSv/hr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. In Sydney, for example, the level is around 0.15 µSv/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Everyday Objects and Human Interaction
*   **Bananas:** Bananas are naturally radioactive due to their richness in potassium, some of which is a radioactive isotope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Eating a banana exposes a person to approximately 0.1 micro Sieverts (µSv) of radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, which is one ten-millionth of a Sievert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Other Humans:** Humans themselves become radioactive after consuming items like bananas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Consequently, sleeping next to another person exposes one to more radiation than sleeping alone, though this dose is insignificant compared to natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Non-Ionizing Radiation:** Common electronic devices like mobile phones, Wi-Fi routers, and microwaves do not emit ionizing radiation and therefore do not trigger a Geiger counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Historical and High-Exposure Locations

The level of [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | ionizing radiation]] varies significantly across different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### [[historical_nuclear_sites and their current radiation levels | Hiroshima, Japan]]
Despite being the site of the world's first nuclear bomb detonation over a city in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, the radiation level in Hiroshima almost 70 years later is only 0.3 µSv/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The bomb was detonated 600 meters above the Peace Dome to maximize destructive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Uranium Mine (Jáchymov)
An old uranium mine, where uranium was first discovered and from which Marie Curie obtained her raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, exhibits radiation levels of about 1.7 µSv/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is approximately 10 times the natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Remaining uranium ore in the mine fluoresces under UV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Marie Curie's Lab and Office
Some areas in Marie Curie's former lab and office, where she conducted significant work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, remain radioactive. The doorknob registers about 10 times background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, and alpha particles can still be detected from the back of her chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This is attributed to traces of radium left as she moved between the lab and her office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### [[historical_nuclear_sites and their current radiation levels | Trinity Bomb Test Site, New Mexico]]
The site of the world's first nuclear bomb test, set off in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, was vaporized by the bomb's heat, which fused desert sand into a green glass known as trinitite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Trinitite is unique to this location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The general radiation level at the site is about 0.8 µSv/hr, while trinitite itself can emit 2-3 µSv/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Airplanes
[[comparison_of_radiation_exposure_in_different_scenarios | Radiation exposure]] increases with altitude due to less atmospheric shielding from [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Inside an airplane, levels can reach:
*   0.5 µSv/hr at 18,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   1 µSv/hr at 23,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
*   Over 2 µSv/hr at 33,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   Over 3 µSv/hr at higher altitudes and closer to the poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>

### [[historical_nuclear_sites and their current radiation levels | Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor #4, Ukraine]]
The Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four melted down on April 26, 1986, releasing radioactive isotopes across the surrounding area and into Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Today, the contamination is still detectable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The current radiation level near the reactor is around 5 µSv/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Staying for one hour at this spot would result in a dose similar to a dental x-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The relatively lower current levels are partly due to the removal of several meters of topsoil from the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### [[historical_nuclear_sites and their current radiation levels | Fukushima Exclusion Zone, Japan]]
Entering the Fukushima exclusion zone, the Geiger counter readings increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Like Chernobyl, contaminated topsoil is being collected in black bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Although the release of radioactive material was about 10% of Chernobyl's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, the area is considered one of the most radioactive due to the freshness of the accident (only three years at the time of filming), meaning less decay has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Readings here were typically 5 to 10 µSv/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Pripyat Hospital Basement, Chernobyl Exclusion Zone
The basement of the hospital in Pripyat, where firemen from the Chernobyl reactor fire were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, holds their highly contaminated clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This location is one of the most radioactive places on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   Just outside the basement door: 500 µSv/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Inside the basement: 1,500 µSv/hr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Staying for one hour in the basement would result in a dose of 2,000 µSv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, equivalent to a year's worth of natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_radiation_exposure_in_different_scenarios | Comparative Radiation Doses]]

To provide context for various radiation exposures:
*   **Dental X-ray:** Similar to 5 µSv/hr for 1 hour at Chernobyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **CT Scan:** A patient typically receives about 7,000 µSv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, which is equivalent to 3 years of natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Fukushima Residents (Lifetime):** Estimated to receive an additional 10,000 µSv over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Radiation Workers:** Limited to a maximum of 50,000 µSv per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Astronauts:** An astronaut on the International Space Station for 6 months receives approximately 80,000 µSv of [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation exposure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Smokers:** A smoker's lungs, on average, receive 160,000 µSv of radiation every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This is due to radioactive polonium and lead present in tobacco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This exposure, combined with carcinogens and toxins, highlights the significant [[health_risks_associated_with_smoking_and_radiation_exposure | health risks associated with smoking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

Ultimately, ordinary smokers receive the highest doses of [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | ionizing radiation]] annually, surpassing even those in historically radioactive areas, radiation workers, or astronauts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

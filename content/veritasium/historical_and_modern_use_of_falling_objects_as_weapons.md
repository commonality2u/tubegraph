The concept of dropping objects from height has long captured the imagination, with popular myths questioning the danger of simple items like a penny dropped from a skyscraper. While a penny is unlikely to cause harm, history and modern warfare show that falling objects can indeed be deadly when specific physical properties are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Debunking the Myth: The Penny and the Pen

A common urban legend suggests that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This myth is widely known, with people even throwing pennies off the Empire State Building's observation deck ledges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

A penny weighs about 2.5 grams, which is a quarter to half the weight of a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Ignoring air resistance, a penny dropped from the Empire State Building (443 meters tall) would theoretically accelerate to over 300 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, this calculation ignores the critical factor of air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### The Role of Air Resistance and Terminal Velocity

[[impact_of_dropping_a_penny_from_a_skyscraper | The impact of dropping a penny from a skyscraper]] is primarily governed by air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Unlike in a vacuum, where a hammer and feather fall at the same rate, on Earth, air resistance significantly affects lighter objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. An object reaches its terminal velocity when the force of gravity equals the force of air resistance, at which point it stops accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

*   **Pennies:** Pennies reach terminal velocity after falling only about 15 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Their maximum speed is about 80 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This speed is fast enough to sting, but not cause significant injury or be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Pennies also flutter and tumble as they fall, making them difficult to aim and giving them two oscillating terminal velocities (on face and on edge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Ballpoint Pens:** Some have suggested ballpoint pens dropped from skyscrapers could be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. These pens weigh about twice as much as a penny and have a smaller cross-sectional area, which could increase their terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. However, [[testing_and_experiments_with_kinetic_projectiles | experiments]] with plastic pens showed that they still have too much drag relative to their weight to achieve a high terminal velocity, and thus are not dangerous when dropped from tall objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **Bullets:** A bullet dropped from a skyscraper would likely tumble and fall on its side, experiencing significant air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. It would not maintain its aerodynamic shape for vertical descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

> *   A raindrop delivers about 0.002 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

> *   A baseball or the largest hailstones can deliver more than 80 Joules, enough to crack a skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

## When Falling Objects Become Dangerous

For a falling object to be dangerous, it generally needs to weigh more than a few hundred grams and travel at a high terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. The object's shape and density (captured by its Drag Coefficient) also play a crucial role in its terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

*   **Hail:** Hail can reach terminal velocities exceeding 200 kilometers per hour, about 10 times that of rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This is because hailstones can grow much larger (up to 20 centimeters in diameter), and while drag scales with radius squared, weight scales with radius cubed, leading to higher terminal velocities for larger hailstones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Hail injures around 20 people and causes approximately four fatalities annually in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Celebratory Gunfire:** If a bullet is fired almost vertically, it will tumble on its way down and lose significant energy, making it much slower when it hits the ground than when it was shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. However, if a bullet is fired at an angle, it maintains its horizontal velocity and spin, keeping it pointy-side forward. This allows it to reach a significant fraction of its launch speed on the way down, leading to hundreds of cases of people being struck and killed by celebratory gunfire worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

## Falling Objects as Weapons in Warfare

The idea of dropping deadly projectiles on enemies is nearly as old as aircraft themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

### World War I: Fléchettes

In World War I, small pieces of metal called fléchettes (French for "little arrow") were dropped from planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. These were designed like nails with small feathers on the back to ensure they fell straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Some were up to 15 centimeters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

*   **Advantages:** They required no explosives, were cheap to produce, and easy to deploy at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
*   **Impact:** Fléchettes could pierce helmets, causing enemy casualties and severe injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. There are accounts of them going through a rider and his horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:19:01]</a>.

### Korean and Vietnam Wars: Lazy Dogs

Later, the US military developed similar weapons called Lazy Dogs, which were heavier than fléchettes and used in the Korean and Vietnam wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. While their damage was indiscriminate and unpredictable, they had the advantage of not leaving unexploded ordnance in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

### Modern Use of [[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | Kinetic Projectiles]]

Militaries continue to use [[the_role_of_kinetic_weapons_in_science_fiction | kinetic projectiles]] for precision strikes, such as targeting terrorist leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. This implies a continued focus on using falling objects with high kinetic energy for targeted damage. While not explicitly detailed in the transcript, this touches upon concepts similar to [[history_and_development_of_project_thor | Project Thor]].

## [[safety_and_risks_of_falling_objects_in_urban_environments | Dangers of Falling Objects in Civilian Life]]

Beyond deliberate warfare, falling objects pose significant dangers in everyday civilian life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Nearly 700 Americans die each year from being struck by falling objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

These include:
*   Loose tiles and bricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>
*   Falling construction tools (e.g., a measuring tape falling 50 stories killed a man in 2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>
*   Falling rocks and tree branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>
*   Icicles (a serious concern, leading to street closures around New York's One World Trade Center in 2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>

While the kinetic energy of a falling fléchette might not be enough to crack a skull via blunt force trauma, its ability to apply a large force to a very small area makes it dangerous through penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

In summary, objects weighing only a few grams that are not aerodynamic, like pennies or plastic pens, are generally not fatal when dropped from height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. However, objects weighing more than a few hundred grams traveling at terminal velocity, or those designed to maintain an aerodynamic shape and concentrate force, are very likely to be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

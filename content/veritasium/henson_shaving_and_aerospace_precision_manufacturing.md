Henson Shaving is a company that emerged from an aerospace machine shop [00:23:56]. This shop was responsible for building parts for significant space exploration projects, including the [[Mars rover]] and the International Space Station (ISS) [00:23:59]. This background imbues Henson Shaving with expertise in precise, high-quality manufacturing [00:24:02].

## Aerospace Precision in Manufacturing

The level of precision required for aerospace components is extremely high. For instance, if the temperature during the manufacturing process of rover parts changed by as little as one degree, the entire piece had to be scrapped [00:24:05]. This commitment to extreme precision is a core principle of Henson Shaving's design and manufacturing philosophy [00:24:11].

## The AL13 Razor: Applying Aerospace Standards

Henson Shaving applies this aerospace-level precision to its products, notably the AL13 razor [00:24:34].

### Addressing Common Shaving Issues
Traditional razors often cause issues because their blades flex and bend upon contact with the skin [00:24:14]. This movement can lead to micro-cuts, skin irritation, and razor bumps [00:24:21].

### Design and Benefits of the AL13 Razor
The AL13 razor is engineered to mitigate these problems through its precise design:
*   **Blade Extension** The blade extends past the shave plane by exactly 0.0013 inches, which is less than the width of a human hair [00:24:37].
*   **Secure Fastening** The blade is securely fastened at an exact angle of 30 degrees [00:24:45].
*   **Reduced Blade Flex** This secure fastening results in almost zero blade flex [00:24:48], leading to a smoother and cleaner shave [00:24:50].

## Longevity and Cost-Effectiveness
Designed to last a lifetime [00:24:52], the AL13 razor uses standard double-edged blades that cost around 10 cents each [00:24:56]. This makes the cost of ownership for an AL13 razor lower than most cartridge or electric razors after only two years [00:24:58]. Beyond economic benefits, owning one razor for life is both more convenient and environmentally friendly [00:25:07].

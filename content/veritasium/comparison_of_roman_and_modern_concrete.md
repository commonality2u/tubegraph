Concrete, a substance used for millennia, has evolved significantly from its primitive forms to the sophisticated materials used in modern construction. While both Roman and modern concrete are foundational to large-scale infrastructure, they differ in composition, hardening processes, and properties.

## What is Concrete?

To clarify, [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] is the "glue" or matrix material, while concrete is [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] combined with aggregates like gravel and sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | Cement]] is the most important man-made substance on the planet, with more of it used annually than any other substance apart from water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Annually, 500 kilograms of [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] are created for every person on Earth, enough to make two cubic meters of concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Concrete is highly valued because it acts as a "liquid rock" that can be poured into any shape, is strong, durable, inexpensive, and easy to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Historical Development

People have been making versions of concrete for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, contributing to the [[historical_development_of_concrete | historical development of concrete]].

### Primitive Cement

The key ingredient for primitive cement is limestone, which is primarily calcium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Heating limestone to around 1,000 degrees Celsius drives off CO2, leaving calcium oxide, also known as quicklime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Grinding calcium oxide and mixing it with water produces an exothermic reaction that creates calcium hydroxide, which can be poured into a mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Over time, this mixture absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere, turning back into calcium carbonate as the water evaporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

However, this primitive [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] had drawbacks: molds could not be made very large because CO2 could not penetrate all the material to harden it, and it would not work underwater where there is no CO2 for hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Roman Concrete

The Romans discovered solutions to these problems by adding volcanic ash, called pozzolana, to crushed limestone before heating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This resulted in a much stronger and more durable [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They used it to construct the Pantheon, the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome, which has stood for 2,000 years, and concrete piers that hardened underwater, some still standing today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

The ability of Roman concrete to harden underwater and in thick slabs, impenetrable by CO2, came from the pozzolana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This volcanic ash contains silica, which fundamentally changes the [[chemical_composition_and_properties_of_concrete | chemistry of the cement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. It allowed the concrete to harden without drying, with water becoming an integral part of the hardened material, achieving maximum strength when setting underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Modern Concrete

For centuries, the Roman concrete recipe was lost until its rediscovery in a Swiss monastery book in the 1400s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Modern concrete primarily uses a [[chemical_composition_and_properties_of_concrete | cement formulation]] discovered in the 1840s, known as Portland cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This name is a marketing term, referring to the gray color's resemblance to desirable rocks quarried near Portland, England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Portland cement is made by crushing limestone and mixing it with a percentage of shale or clay to provide silicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This mixture is ground into a fine powder and heated in a kiln to very high temperatures, producing hard nodules called clinker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Though clinker was once considered waste due to its hardness, grinding it down yields a cement far superior to other discovered chemistries, explaining its common use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Tricalcium silicate is the most common compound within Portland cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### The Hardening Process of Modern Concrete

Modern concrete hardens through a process called [[chemical_composition_and_properties_of_concrete | cement hydration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. When water is added to the dry mixture of aggregates and [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] powder, the water dissolves the [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] grains, releasing ions (including calcium hydroxide), making the solution very basic (pH up to 12 or 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. As tricalcium silicate reacts with water, crystals of calcium silicate hydrates and other minerals form and interlock, causing the concrete to harden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Water is essential to this process and becomes part of the solid material; it does not evaporate or dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Thus, freshly poured concrete should be kept in a damp environment to ensure proper curing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Comparing Roman and Modern Concrete

While claims exist that Roman concrete was superior to modern concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, in short, the answer is no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

### Strength and Durability

Modern concrete undergoes rigorous testing to ensure its strength. Concrete suppliers cast sample cylinders of the material at job sites and test them at 7, 14, and 28 days, with full strength typically reached at 28 days, though it continues strengthening after that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Samples are loaded into a hydraulic press until they fail, with the strongest lab-tested concrete exceeding 100,000 psi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Surprisingly, experiments show that pure [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]], [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] with sand, and [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] with sand and gravel (normal concrete mix) break under approximately the same pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This means that reducing [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] content to about 30% in the mix, and adding aggregates, still yields comparable strength characteristics while significantly reducing costs, as [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] is the most expensive part of concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Additionally, adding aggregate helps the sample cohere and stay together under load, as pure [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] tends to flake and chip more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### Roman Concrete's Self-Healing Properties

Roman concrete did possess some surprising advantages. It was less well-mixed than modern concrete, leaving small blocks of undissolved calcium oxide (quicklime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. When cracks formed and water entered, it would dissolve the calcium oxide, forming calcium hydroxide, which then led to new growth of calcium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. This made Roman concrete effectively self-healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

### Cost and Survivor Bias

Despite some unique advantages of Roman concrete, modern concrete is generally preferred due to cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. While very strong and long-lasting concretes *could* be made, they are not chosen because they are more expensive, and buildings are typically not expected to last for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

Furthermore, when evaluating Roman structures, there is a "survivor bias," meaning only the structures that have endured to the present day are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This makes direct comparisons challenging as it doesn't account for Roman concrete structures that may have failed.

## Modern Concrete Production and Challenges

Modern concrete mixtures are precisely controlled. Aggregates are blasted from quarries, ground to specific sizes and shapes, and then weighed into mixer trucks according to a precise recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Consistency is crucial and adjusted with modern chemicals like superplasticizers, which make the concrete easier to work without significantly altering water content and thus strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. A "slump test" or "spread test" is performed to check consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

Concrete typically takes about four hours to harden without agitation, which is why concrete truck drums continuously turn to prevent setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. In emergencies, adding sugary pop like Coke can prevent setting for a few hours due to the sugars interfering with the hydration process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### Environmental Impact

Despite its utility, concrete production has a significant [[environmental_impact_of_cement_and_concrete | environmental impact]], particularly due to CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. An estimated 8% of global CO2 emissions come from concrete, exceeding the entire aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.
Indeed, limestone, the core component of [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] and concrete, originates from the compressed skeletons and shells of ancient sea organisms, making modern skyscrapers literally made of seashells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

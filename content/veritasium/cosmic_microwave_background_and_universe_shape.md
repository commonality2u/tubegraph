Euclid's *Elements*, a foundational mathematics text for over 2,000 years, contained a single sentence, the fifth postulate, that mathematicians found perplexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This postulate, also known as the Parallel Postulate, states that if a straight line falls on two straight lines making interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, will meet on that side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Its complexity, compared to the other simple postulates, led many to suspect it was a mistake and could be proven from the other four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. However, two millennia of attempts to prove it failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Non-Euclidean Geometries

The inability to prove Euclid's fifth postulate eventually led mathematicians to explore what would happen if it were false. This opened the door to "strange new universes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Hyperbolic Geometry
János Bolyai, in the 1820s, realized that the fifth postulate might be independent, meaning it cannot be proven from the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. He imagined a world where more than one parallel line could be drawn through a point not on a given line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This concept requires a curved surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. On such surfaces, the shortest paths between two points, called [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | geodesics]], would appear bent to an external observer, but are straight lines within that geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This geometry is now known as hyperbolic geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

In hyperbolic geometry:
*   The surface is like an infinite crumpling mess, resembling "saddles, on saddles, on saddles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   The Poincare Disk Model represents the entire infinite hyperbolic plane within a finite disc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. In this model, straight lines are arcs of circles that intersect the disc at 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   A key feature is that the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, and the area of an infinitely long triangle is finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Spherical Geometry
Another type of non-Euclidean geometry is spherical geometry, which describes surfaces like a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   On a sphere, straight lines are parts of great circles (e.g., the equator or lines of longitude) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   Any two great circles on a sphere will always intersect at two points, meaning there are no parallel lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   The sum of angles in a triangle on a sphere is always more than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   Initially, spherical geometry was not considered non-Euclidean because lines cannot be extended indefinitely (violating Euclid's second postulate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. However, in 1854, Bernhard Riemann generalized the second postulate from "infinite extension" to "unbounded," making spherical geometry a valid non-Euclidean geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

### Riemann's Generalized Geometry
Riemann further developed the concept of geometry where curvature could differ from place to place and could be extended to three or more dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami proved that hyperbolic and spherical geometries were just as consistent as Euclid's flat geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Geometry and the Universe
The insights from non-Euclidean geometries became crucial for understanding our universe with the advent of Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### General Theory of Relativity and Curved Spacetime
Einstein's theory of general relativity, published in 1915, posits that massive objects curve spacetime, and objects moving through this curved spacetime follow the shortest path, or [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | geodesics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. This means that gravity is not a force but a manifestation of spacetime curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. For example, a space station orbiting Earth is actually traveling in a straight line through curved spacetime, which appears curved to a distant observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. This understanding of straight lines in curved geometries is fundamental to our understanding of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. The theory has been remarkably successful, supported by observations such as gravitational lensing (e.g., a supernova appearing in four different places due to a massive galaxy curving spacetime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, and the detection of gravitational waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

## Measuring the Shape of the Universe

The different behaviors of angles in triangles across the geometries provide a method to determine the overall shape of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Flat geometry**: Angles in a triangle sum to exactly 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Spherical geometry**: Angles in a triangle sum to more than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Hyperbolic geometry**: Angles in a triangle sum to less than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

Carl Friedrich Gauss, around 200 years ago, measured the angles of a large triangle formed by three mountains to determine the Earth's roundness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Some speculate he was attempting to measure the curvature of space itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. His measurements found angles summing to 180 degrees within observational error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. However, a local measurement on Earth would appear flat, just as a small triangle on a balloon appears flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. To observe the universe's overall curvature, a much larger triangle is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

### Using the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
To overcome the scale issue, astronomers measure the angles of "cosmic triangles" by looking back in time to the very first light in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>: the [[Background radiation levels globally | Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.
*   The CMB is a picture from when the universe was only 380,000 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
*   While mostly uniform, the CMB contains slight temperature variations (hotter or colder spots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   These spots originated from quantum fluctuations in the early universe, expanded as the universe grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
*   Astronomers can predict the expected sizes of these spots if the universe were flat, using a "power spectrum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
*   By measuring the apparent size of these spots in the CMB (forming a cosmic triangle with Earth as one vertex), we can infer the universe's curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
    *   If the universe is flat, the measured angle matches predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
    *   If spherical, the measured angle would be larger, shifting the peak left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
    *   If hyperbolic, spots would appear smaller, shifting the peak right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

### Current Best Estimate of Universe Shape
Data from the Planck mission shows that the measured spot sizes in the CMB almost exactly match the predictions for a flat universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. The current best estimate for the curvature of the universe is 0.0007 ± 0.0019, which is effectively zero within the margin of error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. This suggests that the universe we live in is flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

The flatness of the universe is considered serendipitous, as a slightly different average mass-energy density (e.g., just one more hydrogen atom per cubic meter) would result in a spherically curved universe, and one less would result in a hyperbolic geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

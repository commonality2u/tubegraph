Developing durable wheels for space exploration poses significant challenges due to the extreme extraterrestrial environments. NASA has been reinventing the wheel by developing airless tires that can withstand harsh conditions on other planets and for diverse terrestrial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Challenges with Traditional Wheels in Space

Traditional pneumatic tires, like those made of rubber, are unsuitable for space missions. The low or non-existent atmospheric pressure on celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars can cause them to explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Additionally, extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging from 250 degrees Fahrenheit above zero to 250 degrees Fahrenheit below zero on the Moon, cause rubber to become brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. The glass transition temperature of rubber, around 90 degrees Celsius, causes it to shift from flexible to rigid at extreme cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

Hard metal wheels, such as those made of aluminum for the Curiosity rover, have also presented issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. While machined from a single billet to avoid failure points, these wheels must be extremely lightweight to minimize launch costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The Curiosity rover's wheels, with a skin thinner than a credit card (0.7 millimeters thick), have sustained significant damage, including holes and cracks, due to the aggressive terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This damage is a result of forces causing plastic deformation, where the material deforms permanently because the applied stress exceeds its yield strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Ordinary metals can only withstand 0.3% to 0.8% strain elastically before deforming permanently or fracturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

Mesh steel wheels, used on the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), were effective for short distances, like the LRV's farthest journey of 36 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. These "pantograph" wheels, made of woven wires, included internal "bump stops" to limit deformation and prevent plasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. However, for longer missions, plastic deformation would still accumulate over time, leading to degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

## Introduction of Nitinol

To overcome these limitations, NASA has turned to a unique material known as [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | nitinol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Discovered in 1961 at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | nitinol]] is an alloy of nickel and titanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. It possesses extraordinary properties:
*   **Shape Memory Effect**: [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | Nitinol]] can be deformed at cooler temperatures and then return to a predefined "parent" shape when heated. This occurs due to a solid-state phase change between its high-temperature cubic austenite phase and its lower-symmetry martensite phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Superelasticity (Pseudoelasticity)**: Even without temperature change, [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | nitinol]] in its austenite phase can deform up to 8% of its length and still spring back to its original size once the stress is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>. This remarkable property is due to a stress-induced phase change from austenite to detwinned martensite, which is reversible when stress is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. This is significantly more than ordinary metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Energy Conversion**: [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | Nitinol]] converts between mechanical and thermal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. When deformed, it releases heat (exothermic), and when the stress is removed and it returns to shape, it absorbs heat (endothermic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. This elastocaloric effect can be used for heat pumping, similar to a refrigerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.

> "This dissipation potential can act a little bit like the dissipation in the shock absorber... So the tire itself could actually perform some of that dissipation potential on its own." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>
> "So then your tire actually has a potential of becoming a complete suspension system. Which obviously really simplifies building vehicles for space." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>

## Design and Testing of Nitinol Tires

NASA's airless tires are created by weaving [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | nitinol]] springs together into a mesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. The design incorporates a bump stop element that ties into the structure, allowing for load distribution 360 degrees around the tire, significantly increasing load-carrying capacity without adding mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. The manufacturing process is tedious, requiring hundreds of individual spring insertions per tire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>.

Extensive testing of these wheels occurs on a terrain endurance rig, which simulates different surface types found on the Moon (like beach sand) and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. These tests confirm that the [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | nitinol]] alloy is strong enough to support the weight of a vehicle and crew, yet flexible enough to deform up to 8% without permanent damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. These tires are designed to last the entire lifetime of a rover mission, even on rough Martian terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>.

## Terrestrial Applications

Beyond space, [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | nitinol]] airless tires have promising terrestrial applications:
*   **Bicycle Tires**: The technology has been adapted for bicycle tires, which can be driven over beds of nails or even shot with a bullet without loss of performance, making them "bulletproof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Aircraft Tires**: Conventional aircraft tires require very high pressurization (300-400 psi) and frequent maintenance checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>. [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | Nitinol]] tires, being airless, eliminate explosion risks, reduce maintenance, and improve fuel economy by always maintaining optimal shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>.
*   **Vehicle Tires**: Tests on a Jeep have shown that these tires prevent flats and significantly improve fuel economy due to their consistent inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.

The development of [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | nitinol]]-based airless tires represents a significant advancement, offering durable, low-maintenance, and high-performance wheel solutions for both extraterrestrial exploration and everyday use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:00">[23:15:00]</a>.

For a long time, the belief persisted that every object follows a single, well-defined trajectory through space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This intuition, even for someone who has studied physics extensively, is a significant [[Theoretical analyses and misconceptions | misconception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. In reality, everything explores all possible paths simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Optimal Path in Classical Physics

Consider a scenario where you need to reach a friend struggling in water from a beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While a straight line is the shortest distance, running faster on land than swimming in water means the optimal path, minimizing travel time, is a combination of running down the beach and then swimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This behavior is precisely what governs light as it passes from one medium to another, always taking the fastest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The perplexing question in classical physics was how light "knows" which path to take to minimize its journey time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The prevailing classical explanation was that light sets off in one direction, interacts locally with a new medium, changes direction, and happens to end up taking the path of shortest time due to these local rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, this view is incomplete.

## The Quantum Reality: All Paths Explored

The truth is, light does not set out in only one direction; it, along with electrons, protons, and all [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum particles]], truly explores all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The observation of single, well-defined trajectories is, in essence, a profound illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This phenomenon is deeply connected to a fundamental quantity known as [[Principle of least action in classical and quantum mechanics | action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### The Historical Genesis of Action and Quantum Mechanics

The concept of action, initially an ad hoc proposal by Maupertuis as mass times velocity times distance, stated that everything follows the path that minimizes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Hamilton later refined this, defining action as the integral over time of kinetic energy minus potential energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. While useful for solving complex physics problems, action truly became central with the birth of [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

The journey to understanding this began with the "ultraviolet catastrophe" in the late 19th century, where classical physics failed to explain the full spectrum of light emitted by hot objects (blackbody radiation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Max Planck, in a desperate act, proposed that energy could only be emitted in discrete packets, or "quanta," with the energy of a quantum being directly proportional to its frequency ($E=hf$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This introduced a new constant, now known as [[The role of Plancks constant in quantum mechanics | Planck's constant (h)]], which has the units of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Building on Planck's work:
*   **Albert Einstein** in 1905, claimed that light actually comes in discrete packets called photons, each with energy $hf$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Niels Bohr** in 1913, proposed that an electron's angular momentum in an atom is quantized in multiples of Planck's constant over $2\pi$ (h-bar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This explained the stable orbits and discrete spectrum of the hydrogen atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Louis de Broglie** in 1924, had the profound insight that if light could behave as both a wave and a particle, then matter particles could also be waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. He proposed that everything has a wavelength, inversely proportional to its momentum ($Î» = h/p$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. This [[De Broglies hypothesis and waveparticle duality | de Broglie hypothesis]] provided a physical reason for Bohr's quantization: electrons in atoms must exist as standing waves, where a whole number of wavelengths fit around the orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

It is this fundamental wave nature of quantum objects that means they cannot have a single path but must explore all possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## Feynman's Path Integral Formulation

[[Feynmans path integral formulation of quantum mechanics | Richard Feynman]]'s approach to quantum mechanics demonstrates that when a particle goes from one point to another, it has a "chance" to take *any* path, and all these paths must be included in calculations, weighted equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

### The Double Slit Experiment and Infinite Slits

The [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | double-slit experiment]] exemplifies this: since it's impossible to determine which slit a particle went through, quantum mechanics states it must go through both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The probability of detection is found by adding the amplitudes of the waves from each slit and squaring the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

Feynman's insightful thought experiment extends this: what if there were infinite slits on a screen, and then infinite subsequent screens, each with infinite slits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>? This implies that even when particles travel through empty space, they must be exploring all possible paths, as this is how the mathematics would work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. These paths can include "crazy" trajectories, like those faster than light, going back in time, or traveling to the moon and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Constructive and Destructive Interference

In Feynman's model, each possible path has an "arrow" (a complex number representing its amplitude) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. The length of this arrow is weighted the same for all paths, but its direction (phase) changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

The critical insight is that the phase change along a path is directly determined by the classical [[Principle of least action in classical and quantum mechanics | action]] for that path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Specifically, the phase increases as the particle moves along a trajectory, winding a vector around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

Planck's constant (h-bar) is incredibly tiny (approximately $10^{-34}$ joule seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. For macroscopic objects, the action of any path is vastly larger than h-bar. This means the phase of ordinary objects on ordinary paths spins around zillions of times, pointing in a random direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. If a slightly different path is considered, the action changes slightly, causing the phase arrow to spin around many more times, again ending up in a random direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

This leads to:
*   **Destructive Interference:** For most "crazy" paths, the phases change so rapidly that when all the arrows are added up, they cancel each other out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
*   **Constructive Interference:** The only exception is for paths extremely close to the path of [[Principle of least action in classical and quantum mechanics | least action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. Because the action is at a minimum there, tiny changes to the path result in negligible changes to the action (to first order). Thus, the arrows for these paths point in nearly the same direction and constructively interfere, resulting in a large sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

This explains why we only observe the paths of least action in the macroscopic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. It's not that light "knows" where to go, but rather that all other paths destructively interfere, leaving only the path of least action visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

## The Emergence of Classical Mechanics

This process describes how [[Principle of least action in classical and quantum mechanics | classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. A ball follows its trajectory, and planets orbit the sun, not because they have a single precise path, but because for massive particles, their large actions compared to h-bar mean that only paths infinitesimally close to the true path of least action survive due to constructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. This makes them appear much more particle-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. For smaller particles like electrons or photons, their actions are much smaller, leading to a greater spread in the trajectories they take, which is why their wave-like behavior is more apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

## Experimental Demonstration

The concept that light explores all paths can be demonstrated using a diffraction grating, which consists of many tiny strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. When light hits a mirror, it normally reflects such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. This occurs because the "crazy" paths that deviate from this rule destructively interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

However, if parts of the mirror are covered by a diffraction grating (e.g., about a thousand lines per millimeter on foil), it selectively blocks certain "crazy" paths, causing some of the remaining paths to constructively interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. This results in multiple spots of reflected light appearing in places where light should not normally reflect according to classical laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. This "magic foil" physically demonstrates that light is indeed exploring multiple paths, and its usual reflection is due to the cancellation of these alternative paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

## Action in Modern Physics

The principle of least action is a fundamental concept in modern theoretical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. Theoretical physicists often discuss "action" rather than energy or forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. This approach allows for a single mathematical framework (by defining the correct Lagrangian to get the action) to derive the laws of physics across different domains, from classical mechanics to special relativity and electrodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. The "theory of everything" is, in essence, a hunt for the single Lagrangian that can encompass all physical laws in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

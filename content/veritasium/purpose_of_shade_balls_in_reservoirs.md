Shade balls are small, partially water-filled plastic spheres deployed in large numbers on the surface of water reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While commonly believed to primarily reduce evaporation, their main purpose is to prevent the formation of a carcinogenic chemical called Bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The Los Angeles Reservoir, for instance, is covered by 96 million shade balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Bromate Problem

The need for shade balls arose from a scientific discovery related to water disinfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Bromide is a naturally occurring, harmless substance found in water, particularly in areas with some saltwater intrusion like the California Aqueduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Bromide is also almost impossible to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The issue begins when water is disinfected:
*   **Ozone Disinfection:** Around the year 2000, regulations were introduced to limit Bromate formation when Ozone is used to disinfect water, as Bromate is carcinogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Initial measurements at filtration plants using Ozone were within the regulatory limits of 10 micrograms per liter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Chlorine and Sunlight:** Water entering open reservoirs in Los Angeles, which had Bromide from its source and was disinfected with Chlorine, began to form high levels of Bromate when exposed to bright sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This was an "unfortunate scientific discovery" not covered by existing regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Since Bromide and Chlorine were necessary, the only viable choice was to remove the sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Solution Development

Various options were considered to block sunlight:
*   **Floating Tarps:** These were deemed multi-year projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Trampoline-like PVC structures:** These were rejected as they would become "bird perches" and create water quality problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Floating High-Density Polyethylene Pipe:** While HDPE pipe floats, covering a reservoir with it was deemed too hard and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Chipped Pipe Debris:** Creating a "debris field" of chipped pipe was considered, but it raised concerns about creating a "Petri dish" of mushy, warm water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Ultimately, Dr. Bryan White researched and found a product called "bird balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### From "Bird Balls" to Shade Balls
Originally, these balls were used on ponds with mine tailings to prevent waterfowl from being poisoned, and around airports to deter birds from interfering with jet engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Wind tunnel tests had shown their behavior in high winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The deployment of these balls at the LA Reservoir effectively eliminated birds that used to frequent the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

To test their effectiveness against Bromate, three kiddie pools were filled with reservoir water: one in sunlight, one with a tarp, and one with shade balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The shade balls immediately solved the problem by blocking light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | Design and Material Considerations]]
Shade balls are black because the black pigment (carbon black) is essential to block all light from reaching the water, preventing the Bromate reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This pigment also makes the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic stable and durable for at least 10 years when exposed to the elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Other colors tested were unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The material is food-grade and completely inert, posing no harm to drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

The balls are partially filled with water, which makes them heavier and prevents them from blowing away in high winds, such as those at the LA Reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The water also causes them to wobble if they start to roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This internal water makes them significantly harder to push through, especially when they form "close packed crystal-like structures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

> [!INFO] Why spheres?
> While other shapes like hexagonal pieces were considered, spheres are preferred because they do not stack up or perch on the bank of the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This is crucial as the reservoir's water level fluctuates, requiring the balls to spread out to cover the water effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Additional Benefits

Beyond preventing Bromate, shade balls offer significant secondary advantages for water quality and conservation:

*   **Algae Control:** Covering the water surface eliminates sunlight, which in turn eliminates algae growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Previously, Los Angeles used a substantial amount of Chlorine—half of its entire water system's Chlorine—just to control algae in the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. With the shade balls, almost no Chlorine is needed for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_shade_balls_on_evaporation_and_water_quality | Evaporation Reduction]]:** Despite being black, shade balls significantly reduce evaporation by 80 to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This is due to several factors:
    *   **Reduced Surface Area:** They decrease the exposed surface area of water where molecules can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   **Reduced Airflow:** They prevent air from continuously removing the moist layer above the water and replacing it with dryer air, which would otherwise increase evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   **Thermal Insulation:** While the top of the black balls gets hotter, the bottom remains cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The air contained within the balls acts as a good thermal insulator, preventing much heat transfer to the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Measurements have shown that the water under the shade balls is actually cooler than in an open reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This [[the_science_behind_shade_balls | cooling effect]] further reduces evaporation.

## Cost and [[logistics_of_handling_and_distributing_shade_balls | Logistics]]

Shade balls cost around 33-34 cents per piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. They have a salvage value as they are recyclable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Over their lifespan, the savings from reduced chlorination and evaporation are estimated to pay for at least half the cost of the balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The water quality benefit, particularly preventing Bromate formation, is considered immeasurable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Navigating a boat through the shade balls is described as very difficult, akin to driving through peanut butter due to their density and the way they form crystal-like structures that resist movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Despite breezes, a boat floating on the balls remains stable, unlike in an open lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

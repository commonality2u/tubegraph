The Ames window illusion is an optical phenomenon that demonstrates how the brain interprets visual information, often prioritizing learned assumptions over actual sensory input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Despite an object rotating continuously, it appears to oscillate back and forth, or even pass through other objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

## Core Phenomenon

When observing the Ames window, most people perceive it as oscillating back and forth, stopping, and reversing direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. However, the window is actually on a turntable and rotating continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This illusion persists even when the observer knows the true continuous rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Mechanics of the Illusion

### Physical Design

The "window" itself is not a true rectangle, but a trapezoid, with one side significantly shorter than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This trapezoidal shape is essential to the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. The card is also shaded to create the appearance of three dimensions, though it is actually a two-dimensional card with the same image on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Optimal lighting, evenly distributed on both sides, is crucial to convince the viewer of its oscillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

### Brain's Interpretation: The Carpentered Environment Hypothesis

The illusion was created by Adelbert Ames in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Ames believed the key to the illusion lies in our everyday experience of living in a "carpentered environment," filled with rectangular objects and 90-degree angles like houses, rooms, doors, windows, tables, and chairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Although the images formed on our retinas from such objects are typically trapezoids, our brains, from extensive experience, assume they should be rectangles with right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This assumption leads our brains to infer depth information, which is usually correct in our rectilinear world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. However, when presented with a trapezoidal window that the brain assumes to be rectangular, this inference leads to the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

The illusion occurs because when the larger side of the trapezoid moves around to the back, it still appears larger in our field of view than the small side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. Our brain perceives this larger side as closer, causing it to misinterpret the direction of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. Thus, half the time we see the window as it truly is, and half the time we see the bigger side as closer, even though it's farther away, resulting in the appearance of oscillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

### Role of Anamorphosis

Both the Ames window and the de Heer circle (which also appears to oscillate when continuously rotating) utilize a technique called anamorphosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Anamorphosis involves creating a distorted projection of an object, which only appears in its proper proportions when viewed from a specific position or with a particular device, often a mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. This technique has been employed by artists for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **The Ambassadors (1533) by Hans Holbein the Younger:** Features a distorted human skull on the floor that becomes clear only when viewed from the top right or bottom left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **Leonardo's Eye by Leonardo da Vinci:** Takes its proper form when viewed from the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
*   **Lascaux Cave Paintings (17,000 years ago):** Some argue these show early examples of anamorphic art due to artists considering perception from different vantage points on uneven surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

Anamorphosis is also central to Ames's more famous illusion, the [[creation_and_implications_of_ames_room_illusion | Ames Room]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

## Experimental Demonstrations

The illusion can be further demonstrated by adding objects to the window:
*   **Rubik's Cube:** Attaching a Rubik's Cube to the short side of the trapezoid reveals that the cube appears to continue rotating normally, while the window itself still oscillates or even seems to detach from the cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Ruler through the Window:** Placing a ruler through the middle of the window leads the brain to perceive the ruler as passing *through* the solid window, even though this is physically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This highlights the brain's preference for the illusion over continuous rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## Susceptibility to the Illusion

### Cultural and Environmental Factors

In 1957, Harvard psychologists tested the Ames window illusion on 80 South African children aged 10-14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Forty children from urban Durban, accustomed to rectangular buildings, showed 60% reporting the window oscillating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. In contrast, only 17.5% of the 40 children from rural communities, who lived in round huts with few 90-degree angles, reported the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. This supports the carpentered environment hypothesis, suggesting that less experience with rectangles leads to less susceptibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

However, when subjects were seated 20 feet away with one eye closed, the illusion became far more convincing, with 90% of all participants seeing oscillation and no significant difference between urban and rural groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. This indicates that factors beyond rectangular exposure, such as depth cues (binocular vision provides more depth information), also play a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### Developmental Factors

The ability to interpret depth cues appears to be an innate ability that develops very early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. Studies with babies aged five and a half, seven and a half, and nine months showed that while five-and-a-half-month-olds had no special preference for the Ames window, seven-and-a-half and nine-month-olds were significantly more interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. This suggests older babies perceive it as doing something different, presumably oscillating, due to their preference for novelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The Ames window illusion highlights a fundamental aspect of perception: our brains are constantly faced with ambiguity and must decide which of infinite possibilities represents external reality, often below the level of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. This challenges the idea that perceptions transparently represent external reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

This concept extends beyond optical illusions, confronting the misconception in science that competing theories can always be resolved by simply looking at the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. In many circumstances, the same data can arise from very different external realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   The debate over whether the sun revolves around the Earth or the Earth rotates on its axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.
*   In quantum mechanics, whether a wave function collapses or the universe branches upon measurement (see [[manyworlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
*   Whether the speed of light is truly the same in all directions, or if only the roundtrip speed is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

These examples illustrate that currently, data may not discriminate between certain theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. The Ames illusions serve as a metaphor for life, reminding us that even simple visual information can spectacularly fool our brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>. This suggests that when interpreting information and forming conclusions about reality, a degree of humility and less certainty is warranted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.

## Creation of a Large-Scale Ames Window

The presenter developed an obsession with recreating the Ames window illusion, making numerous small and then larger versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. The goal was to create a window large enough for a person to pass through, similar to the ruler demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. The resulting window needed to be at least eight feet on its longest dimension and was constructed from six pieces of plywood, glued and screwed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. A key challenge was making it appear two-dimensional by beveling the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. The large window was hung by metal cables that allowed it to twist, enabling the presenter to jump into the window and let it unwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

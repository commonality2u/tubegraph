Compliant mechanisms have found a critical application in the safety of nuclear weapons. Professor Larry Howell developed a mechanism specifically designed to prevent [[nuclear_weapons_detection | nuclear weapons]] from accidentally detonating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Purpose and Function
The device serves in the "safing and arming" of [[nuclear_weapons_detection | nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Its primary objective is to ensure that the weapon does not accidentally discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Specifically, it prevents random vibrations, such as those caused by an earthquake, from inadvertently disabling safety protocols and arming the nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

The mechanism operates with high precision:
*   A rotor wheel within the device makes two complete revolutions per second when operating at 72 Hertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   An arming laser shines on this rotor wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   When proper inputs are given to the system, the wheel rotates a notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   If all necessary inputs are provided, a hole on the rotor aligns with the laser beam, initiating further processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

It is crucial for this device to maintain perfectly predictable performance, even after decades of disuse in a silo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Advantages of Compliant Mechanisms
Compliant mechanisms are uniquely suited for this sensitive task due to several key advantages:

*   **Reduced Part Count**: Compliant mechanisms integrate the functions of hinges, bearings, and springs into single, bendable components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This simplifies the design and reduces the number of separate pieces.
*   **Precision**: Despite their flexible nature, compliant mechanisms can produce very precise motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Elimination of Backlash**: Unlike traditional hinges (a pin in a hole), compliant mechanisms do not suffer from backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Backlash occurs when there's a delay in motion reversal due to "give" in the hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The absence of backlash contributes to better performance and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **No Wear or Lubrication Needed**: Since they avoid the pin-in-hole design of traditional hinges, compliant mechanisms do not experience wear and do not require lubrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This ensures consistent operation over long periods, vital for devices that might sit unused for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Miniaturization**: The design simplicity allows for significantly smaller proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, leveraging production processes like photolithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The requirement for the nuclear weapons device was to be as small as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Traditional methods, including those used by Swiss watch manufacturers, could not achieve the necessary miniaturization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Material Versatility**: Compliant mechanisms can be made from robust materials. The nuclear weapons safety device was produced from hardened stainless steel, with some components as small as a human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This is notable given that initial research for compliant mechanisms involved brittle materials like silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Current Status
While prototypes of the device were designed and tested, information regarding their actual deployment in [[nuclear_weapons_detection | nuclear weapons]] is classified. The developers are not informed of what happens to the devices once they go "behind the fence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

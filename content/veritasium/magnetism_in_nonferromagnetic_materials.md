Despite common perception, all materials possess magnetic properties, though these are often only discernible in the presence of strong [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic fields]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. The [[worlds_strongest_magnet | world's strongest magnet]], located at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida, demonstrates these effects on various substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Effects on Electronic Equipment
Strong [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic fields]] can significantly disrupt electronic devices. For instance, camera equipment, especially those with CMOS sensors, can experience issues like redirected electrons, leading to distorted video or audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Behavior of Non-Ferromagnetic Materials
When non-ferromagnetic materials are placed in a strong [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic field]], they exhibit surprising behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Eddy Currents and Lenz's Law
Materials that conduct electricity, such as copper and aluminum, behave differently when moving through a [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic field]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
When a metal plate falls through a [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic field]], the changing number of magnetic field lines passing through it induces electric currents, known as eddy currents, within the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. These eddy currents generate their own [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic field]] that opposes the original change in flux, a phenomenon known as Lenz's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This means if a plate falls towards a north magnetic pole, the induced currents create a repelling north magnetic pole, significantly slowing its descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Eddy currents dissipate energy, primarily as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This is evident as a metal plate warms up while falling through a strong field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. An electromagnetic levitator observed at the Palace of Discovery in Paris demonstrates this principle, where alternating current induces eddy currents that generate enough heat to boil water on a levitated plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Lenz's Law acts as a "No You Don't" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>:
*   If a plate falls, eddy currents induce a force to slow it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   If one tries to lift the plate, a south magnetic pole is induced, attracting it back to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   Attempting to push the plate down rapidly also increases the rate of flux change, inducing stronger opposing currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   Conductive objects like aluminum cylinders refuse to roll across a strong [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic field]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   An aluminum foil-wrapped volleyball passed over or dropped into the field also experiences deceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Potato cannon projectiles made of conductive materials, when fired across a strong [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic field]], show significant deceleration and rotation, remaining oriented along the magnetic field lines to minimize flux change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Projectiles containing wire coils connected to LEDs illuminate as they cross the field, demonstrating the induced currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Superconductors
[[Superconducting and resistive magnets | Superconductors]] below their critical temperature exhibit zero electrical resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. When a magnet is brought near, currents are induced to oppose the change in flux. Because they are superconductors, these currents persist indefinitely and expel all [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic field]] from their interior, causing levitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. However, some filaments within the material are not superconducting and can trap magnetic field lines, locking the object in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

A "human levitator" demonstrates this effect, with a magnet hovering above a ring of superconductors. When a person stands on the magnet, the increase in magnetic flux is opposed by currents in the superconductors, creating a repulsive magnetic field that causes the person to levitate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### Paramagnetism
Some materials are consistently attracted to [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic fields]], a property known as paramagnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Liquid oxygen is an example; it is attracted to a magnet regardless of its pole, as the external field strengthens the material's internal [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic field]], causing attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

### Diamagnetism
Most materials are repelled by sufficiently strong [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic fields]], a property called diamagnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Water is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. In a strong external field, water molecules effectively become opposing magnets and are repelled, creating an indent on the water's surface when a magnet is brought close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

This repulsion allows for the levitation of objects not typically considered magnetic in strong enough [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic fields]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Examples include:
*   Strawberries, due to their high water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   Raspberries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   Small pieces of plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   Living organisms, which contain significant amounts of water, such as frogs, grasshoppers, and mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Experiments with levitating mice aim to understand the effects of weightlessness without going into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

While there are no lasting effects, strong [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic fields]] can temporarily polarize stones in the inner ear of rodents, causing them to spin in circles for a few minutes after exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

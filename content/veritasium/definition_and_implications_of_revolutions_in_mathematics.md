The definition and implications of "revolutions" in mathematics and physics are explored through a notorious SAT question from 1982 that almost everyone, including the test writers, answered incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This question highlighted the ambiguity of common terms and revealed deeper mathematical principles and astronomical phenomena.

## The Infamous 1982 SAT Question 17

In 1982, a specific SAT math question stumped every single student who took the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The question stated:
<blockquote>"In the figure above, the radius of circle A is 1/3 the radius of circle B. Starting from the position shown in the figure, circle A rolls around circle B. At the end of how many revolutions of circle A will the center of the circle first reach its starting point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a></blockquote>
The given options were A, 3/2; B, three; C, six; D, 9/2; or E, nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Initially, many, including the video's presenter, assumed the answer was three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This intuition stems from the fact that if the radius of Circle B is three times that of Circle A, its circumference would also be three times larger, leading to the expectation of three rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. However, this answer, along with all other options, was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. The test writers themselves believed the answer was three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

Three students—Shivan Kartha, Bruce Taub, and Doug Jungreis—independently identified and reported the error to the College Board, the SAT administrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. They confidently stated that the College Board was wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Weeks later, the College Board publicly admitted their mistake and nullified the question for all test takers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

## The Coin Rotation Paradox

The core of the SAT question's challenge lies in the **coin rotation paradox**. This paradox is best illustrated with two identical coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. If one coin rolls around another identical coin, intuition suggests it should rotate once, as their circumferences are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. However, a demonstration shows that the coin rotates twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Even when the coins are the same size, the rolling coin performs an extra rotation due to the circular path it travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

Applying this paradox to SAT Question 17, where Circle A's radius is 1/3 of Circle B's, the expectation of three rotations is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. When demonstrated with a physical model, Circle A actually rotates four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This is one more rotation than initially expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

The general solution for a circle rolling around another circle is to calculate the ratio of the circumferences (or radii) and add one to account for the circular path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. In this case, the ratio of Circle B's circumference to Circle A's is 3:1, so 3 + 1 = 4 rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This extra rotation occurs because Circle A is rolling the length of Circle B's circumference *while also* going around Circle B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

## Mathematical Proof: Rolling Without Slipping

A formal proof for this phenomenon relies on the principle that if a circle rolls without slipping on any surface, the total distance traveled by its center is equal to the total amount the circle has rotated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. This principle is always true, whether the surface is a polygon or a blob, or if the circle is rolling on the outside or inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

To find the number of rotations, one simply needs to find the distance traveled by the center of the rolling circle and divide it by the circle's own circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

*   **Rolling along a flat line**: The distance traveled by the center is equal to the length of the line. Divided by the circle's circumference, this gives the expected number of rotations (N) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
*   **Rolling continuously around a shape (exterior)**: The circle's center travels the perimeter of the shape *plus* one circumference of the rolling circle. When divided by the rolling circle's circumference, this yields N + 1 rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. This explains the "extra" rotation in the coin paradox and SAT question.
*   **Rolling continuously within a shape (interior)**: The circle's center travels the perimeter of the shape *minus* one circumference of the rolling circle, resulting in N - 1 rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

## Ambiguity of "Revolution"

The problem's wording also introduced another layer of ambiguity. If "revolution" is interpreted by its precise astronomical definition, it means a complete orbit around another body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. For example, the Earth revolves around the Sun, distinct from its rotation on its axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. By this definition, Circle A would only "revolve" around Circle B once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. However, other definitions of revolution can include an object rotating about its own axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. The question's extreme ambiguity allowed for at least three different justifiable solutions: one, three, or four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

## Implications in Astronomy: Sidereal vs. Solar Time

This principle of "extra rotation" extends significantly into astronomy, influencing timekeeping and observations.

### Sidereal Year vs. Solar Year

When we say there are 365.24 days in a year, we are counting the Earth's rotations from our perspective on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. However, to an external observer (e.g., relative to distant stars), the Earth performs one extra rotation due to its circular path around the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

*   **Solar Year**: The time it takes for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky as observed from Earth (approximately 365.24 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. This is based on the perspective of the Earth's surface relative to the Sun.
*   **Sidereal Year**: The time it takes for the Earth to complete one orbit relative to the fixed stars (approximately 366.24 rotations from an external perspective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

### Sidereal Day vs. Solar Day

This difference also manifests in daily timekeeping:

*   **Solar Day**: The time it takes for the Sun to be directly above you again on Earth, approximately 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. During this period, Earth must rotate slightly more than 360 degrees to compensate for its orbital movement around the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.
*   **Sidereal Day**: The time it takes for a distant star to be directly overhead again, meaning Earth has rotated exactly 360 degrees on its axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. This is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

The cumulative difference between these two types of days accounts for the "extra" day in the Sidereal year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

### Practical Applications

*   **Solar time** is used for daily life on Earth because it aligns with the cycle of day and night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.
*   **Sidereal time** is essential for astronomers, as it allows telescopes to track the same region of space each night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. Geostationary satellites also use Sidereal time to maintain their orbits locked with Earth's rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

The coin paradox, originating from a simple geometry problem, thus provides a fundamental understanding of how we track time on Earth versus in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

The search for [[history_of_perfect_numbers | perfect numbers]] and the quest to understand their properties is an ancient mathematical problem, dating back 2000 years, and considered by some to be the oldest unsolved problem in math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It has captivated mathematicians for centuries due to its age, simplicity, and inherent beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Defining Perfect Numbers

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. For example, the number 6 has proper divisors 1, 2, and 3. When these are added (1 + 2 + 3), the sum is 6, making it a perfect number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. In contrast, 10 is not perfect because its proper divisors (1, 2, 5) sum to 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.

Between 1 and 100, only 6 and 28 are perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>. Extending the search to 10,000 reveals two more: 496 and 8,128 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>. These four numbers were the only perfect numbers known to the ancient Greeks and for over a thousand years thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>.

## Ancient Greek Contributions

### Euclid (circa 300 BC)
Around 300 BC, Euclid discovered a pattern for generating even perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. His formula states that if `(2^P - 1)` is a prime number, then `2^(P-1) * (2^P - 1)` will yield a perfect number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   For P=2, (2^2 - 1) = 3 (prime). 2^(2-1) * 3 = 2 * 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   For P=3, (2^3 - 1) = 7 (prime). 2^(3-1) * 7 = 4 * 7 = 28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   For P=5, (2^5 - 1) = 31 (prime). 2^(5-1) * 31 = 16 * 31 = 496 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Since the formula involves multiplying by `2^(P-1)` (an even number), it always produces an even number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. While Euclid found a way to generate even perfect numbers, he did not prove that this was the *only* way, leaving open the possibility of odd perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Nicomachus (circa 1st Century AD)
Four centuries after Euclid, the Greek philosopher Nicomachus published *Introductio Arithmetica*, a standard arithmetic text for the next thousand years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. In it, he stated five conjectures about perfect numbers without providing proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>:
1.  The nth perfect number has n digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
2.  All perfect numbers are even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
3.  All perfect numbers end in 6 and 8 alternately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
4.  Euclid's algorithm produces every even perfect number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
5.  There are infinitely many perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

For a millennium, these conjectures were considered facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Medieval Contributions

### Ibn Fallus (13th Century AD)
In the 13th century, Egyptian mathematician Ibn Fallus published a list of 10 perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. While three turned out to be incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, his list included accurate ones that disproved Nicomachus's conjectures:
*   The fifth perfect number being eight digits long disproved Nicomachus's first conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Both the fifth and sixth perfect numbers ending in 6 disproved Nicomachus's third conjecture about alternating endings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## [[contributions_of_renaissance_mathematicians | Renaissance Mathematicians]]

The problem reached [[contributions_of_renaissance_mathematicians | Renaissance Europe]] two centuries later, where the fifth, sixth, and seventh perfect numbers were rediscovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. All discovered perfect numbers still conformed to Euclid's form, emphasizing the importance of finding values of P for which `(2^P - 1)` is prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Marin Mersenne (17th Century)
French polymath Marin Mersenne extensively studied numbers of the form `(2^P - 1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. In 1644, he published a list of 11 values of P for which he claimed `(2^P - 1)` would be prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Numbers of this form that are prime are now called [[significance_of_mersenne_primes | Mersenne Primes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The first seven exponents on his list correctly resulted in primes, corresponding to the first seven perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Mersenne admitted that he did not check all the larger numbers on his list, such as `2^67 - 1`, due to the immense time required for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### Pierre de Fermat and Rene Descartes
Mersenne discussed the problem of perfect numbers with contemporaries like Pierre de Fermat and Rene Descartes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. In 1638, Descartes conjectured that there are no even perfect numbers except those of Euclid's form, and also that if an odd perfect number exists, it must have a special structure: the product of a prime and the square of a different number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. However, Descartes was unable to prove either statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## 18th Century Breakthroughs: Leonhard Euler

Leonhard Euler, introduced to Fermat's work by Christian Goldbach, became deeply involved in number theory, including the problem of perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. He picked up where Descartes left off, achieving three significant breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>:

1.  **Discovery of the Eighth Perfect Number**: In 1732, Euler discovered the eighth perfect number by verifying that `2^31 - 1` is prime, as Mersenne had predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
2.  **The Sigma Function and Euclid-Euler Theorem**: Euler invented the sigma function (σ(n)), which sums all divisors of a number, including the number itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. For perfect numbers, σ(n) = 2n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Using this function, Euler proved that every even perfect number *must* have Euclid's form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem and solved a 1600-year-old problem, proving Nicomachus's fourth conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
3.  **Form of Odd Perfect Numbers**: Euler also sought to prove Descartes's statement about the structure of odd perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Using the sigma function and properties of prime powers, he demonstrated that if an odd perfect number `n` exists, it must have exactly one prime factor raised to an odd power, while all other prime factors must be raised to an even power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This means an odd perfect number must be of the form `p^k * m^2`, where `p` is a prime number and `k` is an odd integer, and `m` is an integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Despite this, Euler could not prove their existence, calling it "a most difficult question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## 19th and 20th Century Discoveries

For 150 years after Euler, little progress was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. English mathematician Peter Barlow pessimistically wrote that Euler's eighth perfect number "is the greatest that ever will be discovered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

### Edouard Lucas (19th Century)
Despite Barlow's prediction, mathematicians continued their pursuit. Edouard Lucas proved in 1876 that `2^67 - 1` (a number on Mersenne's list) was not prime, though he could not find its factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

### Frank Nelson Cole (early 20th Century)
In 1903, 27 years after Lucas's finding, Frank Nelson Cole famously gave a talk where he walked to a blackboard and wrote down `2^67 - 1`, then on the other side, he multiplied `193,707,721 * 761,838,257,287`, showing the product was `2^67 - 1`. He sat down without a word, and the audience erupted in applause. Cole later admitted it took him three years of working on Sundays to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. A modern computer can do this in less than a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

### Raphael Robinson (Mid-20th Century)
From 500 BC until 1952, only 12 [[significance_of_mersenne_primes | Mersenne primes]] and thus 12 perfect numbers had been discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. The primary challenge was verifying the primality of large Mersenne numbers. In 1952, American mathematician Raphael Robinson wrote a computer program to perform this task on the fastest computer at the time, the SWAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Within 10 months, he found the next five [[significance_of_mersenne_primes | Mersenne primes]] and their corresponding perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Modern Era and Collaborative Computing

The rate of discovery of [[significance_of_mersenne_primes | Mersenne primes]] increased rapidly with the advent of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

### George Woltman and GIMPS (Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search)
As [[significance_of_mersenne_primes | Mersenne primes]] grew astronomically large, finding them became increasingly difficult even for supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. In 1996, computer scientist George Woltman launched the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. GIMPS distributes the computational work across many volunteer computers, allowing anyone to contribute to the search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. This project has been highly successful, discovering 17 new [[significance_of_mersenne_primes | Mersenne primes]], 15 of which were the largest known primes at the time of their discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. There is even a $250,000 prize for the first billion-digit prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### John Pace (21st Century)
In 2017, Church Deacon John Pace discovered the 50th [[significance_of_mersenne_primes | Mersenne Prime]] using GIMPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This number, `2^77,232,917 - 1`, is more than 23 million digits long and was the largest known prime at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. A year later, the 51st [[significance_of_mersenne_primes | Mersenne Prime]], `2^82,589,933 - 1`, with over 24 million digits, was discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. As of today, this remains the largest known prime, and generally, the largest [[significance_of_mersenne_primes | Mersenne Prime]] is also the largest known prime due to their rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

## Current Status and Conjectures about Perfect Numbers

While computers have been incredibly successful in finding even perfect numbers, only 51 have been discovered so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. The Lenstra and Pomerance Wagstaff conjecture predicts that there are infinitely many [[significance_of_mersenne_primes | Mersenne primes]] and, consequently, infinitely many even perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. The difficulty lies in their extreme rarity and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. However, this remains a conjecture, not a proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

The most pressing open problem regarding perfect numbers remains: "Do any [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect numbers]] exist?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

### [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | Methods and challenges in discovering new perfect numbers]]: The Search for Odd Perfect Numbers

Researchers have attempted to find [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect numbers]] by checking vast ranges of numbers.
*   In 1991, using a "factor chain" algorithm, researchers showed that if an [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect number]] exists, it must be larger than 10^300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   In 2012, Pascal Ochem and Michael Rao raised this lower bound to 10^1500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.
*   Recent progress has pushed the bound even higher, to 10^2200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

This implies that a direct computer search is unlikely to yield an [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect number]] anytime soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

One approach involves defining more conditions that an [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect number]] would have to satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. For instance, it is now known that an [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect number]] must have at least 10 prime factors and thousands of non-distinct prime factors, and be larger than 10^3000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. The hope is that the accumulation of so many stringent conditions will eventually prove their non-existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

### Spoof Numbers
Another path to understanding [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect numbers]] involves "spoof" numbers. A spoof is a number that is very close to being an [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect number]] but ultimately fails a primality test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Descartes himself found an example that would be perfect if one of its factors was prime, but it was not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | Odd perfect numbers]] would share all properties of spoofs, plus additional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. The goal is to find properties of spoofs that prevent them from being [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. For example, if spoofs must be divisible by 105, and [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect numbers]] cannot be divisible by 105, this would prove non-existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. In 2022, Pace Nielsen and a BYU team found 21 spoof numbers but did not find properties that rule out [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

### Carl Pomerance and Heuristic Arguments
Mathematician Carl Pomerance put forward a heuristic argument (not a proof) that predicts no [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect numbers]] exist beyond the current search bounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. His argument, based on how frequently primes of certain types occur, suggests there should be "no more than 10^-540 perfect numbers" of a specific form between 10^2200 and infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. While compelling, this heuristic also suggests there should be no large even perfect numbers, which contradicts the expectation of infinitely many even perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. Thus, it is not a definitive proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

## Conclusion

The problem of perfect numbers, especially the existence of [[current_status_and_conjectures_about_odd_perfect_numbers | odd perfect numbers]], remains one of the oldest unsolved problems in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Despite the lack of direct real-world applications for perfect numbers themselves, the pursuit of such fundamental mathematical curiosities has historically led to unforeseen and profound advancements, as seen with [[the prime number phenomenon | number theory]]'s role in cryptography and non-Euclidean geometries in general relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. The continuous effort to solve these problems fosters new ideas and methods, driving the field of mathematics forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

The concept of "learning styles" suggests that individuals have a preferred way of learning, and if information is presented in accordance with this style, they will learn better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This idea is widely accepted in education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Common Learning Styles (VARK)

While dozens of learning style theories exist, the most common one identifies four main styles, known as VARK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>:
*   **Visual learners** learn best from images, demonstrations, and pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Auditory learners** learn best from listening to an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Reading-writing learners** learn best from reading and writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Kinesthetic learners** learn best by doing and physically interacting with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Intuitive Appeal

The idea of learning styles makes intuitive sense because people recognize that everyone is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Some individuals may have better spatial reasoning, listening comprehension, or manual dexterity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This aligns with a broader Western tradition emphasizing individual uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Teachers also widely believe in learning styles; a survey of nearly 400 teachers from the UK and the Netherlands found that over 90% believed individuals learn better when information is received in their preferred style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Testing the Hypothesis

To test the learning styles hypothesis, a randomized control trial could be conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This involves:
1.  Identifying learners with different styles (e.g., visual and auditory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
2.  Randomly assigning them to different educational presentations (e.g., visual and auditory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
3.  Giving everyone the same test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

If the hypothesis were true, performance should be better when the presentation matches the learning style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Experimental Evidence
*   **Anecdotal Street Experiment**: An informal experiment showed that most people remembered around five or six items presented visually or auditorily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Those who remembered substantially more (eight or nine items) did so not because of their "learning style" but because they employed [[memory_strategies | memory strategies]], such as creating an order, repeating lists, or forming a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Rigorous Studies**: Studies, including one that compared visualizers and verbalizers learning about electronics, consistently found that students whose preferred learning style matched their instruction performed no better on tests than those whose instruction was mismatched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This result was replicated with non-college-educated adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Adherence to Preferred Styles
A 2018 study at an Indiana university found that an overwhelming majority of students used study strategies supposedly incompatible with their classified VARK learning style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The minority who did align their strategies with their style did not perform significantly differently on assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Origin of VARK

The VARK model was developed by Neil Fleming, a school inspector in New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. He created it based on observations of teachers and a desire to explain why some teachers reached learners while others didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Fleming stated that preferred modes of learning seemed to hold "some magic, some explanatory power," leading to VARK's creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. There was no study demonstrating that students naturally cluster into four distinct groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Why the Myth Persists

While some people are more skilled at interpreting specific stimuli (e.g., a person with perfect pitch for music, or someone with excellent visual-spatial reasoning for maps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, the claim of learning style theories is that these preferences are consistent across *all* learning domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This is clearly not the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Most people learn geography better with a map, regardless of their supposed "style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

The reason differences in learning or recall aren't seen with different presentations is that what is recalled is typically the *meaning* behind the presentation, not the precise nature of the images or sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Review articles consistently conclude there is no credible evidence that learning styles exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Researchers in a 2009 review noted the "striking and disturbing" contrast between the popularity of the learning styles approach and the lack of credible evidence for its utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

The belief in learning styles often stems from [[Confirmation bias and its impact | confirmation bias]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. If someone believes they are a visual learner, and a diagram helps them understand a concept, they interpret this as evidence for their visual learning style, rather than recognizing that the diagram itself might simply be an effective learning tool for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## What Actually Improves Learning

There is a large body of literature supporting the claim that everyone learns better with [[multimodal_learning | multimodal approaches]] where words and pictures are presented together, rather than words or pictures alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This is known as the multimedia effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Ultimately, the most important factor for learning is not the way information is presented, but what is happening inside the learner's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. People learn best when they are actively thinking about the material, solving problems, or imagining scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Many evidence-based teaching methods improve learning, but learning styles is not one of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## Consequences of the Myth

The prevalence of the learning styles misconception likely makes learning worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>:
*   It gives teachers unnecessary things to worry about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   It can make some students reluctant to engage with certain types of instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   Time and money spent on learning styles training could be better invested in interventions that actually improve learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

Individuals are not exclusively visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learners; they are all these kinds of learners in one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The best learning experiences involve multiple different ways of understanding the same thing, a strategy that works for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Critical Information Consumption

The widespread belief in learning styles despite a lack of evidence highlights the importance of [[critical_thinking_in_education | critical thinking in education]] and information literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. A common pitfall is searching only for information that confirms existing beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. To avoid this, it's advisable to try different search queries, including terms like "debunked" or "false," to find diverse perspectives and assess information reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

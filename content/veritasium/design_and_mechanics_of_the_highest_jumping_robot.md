This article details the design and mechanics of a tiny robot that holds the world record for jumping, highlighting the innovations that allow it to achieve unprecedented heights.

## Record-Breaking Performance

Weighing less than a tennis ball (approximately 30 grams), this robot can jump 31 meters high, which is higher than a 10-story building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This significantly surpasses the previous record of 3.7 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In terms of relative height, it could jump from the Statue of Liberty's feet to eye level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## [[criteria_and_mechanisms_of_jumping | Criteria and Mechanisms of Jumping]]

For an action to be considered a jump, it must meet two [[criteria_and_mechanisms_of_jumping | criteria]]:
1.  Motion must be generated by pushing off the ground, excluding mechanisms like quad-copters that push off the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  No mass can be lost during the process, differentiating it from rockets ejecting fuel or arrows launched from a bow (the bow would need to remain with the arrow for it to count as a jump) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## [[comparison_between_biological_and_engineered_jumpers | Comparison with Biological Jumpers]]

Many animals, from sand fleas to kangaroos, jump by launching their bodies with a single stroke of their muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The height of the jump is determined by the energy delivered in that single stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The Galago (Bush baby) is considered the best jumper in the animal kingdom, with 30% of its muscle mass dedicated to jumping, allowing it to leap over two meters from a standstill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Their superior jumping ability comes from having more muscle, not better muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Elastic jumpers, including toys and this robot, operate on the principle of storing energy in a spring and then releasing it in a single stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Design and Mechanics

This robot's exceptional height is attributed to three key design features:

### 1. Incredibly Lightweight Design
The robot weighs only 30 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This is achieved through:
*   A tiny motor and battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   A structure made entirely of lightweight carbon fiber and rubber, which also doubles as the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Natural latex rubber, chosen for its ability to store more energy per unit mass (7,000 joules per kilogram) than almost any other elastic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This highlights advanced [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | material science in robotic engineering]].

### 2. Optimized Spring Design
The main structure comprises four carbon fiber pieces bound by elastic bands, forming the spring that stores energy for the jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

The design of the spring is crucial:
*   **Initial experiments:** Designs using only rubber bands with hinged aluminum rods showed force decreasing after a peak during compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Designs with only carbon fiber slats required significant initial force that increased linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Design:** The ultimate design is a hybrid of these approaches, resulting in a force profile that is almost flat over the entire compression range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This provides double the energy storage of a typical spring where force is proportional to displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Researchers consider this the most efficient spring ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This optimized spring design is a key aspect of [[design_and_production_of_compliant_mechanisms | compliant mechanisms]].
*   **Mass Distribution:** Counterintuitively, adding a chunk of steel to the top of the jumper can make it jump higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This is because the body (the moving part) needs to weigh at least as much as the foot for efficient energy transfer during the collision with the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### 3. Work Multiplication

This is the "real secret" to the robot's extreme height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Unlike animals that jump with a single muscle stroke, engineered jumpers can store energy from many strokes or motor revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

*   **Mechanism:** A small motor winds up a string connected to the bottom of the robot, compressing the structure and storing energy in the carbon fiber and rubber bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The compression reaches its maximum after about 90 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Energy Release:** A latch holds the string under tension, preventing the spring from unspooling until the robot is fully compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. When triggered, the latch releases, unspooling the string and releasing the stored energy all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This allows the robot to go from standstill to over 100 kilometers per hour in just nine milliseconds, generating an acceleration of over 300 g's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Small Motor, High Energy:** The motor can be small because it doesn't need to deliver energy all at once; it gradually builds it up over minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This is a trade-off of time for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **[[comparison_between_biological_and_engineered_jumpers | Biological vs. Engineered Work Multiplication]]:** While some biological organisms, like the sand flea, use internal latches to store and release energy quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, no organism has developed work multiplication for a jump from a standstill internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, external examples exist, such as spider monkeys pulling back a branch hand-over-hand or slingshot spiders pulling back a silky string multiple times to catapult themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Previously, engineered jumping focused on mimicking biological jumping, but work multiplication provides a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. By generating a large energy burst over time, the motor's power is no longer the limiting factor; the spring becomes the focus for maximizing jump height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Future Developments and Applications

The team has already begun building a fleet of jumping robots, including versions that can right themselves after landing for immediate re-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Others are steerable, featuring three adjustable legs that allow launching in any direction by forming a tripod to point the robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

While the current design has nearly maximized achievable height with its spring, further improvements could involve:
*   Making the robot 10 times isometrically larger to reduce the effect of air resistance, potentially increasing jump height by 15-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. A 10x scaled-up jumper's mass increases a thousandfold, while drag force only increases a hundredfold, leading to less drag effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   Storing kinetic energy back in the spring upon landing could lead to near-perfect efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Engineered jumpers would be ideal for [[applications_of_jumping_robots_in_space_exploration | space exploration]], particularly in environments with thin or non-existent atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. On the moon, with one-sixth of Earth's gravity, this robot could leap 125 meters high and half a kilometer forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Jumpers could navigate steep cliffs and deep craters, collecting samples for rovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The concept of work multiplication has the potential to revolutionize robotics, allowing robots to store and release vast amounts of energy by building it up over time from relatively small motors, thereby setting new world records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

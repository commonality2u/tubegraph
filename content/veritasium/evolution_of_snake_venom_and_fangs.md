## Overview
Snake venom is a complex biological weapon that evolved from saliva, primarily used for catching and digesting prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Each snake species possesses a unique venom tailored to the specific animals it hunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The venom gland itself is situated behind the snake's eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Evolutionary Development of Fangs
Originally, venom was delivered into a snake's mouth by its back teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. To this day, approximately two-thirds of all snake species are rear-fanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Over time, evolutionary pressures led to the fangs moving closer to the front of the jaw in some species, enhancing the snake's ability to capture and kill prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Concurrently, the fangs themselves evolved:
*   **Smooth Teeth:** Fangs began as ordinary, smooth teeth with venom flowing down the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Grooved Fangs:** Some snake lineages developed a groove in each fang to channel the venom flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Hollow Fangs:** In certain species, this groove deepened and eventually closed to form a hollow tube, allowing the teeth to literally inject venom into prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

However, hollow fangs are not the norm, existing in only about one-seventh of the world's snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. In Australia, almost all venomous snakes possess hollow fangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Potency and Composition of Venom
The Australian Reptile Park actively breeds snakes to produce more venom than their wild counterparts through selective breeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. For instance, some coastal taipans bred at the park produce five to seven times the venom of their wild relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. A scratch from these highly venomous animals can be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

The concept of the "most venomous snake" is complex because venom evolves for potency against specific prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Prey animals, in turn, can evolve resistance to venom; for example, the honey badger is almost completely immune to Cobra venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The lethality of a bite depends on the snake species, the bitten animal, and the amount of venom injected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

A 1979 study tested the venoms of 25 different snake species on lab mice to estimate the required [[venom_extraction_and_antivenom_production_process | antivenom]] dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Based on this, a single King Cobra bite could kill approximately 13,000 mice or around four human-sized rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The inland taipan, found in Australia, is considered the most venomous snake globally by this measure, with one bite containing enough venom to kill half a million mice or over 100 humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Types of Venom Effects
Snake venoms typically contain up to 200 compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. These venoms are lethal because they target molecular pathways that are conserved across vertebrates and even the entire tree of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The [[types_and_effects_of_snake_venom_on_humans | four main ways snake venom can kill]] include:
*   **Neurotoxic:** Damages the nervous system and brain by interfering with neurotransmitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Hemotoxic:** Thins blood, preventing wounds from healing and causing internal bleeding by disrupting blood coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Cytotoxic:** Attacks cells, leading to severe blisters, necrosis, and cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Myotoxic:** Destroys muscles and causes paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Most venoms contain a combination of these neurotoxic, hemotoxic, cytotoxic, and myotoxic proteins, making snake bites challenging to treat as dozens of toxins work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Human Susceptibility
Humans are particularly susceptible to snake venom because we are closely related to their main prey, rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Rodents and primates diverged on the evolutionary tree only about 75 million years ago, leading to shared biology, including cell structure, blood clotting mechanisms, and nerve signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

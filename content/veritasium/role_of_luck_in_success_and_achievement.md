Most individuals tend to overestimate their own contributions and underestimate those of others, a phenomenon known as **egocentric bias** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This bias is evident in surveys where authors of multi-author papers, or couples estimating housework, often report combined percentages exceeding 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This isn't due to a desire to appear more helpful, as the same overestimation applies to negative contributions like starting fights or creating messes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The underlying reason is that individuals vividly experience and remember their own actions, but not fully those of others, leading to an overestimation of personal involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This cognitive bias further leads people to underestimate the influence of external factors, such as luck, on their lives and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Examples of Luck's Influence

### The "Birthday Effect" in Hockey

A notable example of luck's role is observed in professional hockey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. In many years, 40% of hockey players selected into top-tier leagues are born in the first quarter of the year, compared to only 10% from the fourth quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. An early birthday can make a child up to four times more likely to become a professional hockey player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This disparity is attributed to the January 1st cutoff date for kids' hockey leagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Those born earlier in the year are slightly older, and thus on average bigger and faster than their peers born later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. These initial advantages compound over time as promising young players receive more ice time, enter more tournaments, and benefit from better coaching, leading to improved skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. By the time players reach professional levels, birthdays are significantly skewed towards the beginning of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Despite this, professional hockey players likely do not feel thankful for their birth month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, highlighting a general human tendency to overlook fortunate events that contribute to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Country of Birth

Perhaps the most significant element of luck for many individuals is their [[influence_of_societal_structures_and_country_of_birth_on_success | country of birth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Approximately half of the variance in global income is explained by a person's country of residence and that nation's income distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. For instance, being born in Burundi, with one of the world's lowest gross national incomes per capita, makes it highly improbable to earn much as an adult, regardless of one's intelligence or diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## [[the_interplay_between_skill_hard_work_and_luck | The Interplay Between Skill, Hard Work, and Luck]]

While many individuals are offended when the role of chance in their success is highlighted, believing it diminishes the value of their hard work and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, the reality is that both skill and luck are necessary for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Track and Field World Records

Consider eight track and field world records: seven out of eight were achieved with a tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. While the athletes were undoubtedly world-class, dedicated, and talented enough to win gold, setting a world record also required a bit of luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### NASA Astronaut Selection

The importance of luck increases significantly when there are many applicants for limited positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, in 2017, only 11 out of over 18,300 applicants were selected for the NASA astronaut training program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. A model simulating this selection process, assuming selection is 95% based on skill, experience, and hard work, and 5% on luck, revealed interesting insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. In 1,000 simulations, the selected astronauts had an average luck score of 94.7 out of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. On average, only 1.6 of the 11 selected astronauts would have made the top 11 based on skill alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This suggests that even with luck accounting for only 5% of the outcome, 9 or 10 of the 11 selected applicants would have been different if luck played no role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Therefore, in fierce competition, talent and hard work are crucial but insufficient to guarantee success; one also needs a lucky break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Downplaying Luck's Importance

People are often unaware of their good fortune because, by definition, it's not something they actively did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Counter-intuitively, downplaying the importance of chance events might actually increase one's probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. If an outcome is perceived as uncertain, individuals are less likely to invest effort, which further reduces their chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Thus, believing in complete control over one's destiny can be a useful delusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Justifying Status and Inequality

Overlooking lucky breaks also makes it easier for successful individuals to justify their place in society, attributing wealth or power solely to their own intelligence, effort, and perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This perspective can make it easier to accept inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

In an experiment, randomly assigned team leaders in a group discussion were given an extra cookie, despite having no special aptitude or responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Once a certain status is achieved, it feels natural to believe it's deserved, along with any associated benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Research supports that privileged individuals can act more entitled and uncourteous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

Another experiment showed that participants asked to list personal qualities contributing to a positive event donated 25% less to charity than those asked to list external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This highlights that attributing success solely to personal attributes can lead to less generosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Successful leaders, while undoubtedly talented and hard-working, are often unaware of their luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. They live in a form of **survivor bias**, where their experience of hard work leading to success distorts their view of reality, making the world appear fair and rewarding to hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. They lack the experience of those who worked hard and failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, leading them to conclude that less successful people are merely less talented or less hard-working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This perspective makes them less inclined to be generous or "give back," even though the very infrastructure of their successful country (roads, schools, public services, etc.) was established by previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Benefits of Acknowledging Luck

Acknowledging fortunate circumstances not only aligns one's perspective with reality but also makes individuals more likable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. A study found that an entrepreneur who acknowledged luck's role in their company's success was judged as kinder and more approachable than one who solely took personal credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Furthermore, raising awareness of fortunate events can lead to increased happiness through gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## A Paradoxical Approach to Success

Understanding the role of luck presents a paradox for achieving success in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>:
1.  **Believe in complete control**: Individuals should act as if they are in full control of their destiny and that success depends solely on their talent and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This belief can be a useful delusion to encourage effort and perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
2.  **Acknowledge luck's role**: Simultaneously, one must recognize that this belief is not entirely true for themselves or anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. If success is achieved, it's crucial to remember that luck played a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Given this good fortune, successful individuals should then strive to increase the luck of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

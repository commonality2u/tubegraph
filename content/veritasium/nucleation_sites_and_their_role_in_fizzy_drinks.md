It is a common belief that shaking a carbonated drink causes the pressure inside the bottle to increase, leading to an explosion upon opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, this is a misconception, and the actual cause involves [[shaken_carbonated_drinks_and_pressure_dynamics | nucleation sites]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

## Pressure in Shaken Carbonated Drinks

When a closed carbonated drink that has been sitting at equilibrium is shaken, the pressure in the headspace of the bottle does not increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. This phenomenon, which was once incorrectly published in *New Scientist* in 1986, has since been disproven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. For most modern soda bottles, the equilibrium pressure is approximately 3 atmospheres (330 kiloPascals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

## The Role of Equilibrium

A carbonated drink found in a grocery store has typically been stationary for a few days, allowing the dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in the liquid to reach equilibrium with the CO2 gas in the headspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. This equilibrium is solely dependent on the temperature and the pressure of the gas in the headspace, meaning that shaking alone will not alter this pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

## Why Drinks Fizz When Opened

When a bottle is opened, the pressure in the headspace drops from about 3 atmospheres to 1 atmosphere (ambient pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. This change means the liquid is no longer in equilibrium, as it contains more dissolved CO2 than would be at equilibrium at the lower pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. Consequently, CO2 begins to come out of solution, forming the bubbles that give the drink its fizziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. If left open, the bubbles will continue to escape until the drink becomes flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

Coming out of solution spontaneously is a very slow process for dissolved gases like CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Nucleation Sites

Nucleation sites are crucial for accelerating the release of dissolved CO2 from solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. These sites provide a surface or a starting point where gas bubbles can form and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

### Shaking and Nucleation Sites

When a carbonated bottle is shaken, tiny air bubbles are introduced into the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. These bubbles act as [[shaken_carbonated_drinks_and_pressure_dynamics | nucleation sites]], making it significantly easier for CO2 to come out of solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. While the pressure in a closed, shaken bottle doesn't increase, the introduction of these bubbles, some of which cling to the bottle's walls, is what causes the explosive reaction upon opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

Upon opening:
1.  The bubbles expand due to the decrease in pressure, pushing the liquid above them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.
2.  They also act as nucleation sites, allowing dissolved CO2 to rapidly come out of solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. This combined effect leads to the messy eruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

### Disarming a Shaken Beverage

To safely open a shaken carbonated beverage, one can flick the walls of the bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. This action dislodges the tiny air bubbles clinging to the sides, removing the nucleation sites and allowing the bottle to be opened without incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

## Other Nucleation Site Examples

*   **Mentos:** The rough surface of a Mentos candy provides numerous nucleation sites when dropped into a carbonated drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. This allows CO2 to come out of solution much faster, leading to the well-known soda fountain effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.
*   **Paper Straws:** Preliminary analysis suggests that paper straws create more bubbles in carbonated drinks than plastic straws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. This is likely due to the rougher surface of paper providing more nucleation sites, causing the drink to become more fizzy as it travels up the straw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

## What is Egocentric Bias?
[[cognitive_biases_in_problem_solving | Egocentric bias]] is a phenomenon where most individuals believe they contribute the majority of the work or are responsible for most problems within a shared context [[00:00:16]](e.g., a household, a collaborative project). This bias extends beyond merely wanting to appear helpful [[00:00:39]]; people also tend to overestimate their negative contributions, such as starting fights or making messes [[00:00:45]].

### Examples of Egocentric Bias
*   **COVID Lockdown Headline** A viral headline during the COVID lockdown stated that "Nearly half of men say they do most of the homeschooling," while "three percent of women agree" [[00:00:03]].
*   **Multi-Author Papers** Researchers found that when authors of multi-author papers were asked to estimate their personal contribution, the combined percentages averaged 140% [[00:00:19]].
*   **Household Chores** Couples estimating their share of housework almost always reported a combined total exceeding 100% [[00:00:32]].
*   **Couple Disagreements** Similarly, when couples were asked about their responsibility for starting fights or creating messes, the total also surpassed 100% [[00:00:45]].

### Root Cause of Egocentric Bias
The primary reason for this bias is that individuals vividly experience and remember all of their own actions, but not all of the actions of others [[00:00:58]]. This leads to an overestimation of one's own contributions and an underestimation of others' [[00:01:05]].

## Underestimating the Role of Luck
Egocentric bias can lead to underestimating the influence of external factors, such as luck, on one's success [[00:01:10]].

### Examples of Luck's Influence
*   **Hockey Players' Birthdays** A significant percentage of hockey players selected into top-tier leagues are born in the first quarter of the year (40%), compared to only 10% in the fourth quarter [[00:01:32]]. This is largely due to the January 1st cutoff date for kids' hockey leagues, giving earlier-born children a slight age, size, and speed advantage early on [[00:01:47]]. These initial advantages compound over time through more ice time, tournaments, and better coaching [[00:02:05]], heavily skewing professional players' birthdays towards the beginning of the year [[00:02:15]].
*   **Country of Residence** Being born into a prosperous country is a major factor in an individual's success, explaining about half the variance in global income [[00:02:31]]. For instance, someone born in Burundi, with a significantly low gross national income per capita, is unlikely to earn much regardless of their intelligence or hard work [[00:02:43]].
*   **Athletic Records** Seven out of eight track and field world records analyzed were achieved with a tailwind [[00:03:13]]. While the athletes were world-class, dedicated, and talented, setting a world record required an additional element of luck [[00:03:25]].
*   **NASA Astronaut Selection** In a toy model simulating the 2017 NASA astronaut selection (where 11 were chosen from over 18,300 applicants [[00:03:37]]), even if luck accounted for only 5% of the selection criteria, the chosen astronauts were found to be very lucky (average luck score of 94.7 out of 100) [[00:04:03]]. On average, only 1.6 of the selected astronauts would have been in the top 11 based on skill alone [[00:04:44]]. This demonstrates that in fierce competition, talent and hard work are necessary but not sufficient; a "break" is also required [[00:05:00]].

## Reactions to Acknowledging Luck
Many people are offended when the role of chance in their success is highlighted, feeling it diminishes their hard work and talent [[00:02:55]]. There is a common belief that success is explained by either skill or luck, rather than a combination of both [[00:03:06]].

### The "Useful Delusion"
Paradoxically, downplaying the importance of chance events may increase the probability of success [[00:05:19]]. If an outcome is perceived as uncertain, individuals are less likely to invest effort, which further reduces their chances of success [[00:05:25]]. Therefore, believing oneself to be in full control of destiny can be a "useful delusion" [[00:05:32]].

## Societal Implications and Entitlement
Overlooking good fortune can make it easier for individuals to justify their position in society, attributing wealth or power solely to their own intelligence, effort, and perseverance [[00:05:47]]. This perspective can make it easier to accept [[psychological_perspectives_on_inequality_and_entitlement | inequality]] [[00:06:00]].

### Studies on Entitlement
*   **The Cookie Experiment** In an experiment, randomly designated team leaders in small groups, despite having no special aptitude or extra responsibilities, consistently took the extra cookie when four cookies were offered to a group of three [[00:06:03]]. This suggests that once a certain status is achieved, feeling deserving of it and associated benefits seems natural [[00:06:28]].
*   **Charity Donation Experiment** Participants who attributed a recent positive event to their own personal qualities donated 25% less to charity than those who listed external factors beyond their control as reasons for the event [[00:07:06]].

### Survivor Bias and Leaders' Perspectives
Successful leaders, who are undoubtedly talented and hard-working, often fail to realize how lucky they have been [[00:07:31]]. They can live in a form of [[cognitive_biases_in_problem_solving | survivor bias]], where their experience of success leads them to believe the world is fair and rewards hard work [[00:07:44]]. They lack the experience of those who worked hard but failed [[00:07:55]]. This leads them to conclude that less successful people are simply less talented or less hard-working, making them less inclined to be generous or "give back" [[00:08:00]]. This is particularly significant as these individuals often set societal rules [[00:08:12]].

## Benefits of Acknowledging Luck
Acknowledging fortunate circumstances brings one closer to reality and offers several benefits:
*   **Increased Likability** In a study, a fictional biotech entrepreneur who credited luck for their company's success was judged as kinder and more likely to be a close friend than one who took personal credit [[00:09:06]].
*   **Greater Happiness** Raising awareness of fortunate events can foster gratitude, leading to increased happiness [[00:09:23]].

## Paradoxical Advice for Success
To navigate the world effectively while acknowledging the role of luck, a paradoxical approach is suggested:
1.  **Believe in Complete Control:** To be motivated and driven, one must believe they are in complete control of their destiny, and that success depends solely on their talent and hard work [[00:10:34]].
2.  **Acknowledge Luck:** Simultaneously, one must recognize that this belief is not entirely true for themselves or anyone else [[00:10:43]]. If success is achieved, it is crucial to remember that luck played a significant role and, given that good fortune, one should strive to increase the luck of others [[00:10:48]].

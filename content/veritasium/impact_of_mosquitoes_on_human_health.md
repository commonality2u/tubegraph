Mosquitoes are considered the most dangerous animal in the world due to their profound impact on human health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:46">[09:44:46]</a>. They are responsible for transmitting numerous diseases that cause widespread illness and death globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

## Mosquitoes as Disease Vectors

Of all animals, mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. It is estimated that this year alone, over a million people will die from mosquito-borne illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. Some estimates suggest mosquitoes have killed more than half of all humans who have ever lived, though this specific figure is debated and likely too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. Nevertheless, they have certainly caused more deaths than any other single cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

Professor Immo Hansen states that "Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Malaria, a disease transmitted by mosquitoes, profoundly illustrates their danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

### Malaria's [[evolutionary_aspects_of_human_interaction_with_mosquitoes | Evolutionary]] Adaptation

If a person contracts malaria, their body chemistry changes to produce an odor that makes them more attractive to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. This means the malaria parasite has [[evolutionary_aspects_of_human_interaction_with_mosquitoes | evolved]] to make its host more attractive to the very mosquitoes that transmit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Mosquito Attraction

Mosquitoes are more attracted to some individuals than others, a phenomenon that is at least partially [[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | genetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Only female mosquitoes bite, as they require blood proteins to produce their eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

Several factors contribute to an individual's attractiveness to mosquitoes:
*   **Volatile Chemicals and Odor** The attractiveness is likely related to the odor or volatile chemicals given off by human bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. This includes the influence of the skin's microbiome, the bacteria present on the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.
*   **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)** Mosquitoes are primarily drawn to carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Therefore, individuals with higher metabolism, those who have exercised recently, larger people, or pregnant individuals are more likely to attract mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.
*   **Other Volatile Compounds** Mosquitoes are also attracted to other volatile compounds such as lactic acid, acetone, and ammonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.
*   **Repelling Chemicals** Some naturally occurring chemicals, including octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, can repel mosquitoes or impair their ability to locate humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

### [[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | Genetic Factors]]
[[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | Genetics]] play a significant role in determining how attractive a person is to mosquitoes, estimated to be as hereditary as height or IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. [[Research on mosquito preferences | Research]] has identified specific locations on DNA that correlate with an individual's likelihood of being attractive to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This understanding of the [[the_role_of_dna_in_determining_attractiveness_to_mosquitoes | genetic basis of mosquito attractiveness]] is crucial, especially given the profound impact mosquitoes have on human health worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

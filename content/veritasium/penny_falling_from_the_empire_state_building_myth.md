From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The idea that a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building could kill someone on the sidewalk below is a widespread urban legend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This myth has been widely circulated, with many people hearing the story and believing it to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Evidence of its popularity can be seen by the ledges below the Empire State Building's observation deck, which are "filled with change," suggesting people throw pennies over, perhaps testing the myth themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Experiment

Despite its prevalence, the myth has been debunked. The video's host, Derek, along with former MythBuster Adam Savage, conducted an experiment to test the theory directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Adam Savage dropped pennies from a helicopter onto Derek below, simulating a drop from a significant height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

During the experiment:
*   Derek initially felt terrified standing under the helicopter due to the "rotor wash" (downward airflow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   Upon being hit, the pennies felt like "tiny little bullets" and caused a sting, leading Derek to believe he would be bruised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   However, the final conclusion was that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building "is not gonna hurt" fatally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. It might sting a little, but it is not deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## The Science of Falling Objects

The reason the myth is false lies in the principles of [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] and terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Air Resistance and Terminal Velocity
When an object falls through the air, it experiences two main forces: gravity pulling it down and air resistance pushing it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. As an object accelerates, the force of air resistance increases proportionally to the square of its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Eventually, the upward force of air resistance equals the downward force of gravity, and the object stops accelerating, reaching a constant speed known as its terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

*   **Hammer and Feather Experiment**: A classic demonstration on the moon shows a hammer and feather falling at the same rate due to gravity in a near vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. On Earth, however, the hammer lands first because the feather quickly reaches its terminal velocity due to its higher ratio of air resistance to weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The hammer, being much heavier, experiences a larger force of air resistance, but this force is negligible compared to its weight, so it continues to accelerate until impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Factors Affecting Terminal Velocity**: Every object has its own terminal velocity, which is the maximum speed it will reach in free fall through still air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. It depends on the ratio of an object's weight to its air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Air resistance itself is affected by:
    *   **Cross-sectional area**: Larger areas generally mean more resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   **Overall shape**: Captured by the "Drag Coefficient," which indicates how smoothly air flows around an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Bullets, for instance, are designed for low drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
    *   **Density of air**: Air resistance is directly proportional to air density. At higher altitudes, where air is less dense, terminal velocity is much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Felix Baumgartner, for example, broke the sound barrier during his stratospheric jump due to the extremely thin air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Terminal Velocity of a Penny
A penny reaches its terminal velocity after falling only about 15 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This means that whether a penny is dropped from 15 meters, 300 meters, or 3000 meters, it will hit the ground at the same speed, which is around 80 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This speed is not enough to cause serious harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

Pennies also "flutter and tumble as they fall," making them hard to aim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This tumbling behavior means a penny doesn't have a single terminal velocity, but rather oscillates between two: one on its face and one on its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Adam Savage demonstrated this phenomenon using a custom-built wind tunnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Other Falling Objects and Their Danger

### Ballpoint Pens
The myth extends to other objects, with some suggesting that ballpoint pens falling from a skyscraper could be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Plastic ballpoint pens weigh about twice as much as a penny and have a smaller cross-sectional area, which would theoretically increase their terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. However, an experiment using a ballistics gel dummy showed that these plastic pens also seem to have too much drag relative to their weight to achieve a high terminal velocity, rendering them non-lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Adam Savage declared this myth "busted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Narrow metal pens, however, might still pose a danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

### Bullets
A bullet dropped from a skyscraper would not behave as expected. Instead of falling pointy side down, it would tumble and likely fall on its side, experiencing significantly more air resistance than if it were fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This increased drag means it would reach a much slower terminal velocity compared to its fired speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

However, a bullet fired *straight up* is different. While it slows down and stops at its peak (up to three kilometers high), it would then fall back down tumbling, and thus be much slower than its initial speed when it hits the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. If a bullet is fired at an angle, it maintains horizontal velocity and spin, keeping it pointy-side forward, and thus returning to the ground at a significant fraction of its launch speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. This is why celebratory gunfire, where bullets are often fired into the air at an angle, has led to hundreds of cases of people being struck and killed worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

### Military Projectiles (Fléchettes)
The concept of dropping deadly projectiles from height is almost as old as aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. In World War I, small metal darts called fléchettes (French for "little arrow") were dropped from planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. These were essentially nails with feathers to ensure they fell straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Some were up to 15 centimeters long and could pierce helmets, causing serious injuries and even passing through a rider and their horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Later, the US used similar but heftier weapons called Lazy Dogs in the Korean and Vietnam wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

## [[Hazards of falling objects in general | General Hazards of Falling Objects]]

[[Hazards of falling objects in general | Falling objects]] are a significant danger in civilian life, with nearly 700 Americans dying each year from being struck by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. These objects include:
*   Loose tiles and bricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>
*   Falling construction tools (e.g., a measuring tape falling 50 stories killed a man in 2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>
*   Falling rocks and tree branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>
*   Icicles (a concern for buildings like New York's One World Trade Center) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>

### Lethality Threshold
The lower limit of energy required to fracture a human skull is around 68 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Anything with kinetic energy greater than this is very likely to be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

*   **Raindrop**: Delivers only 0.002 Joules at terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Raindrops have a low terminal velocity of just 25 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Penny**: Has about 0.2 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Hail**: Can reach terminal velocities over 200 kilometers per hour, around 10 times that of rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This is because hailstones can get much bigger than raindrops, and their weight scales faster with size than their drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. A large hailstone can deliver more than 80 Joules, enough to crack a skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Hail injures around 20 people and has caused four fatalities in the US since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Baseball**: Can also deliver over 80 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Fléchette**: While its energy might not be enough to fracture a skull, its ability to apply a large force to a very small area makes it dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

In conclusion, objects weighing only a few grams that are not aerodynamic, like pennies and plastic pens, are not fatal when falling from great heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. However, objects weighing more than a few hundred grams traveling at their terminal velocity are likely to be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

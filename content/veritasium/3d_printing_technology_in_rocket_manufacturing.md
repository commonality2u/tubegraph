Relativity Space, a startup, has developed the world's largest 3D metal printer, named Stargate, with the ambitious goal of 3D printing an entire rocket, including fuel tanks and engines, in just 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This represents a significant shift from traditional aerospace manufacturing methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## The 3D Printing Process

Relativity Space's Stargate printer utilizes a wire melt team and a print head that moves around, performing actions every couple of milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03">[01:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10">[01:10]</a>. The process involves plasma discharge and precise control of the electric waveform to manage deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07">[01:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16">[01:16]</a>. The metal used is an aluminum alloy on a wire spool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45">[01:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49">[01:49]</a>. This wire is deposited at a rate of approximately 10 inches per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51">[01:51]</a>. Lasers and plasma arc discharge work together to melt the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58">[01:58]</a>. The printing occurs just above the melting point of aluminum, which is 660 degrees Celsius, effectively melting the rocket body together bit by bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22">[01:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32">[01:32]</a>.

The resulting surface of the 3D printed rocket still shows layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>, which only add an extra 5 to 10% of mass due to roughness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59">[04:59]</a>. This surface roughness does not cause aerodynamic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>. To achieve precise shapes, Relativity Space developed software that "reverse warps" the part before printing, counteracting warping that occurs during cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40">[05:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58">[05:58]</a>. This complex computational solver addresses many of the [[challenges_and_solutions_in_3d_printing_rockets | challenges and solutions in 3D printing rockets]] to make rocket printing viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02">[06:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08">[06:08]</a>.

## [[advantages_of_3d_printed_rockets | Advantages of 3D Printed Rockets]]

### Reduced Parts and Complexity
One of the major [[advantages_of_3d_printed_rockets | benefits of 3D printing]] is the significant reduction in the number of parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15">[08:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17">[08:17]</a>. For example, a traditional rocket engine injector, which mixes propellants to produce thrust, might consist of over a thousand individual pieces and take nine months to manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03">[08:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06">[08:06]</a>. With 3D printing, the entire injector can be printed as one piece in two weeks, at one-tenth of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08">[08:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14">[08:14]</a>.

Similarly, rocket nozzles traditionally required thousands of small pipes to be painstakingly braze-welded together for cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">[08:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06">[09:06]</a>. With 3D printing, the complex cooling channels can be integrated directly into a single printed part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20">[09:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31">[09:31]</a>. Smaller parts like these are typically 3D printed using metal powder and lasers, laying down fine layers approximately a 20th the thickness of a human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34">[09:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51">[09:51]</a>.

Relativity Space aims for their fully 3D printed rocket to have 100 times fewer parts than traditionally manufactured rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35">[00:13:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This reduction in part count is a key aspect of automation in aerospace, as it shifts assembly from physical robots to the 3D design file itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41">[00:15:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Rapid Iteration and Design Flexibility
3D printing enables rapid iteration in design and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41">[10:41]</a>. Engineers can quickly build and test a part, then redesign and print a new version rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43">[10:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48">[10:48]</a>. For instance, an engine design can evolve significantly in a few years because new versions can be printed and improved monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50">[10:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24">[11:24]</a>. This "software-driven manufacturing" means part geometries are controlled by the CAD model, allowing for extremely fast design changes as there is no fixed tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03">[11:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16">[11:16]</a>.

### Stronger Materials
Counterintuitively, 3D printed metals can be stronger than traditionally built materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09">[10:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17">[10:17]</a>. Relativity Space develops its own custom alloys for 3D printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21">[10:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24">[10:24]</a>. The rapid melting, cooling, and solidification process allows for the creation of very strong alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28">[10:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35">[10:35]</a>. This falls under the realm of [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | material science in robotic engineering]].

## Impact on Rocket Design
[[Innovations in origamiinspired technology | 3D printing technology]] allows for the creation of parts that would be impractical or impossible using traditional manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54">[11:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58">[11:58]</a>. Engineers can now build smooth, curvy, and bio-inspired designs as easily as ordinary structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00">[12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06">[12:06]</a>. This means the optimal structure for a rocket, even if it looks unconventional, can be realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29">[12:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34">[12:34]</a>. Relativity Space is actively designing features into their rockets that can only be manufactured via 3D printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35">[12:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42">[12:42]</a>, leading to a fundamentally different design compared to traditional rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46">[12:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51">[12:51]</a>.

For instance, the rocket tank structure, the largest 3D printed product ever made that will fly to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46">[04:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>, incorporates printed stiffeners that prevent buckling and crumpling, similar to how internal pressure keeps a Coke can from collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41">[06:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10">[07:10]</a>. Despite its size, a rocket tank is thinner relative to its diameter than a Coke can, necessitating lightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14">[07:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27">[07:27]</a>.

## Relativity Space's Vision and [[future_implications_of_3d_printed_rockets_on_space_exploration | Future Implications]]

Relativity Space's first rocket, Terran One, is primarily for low-Earth orbit missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01">[16:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03">[16:03]</a>. Their larger, next-generation rocket, Terran R, will be capable of sending payloads to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05">[16:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08">[16:08]</a>. The ultimate long-term vision of the company is to shrink down their "factory of the future" to launch to Mars and establish an industrial base there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19">[16:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29">[16:29]</a>.

## [[Space exploration challenges | Future Outlook and Cost Reduction]]
While traditional aerospace manufacturing, exemplified by projects like NASA's Space Launch System (SLS), relies on building custom tools before building the rocket itself—a process that took 11 years for SLS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[03:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08">[04:08]</a>—Relativity Space aims to launch its first rocket within five and a half years of its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[04:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>. This highlights a shift from an "old engineering style" to a "Silicon Valley style" of rapid iteration and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18">[04:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>.

This approach significantly lowers costs, with current rockets costing about five times less, and a potential to reach 10 or even 100 times cheaper with fully reusable rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31">[17:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42">[17:42]</a>. The adoption of automation in aerospace has been slow, unlike in the automotive industry, because rockets are not mass-produced like cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04">[15:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20">[15:20]</a>. 3D printing serves as automation for aerospace by eliminating the need to assemble millions of individual parts with robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41">[15:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52">[15:52]</a>.

While it is debated if 3D printing will be the sole method for rocket manufacturing in the long term, especially if high production volumes are reached, Relativity Space is seen as a leader in 3D printing rocket hardware due to their comprehensive efforts in applying the technology to areas previously dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40">[16:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12">[17:12]</a>.

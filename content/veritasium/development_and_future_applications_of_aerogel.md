[[Aerogel properties and composition | Aerogel]] is known as the world's lightest, or least dense, solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A typical piece might have a mass of just 1.22 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, which is only a few times the mass of the same volume of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This is because aerogel is approximately 99.8% air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Some aerogels are so light that if all the air were removed, they would be less dense than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## [[History and invention of aerogel | History and Invention]]

[[History and invention of aerogel | Aerogel]] was invented in 1931 by Professor Samuel Kistler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Kistler made a bet with his colleague Charles Learned about whether it was possible to remove the liquid from a jelly without affecting its solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Jellies are a combination of liquids and solids, mostly liquid embedded within a 3D solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. If the liquid is simply evaporated, the solid structure shrinks due to the pulling forces of liquid molecules on each other and on the solid structure, causing it to crumple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Kistler solved this problem in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>:
1.  **Liquid Replacement**: He realized that one liquid could be replaced with another inside the jelly by thoroughly washing it, for instance, swapping water for alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Supercritical Drying**: The jelly is then placed in a high-pressure vessel called an autoclave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. By heating it to the critical point of the liquid (a high-temperature, high-pressure point), the liquid transforms into a semi-liquid, semi-gas state known as a supercritical fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. At this point, there is no longer a distinction between liquid and gas, and the molecules stop pulling on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Once the vessel is depressurized, the solid skeleton, which accounts for only about 1% of the gel's mass, is left behind intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The pores, formerly filled with liquid, are now filled with gas, forming the nanoporous solid known as [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Kistler published his findings in Nature in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. He created aerogels from various materials, including eggs, rubber, nitrocellulose, and silica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A wet silica gel, for example, is 97% alcohol within its pores, with the remaining 3% being amorphous silica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This wet gel is rubbery but very easy to break and crumbly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The next step in its production involves replacing the alcohol with liquid carbon dioxide (CO₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Liquid CO₂ is advantageous because it is non-flammable and has a low critical temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Heating the liquid CO₂ to its critical point (which can be done with a hairdryer) makes its surface blurry before it disappears altogether, indicating the formation of a supercritical fluid of CO₂ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. In this state, the CO₂ can be vented without affecting the solid structure, leaving behind [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## [[Properties of aerogel | Properties]] and Capabilities

### Transparency and Color
[[Aerogel properties and composition | Aerogel]] is almost impossible to see on a light background because it is quite transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. However, against a darker background, it exhibits a slight bluish color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This bluish hue is due to Rayleigh scattering, similar to why the sky is blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The tiny nanoscale structures within aerogel scatter shorter wavelengths like blue much more intensely than longer wavelengths like yellow or red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Consequently, [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] appears opaque in ultraviolet light but transparent in infrared light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. When viewed against a blue sky, aerogel appears yellow because it scatters out the blue light, allowing longer wavelengths (yellows and oranges) to pass through to the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This is analogous to seeing the yellows and oranges of a sunset, where blue light has been scattered by the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### [[Thermal insulation capabilities of aerogel | Thermal Insulation]]
The nanoscale pores also make [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] an excellent [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal insulator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Although aerogel is largely air (99% air), its [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal properties]] are superior to those of plain air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This is because the width of its pores is smaller than the mean free path of air molecules—the average distance air molecules travel before colliding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This phenomenon, known as the Knudsen effect, makes it difficult for hot, fast-moving air molecules to diffuse through the aerogel and transfer heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

An experiment demonstrating its insulating power involved placing a chocolate bunny on a piece of aerogel and subjecting it to a Bunsen burner flame, while a control bunny was placed on a glass petri dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The glass petri dish became very hot quickly, and the chocolate bunny on it began melting and smoking after just one minute, eventually reaching "material fail" as the petri dish cracked under thermal expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. In contrast, after nearly three minutes, with the flame reaching 600 degrees Celsius (1250 Fahrenheit) underneath, the chocolate bunny on the [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] showed no sign of melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Even after four minutes, the bunny was only slightly soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, and the aerogel itself remained cool to the touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Durability and [[Hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics of aerogel | Hydrophobicity]]
Original silica [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] is [[hydrophobic_and_hydrophilic_characteristics_of_aerogel | hydrophilic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, meaning it absorbs water and is essentially ruined if it gets wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. However, scientists are working on increasing its durability and finding ways to make it waterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Some newer aerogels also possess elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## [[Applications and uses of aerogel | Applications]] and Future Development

### [[Uses of aerogel in space exploration | Space Exploration]]
[[Uses of aerogel in space exploration | NASA]] has extensively used [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] for insulation on various Martian rovers, including Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity, and Curiosity, with plans for its use on future Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The primary reason for this is to keep electronics warm during the extremely cold Martian nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Beyond insulation, [[uses_of_aerogel_in_space_exploration | NASA]] employed [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] for a more unique purpose in the Stardust mission: to catch dust from a comet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Comet particles travel at very high speeds, about six kilometers per second relative to the [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Due to its very low density and porous nature, particles hit the aerogel, enter it, and gradually lose energy as they break apart its internal network, eventually coming to a stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This method is effective for capturing particles intact, unlike hitting a solid surface which would cause them to stop and vaporize immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

### Future Everyday [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel | Applications]]
While [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]]'s unique [[properties_of_aerogel | properties]] make it highly desirable, its widespread everyday use is currently limited. A humorous hypothetical application suggests its use for [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal insulation]] in skyscrapers built in Antarctica, where extreme cold would make its high [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal efficiency]] crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This would allow for much thinner insulation, like six inches of [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] instead of ten feet of fiberglass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

Scientists are actively working on reducing the costs of [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] production and increasing its durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Significant progress has already been made in these areas, including developing waterproof versions of [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. These advancements suggest a future where [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] could become more common in various [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel | applications]].

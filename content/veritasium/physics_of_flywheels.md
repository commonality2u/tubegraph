The behavior of a spinning flywheel can be demonstrated using a specific apparatus to illustrate principles such as [[gyroscopic_effect_and_bicycle_stability | gyroscopic precession]] and [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | weight and torque dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This provides an [[applying_physics_in_educational_demonstrations | experimental demonstration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Apparatus

An [[experimental_demonstrations_in_physics | experimental demonstration]] apparatus consists of a 40-pound (19 kilogram) flywheel attached to the end of a one-meter-long shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Without the flywheel spinning, it is virtually impossible to hold the shaft horizontally with just one hand at its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Even lifting it over the head from one end without it spinning is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Demonstrating Gyroscopic Precession

When the flywheel is spun up to a few thousand RPM (rotations per minute), the dynamics change dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. If held from one end, the shaft remains horizontal, seemingly defying gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The wheel appears almost weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Instead of the wheel's weight pulling it straight down, the weight creates a torque that pushes the shaft around in a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This phenomenon is known as [[gyroscopic_effect_and_bicycle_stability | gyroscopic precession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

An even more extreme demonstration involves lifting the spinning flywheel over one's head with a single hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Despite its 19-kilogram mass, when spinning rapidly, it feels "incredibly, incredibly light" when lifted in this manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It feels as though the apparatus "was wanting to go up by itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Perceived vs. Actual Weight

Despite the perception of lightness, the flywheel is not actually weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. When a person holds the flywheel while standing on a scale, the scale reading reflects the combined weight of the person and the apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

For example, if a person weighs approximately 72 kilograms, picking up the 19-kilogram flywheel increases the scale reading to about 91 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. When the flywheel is spinning and being lifted overhead, the scale reading remains equal to 91 kilograms, demonstrating that its actual [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | weight]] does not change, only the way the force is distributed and perceived due to the [[gyroscopic_effect_and_bicycle_stability | gyroscopic effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

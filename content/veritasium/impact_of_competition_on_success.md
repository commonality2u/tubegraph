From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Success in competitive environments is often attributed solely to personal effort and talent, but external factors and [[role_of_luck_in_success | luck]] play a significant role that is frequently underestimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This underestimation can be linked to egocentric bias, where individuals overvalue their own contributions while undervaluing others' or external influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Egocentric Bias and Perceived Contributions

Egocentric bias leads most people to believe they do most of the work in collaborative efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For instance, authors of multi-author papers, when asked about their personal contribution, collectively report sums averaging 140 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Similarly, couples almost always estimate their combined housework contributions to be over 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This bias extends to negative contributions as well; people believe they cause more of the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This phenomenon occurs because individuals vividly experience and remember their own actions, but not fully those of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This bias leads to underestimating the influence of other factors, including [[role_of_luck_in_success | luck]], on personal success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## The Compounding Effect of Early Advantages

In competitive fields, small early advantages, often due to [[role_of_luck_in_success | luck]], can compound over time:

*   **Hockey Players**: A significant number of professional hockey players selected into top-tier leagues are born early in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. In many years, 40% of top-tier hockey players are born in the first quarter, compared to just 10% in the fourth quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This means an early birthday can make someone up to four times more likely to become a professional hockey player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Reason for Disparity**: The cutoff date for kids' hockey leagues is typically January 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Children born early in the year are slightly older, and thus, on average, bigger and faster than their peers born later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Compounding Advantages**: Promising young players receive more ice time, enter more tournaments, and benefit from better coaching, which enhances their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. These advantages build year after year, leading to a heavy skew of birthdays towards the start of the year among professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Despite this, professional hockey players likely don't attribute their success to their birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Skill, Luck, and World Records

While talent and hard work are crucial, [[role_of_luck_in_success | luck]] can be the decisive factor in achieving peak performance in competitive settings:

*   **Track and Field**: All athletes setting world records are exceptionally skilled and dedicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. However, for seven out of eight track and field world records analyzed, the athlete had a tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This suggests that while ability allows for winning gold, a bit of luck is needed to set a world record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## The Role of Luck in Highly Competitive Fields

The importance of [[role_of_luck_in_success | luck]] increases significantly when competition is fierce and there are few available positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

*   **NASA Astronaut Selection**: In 2017, over 18,300 applicants competed for only 11 spots in the NASA astronaut training program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   **Simulation**: A model assuming selection is 95% based on skill/experience and 5% on luck (fortunate circumstances) was run a thousand times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   **Results**: Astronauts selected in the simulation were found to be very lucky, with an average luck score of 94.7 (out of 100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   **Impact of Luck**: On average, only 1.6 of the 11 selected astronauts would have been in the top 11 based on skill alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This indicates that even with luck accounting for just 5% of the outcome, 9 or 10 of the 11 selected applicants would have been different if luck played no role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   **Conclusion**: In fierce competition, talent and hard work are necessary but not sufficient to guarantee success; a "break" is also needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Survivor Bias and Perceptions of Fairness

Individuals in positions of power, such as business leaders and politicians, are often talented and hard-working, but they have also been luckier than most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Unaware of their own luck, they may develop a distorted view of reality, living in a form of survivor bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

*   **Distorted View**: Because these leaders have worked hard and succeeded, the world appears fair to them, rewarding hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Lack of Experience**: They lack the experience of those who worked hard and failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: This perspective can lead them to conclude that less successful people are simply less talented or less hard-working, making them less inclined to be generous or "give back" to the societal structures that enabled their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This is particularly impactful as they are the ones who set societal rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Paradoxical Advice for Success

To navigate a competitive world, the best advice is paradoxical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>:

1.  **Believe in Control**: One must believe in complete control over their destiny, and that success is solely due to talent and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This belief can be a "useful delusion" because perceiving an outcome as uncertain can decrease effort, thereby reducing the chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
2.  **Acknowledge Luck**: Simultaneously, one must know that this belief isn't entirely true for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. If success is achieved, it's crucial to remember that [[role_of_luck_in_success | luck]] played a significant role, and therefore, one should strive to increase the luck of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

Acknowledging fortunate circumstances not only aligns with reality but also makes individuals more likable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> and can lead to increased gratitude and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

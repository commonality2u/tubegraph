Researchers employ tiny magnets in experiments to precisely [[control_of_spider_movement_in_experiments | control]] the visual input for [[jumping_spider_behavior | jumping spiders]] during studies on their color discrimination abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Purpose of Magnet Use

The primary challenge in studying [[jumping_spider_behavior | jumping spiders]] is that their natural movement and responses can alter what they perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. To overcome this, scientists need to maintain strict [[control_of_spider_movement_in_experiments | control over what the spiders can see]] at any given moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This is achieved by holding the spiders in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Experimental Setup

To secure the spiders without impeding their intended direction of gaze, researchers attach tiny magnets to their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While held, the spiders are given a ball to stand on, which they hold with their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Researchers monitor the movement of this ball to infer where the spider intends to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For example, if a spider turns the ball to the left, it suggests the spider is attempting to look to the right to follow a moving shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This method provides evidence that the spider can distinguish between the colors of a shape and its background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The visual stimulus for the spider consists of a screen displaying a moving shape that differs in color from the background but not in brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

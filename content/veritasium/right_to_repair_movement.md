The "Right to Repair" movement advocates for legislation that would require manufacturers to make it easier for consumers and third-party repair shops to fix their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This movement is a response to the practice of [[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | planned obsolescence]], where companies intentionally shorten product lifespans or make them difficult to repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Goals of the Legislation
Proposed "Right to Repair" laws aim to force manufacturers to:
*   Provide necessary information for repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   Grant access to parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

This would allow consumers to replace components like batteries or fix cracked screens at third-party repair shops without voiding their warranty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Geographic Scope
As of the video's recording, proposed "Right to Repair" legislation existed in the European Union and in over 25 states in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Context: Planned Obsolescence
The "Right to Repair" movement directly confronts practices like [[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | planned obsolescence]], which gained prominence with the Phoebus Cartel's actions in the light bulb industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Apple and Planned Obsolescence
Apple has faced significant scrutiny and legal challenges regarding its practices of limiting product lifespans:
*   **iPod Battery Issue (2003):** Casey Neistat's viral video in 2003 highlighted the issue of non-replaceable iPod batteries, leading to a class-action lawsuit that Apple settled out of court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **iPhone Performance Throttling (2017):** After an iOS update in 2017, users of older iPhones experienced significant slowdowns or device shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Apple stated this was to protect the battery and increase longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Critics argued this would not be an issue if batteries were user-replaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Lawsuits and Fines (2020):** A series of lawsuits concluded in 2020 resulted in Apple being fined or reaching settlements amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Despite these costs, the revenue generated by limiting product lifespan likely pales in comparison to the extra revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Limitations of the Movement
Even if "Right to Repair" laws are enacted, they might not eliminate all forms of artificial obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Manufacturers can still make products seem obsolete through design and styling changes, encouraging consumers to buy newer models due to perceived outdatedness rather than actual technological inferiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The only type of obsolescence that should be supported is [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | technological obsolescence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

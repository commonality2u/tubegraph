Fred Noonan served as the navigator for [[amelia_earharts_final_flight_and_disappearance | Amelia Earhart]] during her attempts to circumnavigate the world by plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. His expertise in navigation was a crucial component of the ambitious journey across vast oceans.

## Navigational Expertise

Noonan's primary role involved calculating the flight plan, which included determining the direction to Howland Island using the onboard compass, air speed, and estimated wind to figure out ground speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. This method is known as dead reckoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. To avoid uncertainty, they would intentionally aim north or south of the target island, then turn confidently towards it after the calculated flight time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

As an independent check on their location, Noonan also employed [[radio_navigation_challenges_in_the_1930s | celestial navigation]], taking measurements of the sun, moon, and stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. He used an almanac listing navigation stars to determine their position by measuring the angle above the horizon and tracing circles of possible locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. This allowed them to continually update their location and adjust their bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. Despite these skills, small errors could accumulate over long trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

## First Attempt and Crew Changes

Noonan was part of Earhart's initial attempt to fly around the world in March 1937, taking off from California heading west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. He was accompanied by another crew member, Harry Manning, who was an expert in radio, Morse code, and traditional navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>. The flight to Hawaii was successful, partly due to Manning using the loop antenna to home in on a radio beacon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>.

However, three days later, as they set off for Howland Island, the plane crashed during takeoff due to a landing gear collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>. The Electra took months to repair, and during this time, Captain Manning left the crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>. This left Noonan as Earhart's sole companion for the subsequent attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>.

## Challenges on the Final Flight

During the July 1937 flight, Noonan's role became even more critical. They faced several challenges related to navigation and communication:
*   **Unacknowledged Headwinds**: Lae radioed Earhart about stronger headwinds just 20 minutes after takeoff, but she never acknowledged the message, likely due to an impaired receiving antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. Knowing the correct wind speed was critical for accurate dead reckoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   **Missed Rendezvous with Ontario**: Earhart and Noonan expected to encounter the Ontario ship nine hours into the flight, but they heard nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. A telegram from Earhart asking the Ontario to transmit Morse code Ns repeatedly did not reach the ship in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>. Since Earhart couldn't communicate with the Ontario, they never sent out signals, preventing Noonan from using the radio direction finding loop to confirm their course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>.
*   **Radio Miscommunications**: Despite Earhart and Noonan being able to transmit voice messages, their ability to receive them was impaired, possibly due to a broken or missing belly antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. Furthermore, the long trailing antenna, crucial for lower frequency Morse code, had been removed after the Hawaii crash, as neither Earhart nor Noonan were particularly well-versed in Morse code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>. This prevented them from sending signals that the Itasca could use to take a bearing on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>.
*   **Time Zone Confusion**: The three parties involved in the rendezvous (Earhart, the Itasca, and Howland Island) were operating on three different time zones, complicating communication schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>.

## Disappearance

In her final desperate messages, Earhart reported being on the line 157-337 and running north and south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>. However, she ran out of fuel somewhere over the Pacific Ocean and crashed into the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>. No trace of Noonan, Earhart, or her Electra has ever been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>.

While Noonan's navigational skills were highly regarded, the combination of equipment malfunctions, communication failures, and lack of certain radio knowledge ultimately hampered their ability to reach Howland Island safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>.

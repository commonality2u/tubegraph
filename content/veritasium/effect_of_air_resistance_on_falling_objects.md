## The Myth of the Deadly Penny

The idea that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could kill someone on the sidewalk below is a popular myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many people believe this story, and led to the observation decks of the Empire State Building being filled with change on ledges below, suggesting people throw pennies over the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

A penny weighs about 2.5 grams, which is roughly half to a quarter the weight of a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. If air resistance were ignored, a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building (443 meters) would accelerate to over 300 kilometers per hour by the time it hit the ground, which is about half the speed of a typical bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

To test this myth, Derek from Veritasium teamed up with original MythBuster Adam Savage to drop pennies from a helicopter onto Derek below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

```ad-warning
No one had ever actually done this experiment from the height of the Empire State Building onto a person below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The experiment was planned for pennies falling through still air, but the helicopter created a significant downdraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
```

When hit by the pennies, Derek reported that they felt like "tiny little bullets" and caused a sting, but were certainly not fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The conclusion was that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building will not hurt significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## The Role of Air Resistance and Terminal Velocity

The reason pennies aren't dangerous when dropped from great heights is due to [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | air resistance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### The Hammer and Feather Experiment

In the near vacuum of the Moon's surface, a hammer and a feather dropped simultaneously accelerate at the same rate due to gravity and hit the ground at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. On Earth, however, the hammer lands much sooner than the feather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The feather quickly reaches a constant speed, known as its [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]], because it stops speeding up as it falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Defining Terminal Velocity

[[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | Terminal velocity]] is the maximum speed an object will reach in free fall through still air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. It is achieved when the force of gravity pulling an object down is equal to the force of air resistance pushing it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

While the feather is clearly affected by drag, the hammer actually experiences a greater force of [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | air resistance]] because [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | air resistance]] is proportional to speed squared and the hammer gets much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, the hammer's weight is so much greater that drag is negligible in comparison, allowing it to continue accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This highlights that it's the ratio of weight to [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | air resistance]] that determines an object's [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Terminal Velocity

*   **Weight and Density**: Objects with the same size and shape experience the same [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | air resistance]]. However, a heavier object of the same size and shape will have a higher [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Size and Shape**: Objects that are very different in size, shape, and weight, like a person and a lacrosse ball, can have the same [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] if the ratio of their weight to [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | air resistance]] is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Altitude/Air Density**: [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | Air resistance]] is directly proportional to the density of the air an object moves through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. At higher [[altitude_effects_on_airplane_efficiency_and_safety | altitudes]] where air is less dense, [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] can be much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   In 2012, Felix Baumgartner jumped from 39 kilometers above sea level, where the air is 60 times less dense than at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. He reached a [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] of over 1300 kilometers per hour, breaking the sound barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. As he fell into thicker atmosphere, his [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Terminal Velocity of Specific Objects

### Pennies

Pennies reach [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] after falling only about 15 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This means that dropping pennies from 15 meters, 300 meters, or 3000 meters would feel the same because they would be traveling at the same speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. For the experiment, the helicopter didn't need to go to Empire State Building height because it wouldn't have increased the penny's speed, only made aiming harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

One of the reasons pennies are hard to aim is their fluttering and tumbling behavior as they fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. A penny actually has two [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocities]] and oscillates between them: one when falling on its face and one on its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Adam Savage demonstrated this phenomenon in a custom wind tunnel that creates a gradient of wind speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The penny oscillates up and down in the tunnel, showing its two [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The maximum [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] for a penny is about 80 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Ballpoint Pens

Some have suggested that ballpoint pens falling from a skyscraper could be lethal due to their more aerodynamic shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. These pens weigh about twice as much as a penny and have a smaller cross-sectional area, which would increase the ratio of weight to drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

An experiment was conducted using a ballistics gel dummy instead of a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. After multiple drops from the helicopter, the plastic pens either missed or landed "cattywampus" (tumbled) and did not show any signs of penetrating the gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. It was concluded that plastic pens are not dangerous falling from tall objects because they have too much drag relative to their weight to achieve a high [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### Bullets

The [[impact_of_object_shape_on_drag_and_terminal_velocity | drag coefficient]] is a dimensionless number that captures how smoothly air flows around an object without creating vortices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Early bullets were spherical (boulettes), with a [[impact_of_object_shape_on_drag_and_terminal_velocity | drag coefficient]] of 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Modern bullet shapes have a [[impact_of_object_shape_on_drag_and_terminal_velocity | drag coefficient]] between 0.1 and 0.3, reducing drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

If a bullet were simply dropped from a skyscraper, it would tumble and likely fall on its side, experiencing far more [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | air resistance]] than its aerodynamic shape would suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Objects tend to fall in the orientation that presents the highest [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | air resistance]] as the most stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Thus, a dropped bullet would be much slower than a shot bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

However, a bullet fired straight up is dangerous if it isn't fired completely vertically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. If it maintains horizontal velocity and spin from the gun barrel, it will continue to move pointy-end first as it falls, allowing it to speed up to a significant fraction of its launch speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Celebratory gunfire from all over the world has caused hundreds of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Historical and Modern Kinetic Projectiles

The concept of dropping deadly projectiles from aircraft is nearly as old as aircraft themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
*   **Fléchettes**: In World War I, small metal darts called fléchettes (French for "little arrow") were dropped from planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. These were designed like nails with feathers to ensure they fell straight and could pierce helmets, causing nasty injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. They were cheap to produce and deploy, and some were up to 15 centimeters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Lazy Dogs**: Later, similar, heftier weapons called Lazy Dogs were used by the US in the Korean and Vietnam wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. While indiscriminate, they did not leave unexploded ordnance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **Modern Kinetic Projectiles**: Militaries continue to use kinetic projectiles today for precision strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

## Real-world Dangers of Falling Objects

[[hazards_of_falling_objects_in_general | Falling objects]] are dangerous in civilian life, leading to nearly 700 American deaths each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. These objects include loose tiles, bricks, construction tools, rocks, tree branches, and even icicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Icicles have been a serious enough concern to cause street closures, such as around New York's One World Trade Center in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Lethality Threshold

The lower limit of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | energy]] required to fracture a human skull is around 68 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Any object with [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] greater than that is very likely to be lethal through blunt force trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

| Object            | [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | Energy]] Delivered (Joules) | Lethality |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------- |
| Raindrop          | 0.002                               | Not lethal |
| Falling Penny     | 0.2                                 | Not lethal |
| Baseball          | > 80                                | Potentially lethal |
| Largest Hailstone | > 80                                | Potentially lethal |

A man was killed in 2014 when hit by a falling measuring tape that had fallen 50 stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. While a falling fléchette's [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | energy]] might not be enough to fracture a skull by blunt force, it can apply a large force to a very small area, causing penetration injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

Ultimately, a penny or a plastic pen falling from the Empire State Building won't be fatal because they are not aerodynamic and weigh only a few grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. However, objects weighing more than a few hundred grams traveling at [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] are likely to be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

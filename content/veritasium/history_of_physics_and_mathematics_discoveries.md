From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

A single, simple rule underpins all of [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | physics]], from classical mechanics to electromagnetism, and from [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum theory]] to general relativity, right down to the fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This rule can replace every principle in [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and may even explain the behavior of life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While some might instinctively favor the local picture of differential equations, it's possible this perspective is "exactly backwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The Brachistochrone Problem

The origin of this unifying principle began with a simple problem: the "problem of fastest descent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This challenge asks what shape of ramp will get a mass from point A to point B in the fastest time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Common sense might suggest the shortest path, a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, bending the ramp down at the beginning allows the mass to accelerate to a higher speed earlier, enabling it to travel faster and beat the straight ramp, even if the path is slightly longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The question then becomes: what shape provides the perfect balance of acceleration and path length to minimize travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>?

Galileo believed the arc of a circle was the answer, showing it was faster than any polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. However, this was not the fastest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Bernoulli's Challenge and Newton's Response

In June 1696, nearly 60 years after Galileo, Johann Bernoulli set this problem as a challenge to the world's best [[history_and_contributions_of_mathematicians_to_perfect_numbers | mathematicians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. He did so partly to show off his own superior abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. He initially gave six months for solutions, but none were submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. His friend, Gottfried Leibniz, persuaded him to extend the deadline, giving "foreigners" a chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The intended target was likely Isaac Newton, whom everyone regarded as the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

On January 29, 1697, Newton, then working as the warden of the Mint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, found Bernoulli's challenge in his mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Despite his irritation at being "dunned and teased by foreigners about mathematical things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, the problem was too enticing. Newton spent the rest of the day and night on it, arriving at a solution by 4:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>—a task that took Bernoulli two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Newton submitted his unsigned solution to *Philosophical Transactions* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, prompting Bernoulli to famously declare, "I recognize the lion by his claw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Although Newton generally dominated Bernoulli, in this instance, Bernoulli's solution was considered superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Fermat's Principle of Least Time

Bernoulli's clever solution drew inspiration from an ancient problem: how does light travel from one place to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>?

Hero of Alexandria, in the 1st century AD, realized that in a single medium like air, light always follows the shortest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This explains why, when light reflects off a surface, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. However, when light moves from one medium to another (e.g., air to water), it refracts and does not follow the shortest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Over 1,600 years, scientists developed Snell's Law, which states that the sine of the angle of incidence divided by the sine of the angle of refraction equals a constant (n) that depends on the two media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, the reason for this law remained unknown until 1657 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Pierre Fermat's Insight

Pierre Fermat, a judge by day and a [[history_and_foundations_of_set_theory_and_mathematics | mathematician]] by night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, became interested in why light obeys the principle of refraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. He theorized that instead of distance, light minimizes *time* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. After initially hesitating due to the complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, five years later he solved it, demonstrating that Snell's Law emerges naturally from the principle of least time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The constant 'n' in Snell's Law is simply the ratio of the speed of light in the first medium to its speed in the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Fermat called this discovery "the most extraordinary, the most unforeseen, and the happiest calculation" of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Fermat's principle was the first time nature was shown to obey an optimization principle, implying that nature "does the best possible thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Bernoulli's Solution: The Cycloid

Bernoulli applied Fermat's principle of least time to the problem of fastest descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. He converted the mechanics problem into an optics problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. He imagined a ray of light that would go faster and faster as it entered layers of less and less dense media, modeling how an object accelerates under gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. By making the layers infinitely thin, a continuous curve emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

The speed of the falling object (velocity) is proportional to the square root of the distance fallen (y) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Plugging this relationship into Snell's Law at each interface reveals a constant ratio: the sine of the angle divided by the square root of 'y' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Bernoulli immediately recognized this constant ratio as the equation of a **cycloid** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>—the path traced by a point on the rim of a rolling wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This curve is also known as a **brachistochrone** (Greek for shortest time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

The cycloid possesses another surprising property: no matter where a mass is released from on the curve, it always reaches the end at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. For this reason, it's also called the **tautochrone** curve (Greek for same time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Bernoulli realized he had solved "two important problems, an optical and a mechanical one," from "entirely separate fields of mathematics," showing them to have "the same character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. He was, unknowingly, on to something much bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Maupertuis and the Principle of Least Action

About 40 years later, Pierre Louis de Maupertuis, one of Bernoulli's students, studied the behavior of light and particles, noting their similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. He questioned whether Fermat's principle of least time was the most fundamental, asking why nature would care about minimizing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. He proposed a more foundational quantity to be minimized, one that would govern both light and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

In the 1740s, Maupertuis introduced "the action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, defined as mass times velocity times distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. His idea was that action increases with distance, velocity, and mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. For a journey with multiple segments, the total action is the sum of the action for each segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Maupertuis claimed that out of all possible trajectories, the path an object follows is the one that minimizes the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. In 1744, he wrote, "This action is the true expense of Nature, which she manages to make as small as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Initial Reception and Criticism

Maupertuis's revolutionary idea was met with ridicule and attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. His friend Samuel Konig accused him of being wrong and stealing the idea from Leibniz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Voltaire, formerly a close friend, accused him of plagiarism and bad [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | physics]], even writing a 32-page pamphlet to mock him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a> (though this may have been influenced by rumors of an affair between Maupertuis and Voltaire's lover) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Maupertuis is rarely mentioned in the [[history_and_contributions_of_mathematicians_to_perfect_numbers | history of mathematics]] and [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

This criticism was partly justified because Maupertuis "just picked" the principle "out of thin air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. There was no obvious reason for nature to minimize mass times velocity times distance, and its mathematical rigor was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Euler's Contributions and Lagrange's Proof

Leonhard Euler vehemently defended Maupertuis's principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. He replaced the sum in Maupertuis's definition of action with an integral, allowing for calculation when speed or direction changed continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Euler used this to find the path of a particle around a central mass, like a planet orbiting a star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This required finding the path with the smallest action out of infinitely many possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. To do this, Euler invented a new, albeit "clunky and time consuming," method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Through this process, he discovered that the principle of least action only works if the total energy is conserved and is the same for all paths considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>—conditions Maupertuis hadn't realized were necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Euler improved the mathematical rigor and provided specific examples of its application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

Despite Euler's advancements, a general proof was still needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This came from Joseph-Louis Lagrange, a shy, mostly self-taught 19-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. In 1754, Lagrange shared his results with Euler, who praised him for having "extolled the theory to the highest summit of perfection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Around five years later, just a year after Maupertuis's death, Lagrange provided a general proof for the principle of least action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### The Euler-Lagrange Approach

To find the path with the least action among infinite possibilities, Euler and Lagrange realized it could be done similarly to finding the minimum of a function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. When finding a minimum, one takes the derivative and sets it to zero; the value of the function doesn't change significantly with a tiny step to the left or right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Similarly, for the path of least action, if a tiny "bump" (a small function `eta`) is added to the path, the action should basically not change, to first order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

This can be compactly written as the variation of the action being equal to zero (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\delta S = 0" title="\delta S = 0" />) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This is the general approach used to solve such problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

## Hamilton's Principle: The Modern Form

Maupertuis's action was the sum of mass times velocity times distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>, which Euler converted to an integral of mass times velocity integrated over distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Through a series of transformations, incorporating the relationship between velocity and time, and the conservation of energy, the action can be rewritten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. If we consider only paths with the same travel time, the principle of least action takes a new form: the variation of kinetic energy minus potential energy, integrated over time, is equal to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

This new way of writing action, where the Lagrangian (kinetic energy minus potential energy, T - V) is integrated over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, was first introduced by William Rowan Hamilton in 1834 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, leading to the principle being named after him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

### Key Differences from Maupertuis's Principle:
*   **Integral over time:** Hamilton's Principle is an integral over time, not space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   **Start and end times:** It requires a start and end point, as well as a start and end time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   **Energy vs. Time:** With Maupertuis's principle, energy must be kept the same, but time can vary. With Hamilton's Principle, energies can differ, but time must be the same between paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

### Equivalence to Newton's Second Law

When Hamilton's Principle is applied to a simple example, like a ball thrown straight up in the air, imagining tiny variations (`eta`) to the true path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>, and solving the resulting equation through [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | calculus]] (using integration by parts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>, the principle of least action is found to be satisfied by the path that obeys F = ma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

In other words, the principle of least action is equivalent to Newton's Second Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

### Unifying Power of the Principle

With this single principle, scientists could suddenly describe everything from light reflecting and refracting to the swinging of a pendulum clock, and planets orbiting the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. What were once viewed as entirely separate fields of [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | physics]] were unified under the simple rule: the variation of the action is zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

Euler wrote to Lagrange, expressing satisfaction that Maupertuis, if alive, would see his principle "applied to the highest degree of dignity to which it is susceptible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

### Practical Advantages of Lagrangian Mechanics

While Newton's Second Law (F=ma) is conceptually simpler, Lagrangian mechanics offers a powerful alternative for solving mechanics problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

The Lagrangian (L = T - V) is plugged into a general differential equation called the Euler-Lagrange equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. This "machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a> automatically cranks out the correct equations of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. It simplifies complex problems because:
*   It works in any number of dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.
*   It allows the use of "weird coordinate systems" better suited to the problem, like polar coordinates for rotational motion, which can be tricky with vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   Problems like the double pendulum, which are "very nasty" to solve using forces, become relatively "easy" with kinetic and potential energy in the Lagrangian approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

## Principle of Stationary Action

The name "principle of least action" can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. Just as setting a derivative to zero in [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | calculus]] doesn't guarantee a minimum (it could be a maximum or an inflection point), the action is not always a true minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. More accurately, it should be called the **principle of stationary action** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>, meaning the laws of motion derive from demanding a stationary point for the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

## Broader Impact

Action is more fundamental than just classical mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. Around the turn of the 20th century, action appeared as a key part of the solution to the UV catastrophe, one of the biggest problems in atomic [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | physics]] at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. Its unexpected appearance in the breakthrough that started [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum theory]] hints at its profound importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

The story of the principle of least action illustrates how knowledge compounds, growing through steady progress until it completely changes how we see the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

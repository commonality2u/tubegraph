For many years, even experienced physicists held the misconception that objects follow a single trajectory through space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, everything in the universe actually explores all possible paths simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The single, well-defined trajectories we observe are, in a way, "the most convincing illusion nature has ever devised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This phenomenon is explained by a fundamental quantity known as "action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## From Least Time to Least Action
The idea that natural phenomena follow an optimal path can be illustrated with a thought experiment: rescuing a friend from drowning at a beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The optimal path to reach them quickly isn't a straight line, but rather a path that accounts for different speeds on land and in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This mathematical relationship is identical to the law governing light's path when passing from one medium to another, where light takes the fastest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Historically, the concept evolved:
*   **Maupertuis's Proposal** In the 18th century, an obscure scientist named Maupertuis proposed an ad hoc quantity called "action," defined as mass times velocity times distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He claimed that everything always follows the path that minimizes this action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Hamilton's Formulation** Later, Hamilton showed that this [[principle_of_least_action | action]] is equivalent to the integral over time of kinetic energy minus potential energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:03:07]</a>. This formulation provided an alternative way to solve physics problems, especially when Newton's laws became cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Action at the Heart of [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | Quantum Mechanics]]
The concept of action became central to [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] around the turn of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, stemming from the problem of blackbody radiation.

### Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe
German scientists in the 1890s sought to maximize visible light from hot filaments for electric lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. They studied how materials emitted light based on temperature, observing that above 500°C, all materials glowed similarly with an almost identical distribution of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:12]</a>.

To understand this theoretically, they imagined a "perfect blackbody" – a hole in a metal cube that absorbs all light and perfectly emits radiation based on its temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:47]</a>. Theorists reasoned that electrons in the walls would emit electromagnetic waves, forming standing waves inside the cavity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:45]</a>.
Classical theory, specifically the Rayleigh-Jeans law, predicted an "ultraviolet catastrophe" – an infinite amount of energy emitted at the shortest wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:38]</a>. This contradicted experimental data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Planck's Quantum Hypothesis
Max Planck solved this problem in 1900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:53]</a>. In an "act of desperation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:47]</a>, he proposed that energy could only be emitted in discrete multiples of a smallest amount, a "quantum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:15]</a>. He linked the energy of one quantum directly to its frequency with the formula E = hf, where 'h' is [[plancks_constant_and_its_role_in_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:21]</a>. This "quantization" explained why fewer atoms could emit high-frequency (short-wavelength) radiation, causing the spectrum to fall to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:24]</a>.

Planck initially viewed this as a mathematical trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:50]</a>, but his constant 'h' had the units of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:31]</a>. He later proposed that any change in nature would occur in whole multiples of this quantum of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:46]</a>.

### Further Developments in [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | Quantum Mechanics]]
*   **Einstein and Photons** In 1905, Albert Einstein asserted that Planck's theory implied light actually comes in discrete packets, or "photons," each with energy E=hf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:20]</a>. He used this to explain the photoelectric effect, where electrons are ejected from metal only when light frequency is high enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Bohr's Atomic Model** Niels Bohr applied the idea of quantization in 1913 to explain atomic stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:46]</a>. He quantized the electron's orbital angular momentum (which has the same units as action), stating it could only exist in discrete units of h-bar (h/2π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:38]</a>. This ad hoc assumption correctly predicted the energy levels of the hydrogen atom and its spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **De Broglie's Matter Waves** Louis de Broglie, in his PhD, proposed that if light could be both a wave and a particle, then matter particles (like electrons) could also be waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:40]</a>. He defined their wavelength as [[plancks_constant_and_its_role_in_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] divided by their momentum (mass times velocity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:59]</a>. This meant that for an electron to be bound in an atom, it must exist as a standing wave, requiring a whole number of wavelengths to fit around the orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:15]</a>. This naturally led to Bohr's quantized angular momentum condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:51]</a>, providing a physical reason for the quantization.

## Feynman's Path Integral: Exploring All Paths
The wave nature of quantum objects means they do not follow a single path through space; instead, they explore all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:13]</a>.

Richard Feynman, using an analogy involving infinite slits, demonstrated this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:17:08]</a>. In a double-slit experiment, where an electron could go through either slit, [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] dictates it must go through both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:16:02]</a>. The probability of finding a particle at a point on the screen is found by adding the amplitudes of the wave from each slit and squaring the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:09]</a>. Feynman's insight was that if you extend this to infinite screens, each with infinite slits, it implies that light or particles traveling through empty space must be exploring all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:18]</a>.

This means that when a particle moves from one point to another, "you have to consider all the possible paths it could take to get there, including ones that go faster than the speed of light, including ones that go back in time, and including ones that go to the other side of the moon and back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:18:09]</a>. Each of these paths is included in the calculation, weighted equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:21]</a>.

### The Role of Phase and Interference
So why do we only see a single, classical path?
*   Each path has an associated "phase," which determines the amplitude of the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:48]</a>.
*   As a particle wave follows a path, its phase increases, causing a vector (representing amplitude) to rotate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:08]</a>.
*   The total increase in phase for a path is directly proportional to the "classical [[principle_of_least_action | action]]" of that path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:31]</a>.
*   [[plancks_constant_and_its_role_in_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] (h-bar) is incredibly tiny (around 10^-34 joule-seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:46]</a>. This means that for everyday objects, even slightly different paths result in drastically different actions, causing their phases to spin around zillions of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:24:20]</a>.
*   When the phases of these "crazy paths" are added up, they point in random directions and largely cancel each other out through destructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   The exception is for paths extremely close to the path of least action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:42]</a>. For these paths, tiny changes do not significantly alter the action, so their phases point in almost the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:57]</a>. These paths constructively interfere, leading to the single, observable trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:25:03]</a>.

### Experimental Demonstration
The concept that all paths are explored can be demonstrated experimentally. A diffraction grating, essentially a mirror covered in many tiny strips, can cause light to reflect at angles it normally wouldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:46]</a>. By covering up sections of the mirror, the destructive interference from certain paths is removed, allowing other paths to constructively interfere and be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:42]</a>. This effect is visible even with a laser, showing that light *does* explore all paths, but most of these alternative paths cancel out under normal circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:31:07]</a>.

## Action in Modern Physics
The [[principle_of_least_action | principle of least action]] is not merely a mathematical trick; it's a fundamental aspect of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:16]</a>. It explains how classical mechanics emerges from [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:28]</a>. Massive particles, with their large actions compared to [[plancks_constant_and_its_role_in_quantum_mechanics | h-bar]], have paths so narrowly concentrated around the least action path that they appear very particle-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:49]</a>. Smaller particles like electrons or photons have smaller actions, leading to a greater spread in their possible trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:58]</a>.

The concept of action is incredibly important in modern theoretical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:33]</a>. Theoretical physicists often focus on the Lagrangian (which leads to the action) rather than forces or energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:45]</a>. The search for a "theory of everything" is essentially a quest to find the correct Lagrangian that can generate all the laws of physics in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:45]</a>.

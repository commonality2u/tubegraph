Super glue is a powerful adhesive, capable of supporting significant weight from a single drop once set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A square patch of super glue five centimeters on a side could suspend a fully grown African elephant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## [[History and discovery of super glue | History and Discovery]]

In 1942, during World War II, the Eastman Kodak Company sought a clear plastic for gun sights that could be cast instead of ground like glass lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Chemist Harry Coover worked on a compound called cyanoacrylate, which seemed promising but had an "unfortunate tendency" to stick to everything, a trait Coover described as a "severe pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Kodak ultimately abandoned this search during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

By 1951, Coover resumed work on developing a clear plastic, this time for jet plane canopies, hoping to solve the stickiness of cyanoacrylate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. During an experiment, Coover's coworker, Fred Joyner, inadvertently smeared cyanoacrylate between two prisms for a refractive index test, despite Coover's warnings not to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Joyner discovered he couldn't pull the prisms apart, leading him to believe he had ruined the refractometer, which was worth nearly $10,000 adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Instead of anger, Coover had a "flash of insight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. He began gluing together various materials like glass, rubber, metal, wood, and paper, observing that "Everything stuck to everything almost instantly and with bonds I could not break apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This discovery led him to name the compound Eastman 910 Adhesive, as it was the 910th substance tested in the company's research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Today, it is widely known as super glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## [[Chemical properties and bonding mechanism of super glue | Chemical Properties and Bonding Mechanism]]

Super glue, in its liquid form, consists of identical monomer molecules, specifically ethyl cyanoacrylate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. When applied between two surfaces, the liquid flows into pores and crevices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The monomers then react, forming long polymer chains that transform the glue from a liquid to a solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This solidification within the surface irregularities prevents the glue from being pulled out, connecting the two surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The reactivity of ethyl cyanoacrylate stems from its molecular structure, which has two double bonds and one triple bond close together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. A double bond attached to a nitrile group and an ester group makes the carbon in that double bond electron deficient, or "hungry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

In the presence of a negative ion, the carbon double bond breaks, forming four single bonds. The electronegative nitrile and ester groups pull an extra electron across the molecule, making the carbon negative, which then attracts another slightly positive carbon on a separate monomer, initiating a chemical link and forming a polymer chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This single initiator starts a rapid chain reaction, with more monomers bonding to form longer chains until the super glue solidifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This process typically takes between 10 and 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

The polymerization of super glue is primarily triggered by water, specifically the slightly negative oxygen atoms and negative hydroxide ions in water molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Water is ubiquitous, present as moisture in the air, on most surfaces, and absorbed into materials like fabrics, which is why super glue sets rapidly on almost anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Applications

### General Adhesion
Super glue bonds almost anything, including plastic, rubber, metal, wood, and paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Its first industrial sale in 1956 was to Mason and Hanger, who used it to assemble atomic bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### Forensic Science
A forensic technique uses super glue fumes to retrieve fingerprints from non-porous surfaces. This works because human hands leave behind moisture and oils that super glue readily binds with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### [[Medical uses and developments of super glue | Medical Applications]]
Harry Coover recognized super glue's medical potential after it instantly sealed a cut on his son's finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He envisioned a glue that could replace sutures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

Initially, three problems needed to be addressed for medical use:
1.  **Heat Release**: The formation of bonds releases heat, which can irritate a wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
2.  **Toxicity**: Over time, super glue in the body breaks down into toxic chemicals like formaldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
3.  **Brittleness**: Super glue is hard and brittle, unlike flexible living tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

These issues were solved by increasing the number of carbons in the alkyl chain of the cyanoacrylate molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>:
*   Longer carbon chains slow the reaction rate, reducing heat release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   Longer polymers break down much more slowly, allowing wounds to heal before toxins are released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.
*   Slower reactions allow for longer, more flexible polymer chains that can absorb stress better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

Coover submitted an application to the FDA for medical superglue in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. The US military developed a medical super glue spray for the Vietnam War, which saved lives by sealing wounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Despite its battlefield success, regulatory delays meant Coover's medical glue, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (Dermabond), wasn't approved until 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The medical super glue industry is now valued at $900 million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

### [[Potential of super glue for plastic recycling | Plastic Recycling Potential]]
Scientists are exploring cyanoacrylate's use as a plastic to address the plastic pollution problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. Unlike other plastics that degrade when mechanically recycled, super glue polymers can be heated to 210 degrees Celsius to break down into pure monomers, which can then be distilled and reactivated into fresh polymer, offering a sustainable recycling solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. This process yields an average of 93% monomer recovery, a significant improvement over traditional plastic recycling which often results in downcycled, lower-quality materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

## Limitations and Weaknesses

### Brittleness
Super glue polymers are mostly linear single chains, densely packed with some cross-linking, making the polymer rigid and about as hard as a hard hat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. While strong in compression and tension (when pulled in the same direction as the chains), super glue is brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Sudden impact causes it to fall apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Rapid polymerization often produces short polymer chains with built-in stress, creating potential failure points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Unlike flexible plastics like polyethylene or polypropylene, super glue's rigid chains cannot deform to absorb impact, causing bonds to physically break and the material to fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Shear and Peel Forces
Super glue is weak when force is applied perpendicular to its polymer chains, a condition known as shear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Shear force, a combination of compression and friction, is not evenly distributed but is highest at the edges, leading to bond failure because super glue's brittleness prevents stress redistribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
Peeling a super glued surface from one end concentrates all the force on a few polymers, causing the chains to break one by one, like a zipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

### Non-Bonding Materials
Super glue will not bond to "chemically inert" materials that lack reactive sites, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and Teflon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. These materials are hydrophobic and non-porous, preventing water (an initiator) from activating the glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This property is crucial for containing and storing super glue without it setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Modifying Super Glue

### Thickening Agents
Pure ethyl cyanoacrylate is very runny, similar to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Thickening agents, such as fumed silica, are added to create gel-like super glues by forming branched structures that increase viscosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Inhibitors
Acids are often added to super glue to inhibit premature polymerization inside the tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Accelerators
To speed up super glue's setting time, more negative ions (initiators) can be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Commercial accelerators are available, but many DIYers use baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), which reacts with air moisture to produce hydroxide ions, rapidly setting the glue and forming a hard composite substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Layering super glue and baking soda can strengthen joints, fill gaps, and even allow for drilling or sanding after setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. While baking soda solution dramatically speeds polymerization, creating continuous polymer strands, the resulting plastic is often fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]]]$.

### Slowing Polymerization
For underwater applications, slowing down the polymerization reaction is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Gel cyanoacrylates, with their thickeners, naturally slow the reaction, allowing sufficient time to apply and detach objects underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

For its use as a [[Potential of super glue for plastic recycling | recyclable plastic]], modifications are needed to overcome the brittleness and handling issues. This involves:
*   **Weak Bases**: Using a very weak base, like DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), provides enough initiators to start polymerization slowly, resulting in longer polymer chains and a nice solid plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Solvents**: A solvent, such as acetone, dilutes the conditions and provides additional mobility, allowing polymers to form longer, more stable chains before solidifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. After setting, the acetone evaporates, leaving the new plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

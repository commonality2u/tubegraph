The Navy's Indoor Ocean at Carderock is the world's largest wave pool, designed to test scale ships and improve their designs before deployment in open waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The facility can generate various wave types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> and is described as an "indoor ocean" due to its appearance and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Facility Dimensions and Features
The pool is 360 feet long in one dimension, 240 feet long in another, and 20 feet deep, approximately the size of a football field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The dome above the pool was once the largest freestanding dome globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Wave Generation and Control
Waves are created using 216 individual wave makers, which are huge paddles lining two walls of the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These paddles can generate waves from -45 degrees up to 135 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The key differentiator of this facility is its precise [[wave_pool_engineering_and_control | control]] over wave generation, allowing for reproducible waves of specific amplitude and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Air bellows facilitate the angular motion of the paddles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Fundamental Wave Characteristics
*   **Wavelength**: The distance from one wave crest to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Energy Transmission**: Waves primarily transmit energy, not material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Water molecules move along circular paths as the wave travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Wave Base**: All water motion stops at a depth equal to half the wavelength, known as the wave base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Molecule Drift**: In an ideal water wave, molecules drift slightly in the direction of wave motion because they travel faster at the top of their loop than they move backward at the bottom, creating a spiral path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Wave Frequency and Speed
The frequency of a wave affects its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. High-frequency waves travel slower than low-frequency waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. If the water is deeper than the wave base, wave speed is inversely proportional to its frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This principle allows engineers to send out high-frequency waves first, followed by lower frequencies, causing the slower high-frequency waves to be caught up by the faster low-frequency waves, culminating in a breaking wave when they meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Superposition and Interference
The principle of superposition states that when waves meet, their amplitudes add together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Breaking Waves**: Combining multiple waves can create a significantly larger breaking wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Standing Waves**: Sending two regular waves towards each other creates standing waves, sometimes referred to as a "quilt wave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. In standing waves, certain points have zero amplitude (cancel out), while others have maximum amplitude (add up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Bullseye Wave**: Waves can be sent from all directions to form circular wave fronts that converge at a single point, channeling all wave energy into that "bullseye" spot, causing a wave to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Ship Testing and Scaling
The primary purpose of the facility is to replicate diverse ocean wave conditions to test model ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Model ships, scaled down versions of billion-dollar vessels, are placed in the pool to observe their behavior in various conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling Factors**:
    *   The pool uses fresh water, so models must account for the buoyancy difference compared to salty ocean water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   For accurate wave dynamics, scaling is based on the Froude number, which measures the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   If a model ship's hull is 46 times smaller than the real ship, its speed should be 1/√46 times the real-world speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   Footage from the model is slowed down by a factor of √46 (roughly 6.8 times) to visually match full-size ship behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Measurement**: Ultrasonic sensors in a large array measure wave height, period, and direction within the basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Model Testing**: Models can be free-running on a "race track" to correlate headings to full-scale vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, or tethered to a carriage for "captain model tests" where they are towed through waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Ocean Wave Formation
Most ocean waves are generated by wind, particularly strong winds in and around storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Factors Affecting Waves**: Five factors influence the size and shape of waves:
    1.  Wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
    2.  Wind duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>
    3.  Fetch (the distance over which the wind acts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>
    4.  Width of the fetch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>
    5.  Depth of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>

### Types of Ocean Waves
*   **Swell**: As waves travel away from a storm, higher-frequency waves dissipate energy more quickly. The fast-moving, low-frequency waves that travel long distances are called swell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Swell, with its long wavelength, is generally not a concern for ships in the open ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Rogue Waves**: These are typically not single, anomalous waves but rather multiple waves meeting and adding together (superposition) to create an amplitude significantly larger than individual waves, leading to breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Wind Waves**: Formed in three steps:
    1.  Turbulent air motion from wind creates tiny ripples (wavelengths around a centimeter) on still water due to slight pressure differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
    2.  Wind acts on these ripples, creating larger pressure differences that pull them into bigger waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
    3.  Interaction between wind and waves leads to even larger pressure differences and waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. As waves interact, they create a range of wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Fully Developed Sea**: When energy dissipation from breaking waves matches the energy input from the wind, waves reach their maximum size, defining a fully developed sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Irregular Waves (Spectra)**: Unlike regular waves with one frequency and amplitude, irregular waves are characterized by a "spectra" of multiple frequencies and amplitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## [[ocean_and_wave_conditions_in_different_regions | Ocean and wave conditions in different regions]]
Different oceans and bodies of water exhibit distinct wave spectra due to their geography and storm types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>:
*   **North Sea and small bodies of water**: Tend to have a peakier spectrum due to the limited fetch of storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Mid-Atlantic**: A broader spectrum best describes the developing or decaying open ocean waves found there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **North Atlantic**: Steady winds across an open ocean produce the broadest spectrum of wind waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

Engineers must identify the appropriate wave spectra for a ship's deployment location to accurately test its design in the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. For example, conditions off South Korea in spring can be very rough, while crossing the Pacific might be calmer, and the Arabian Gulf presents yet another set of conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. The amount of water washing onto a ship's deck, particularly on helicopter landing pads, is a critical test parameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Innovation in Ship Design
Despite ships being built for thousands of years, innovation continues, especially in hull design for properties like stealth and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Model testing in facilities like the Indoor Ocean allows for cost-effective experimentation with new designs, such as the "tumble home" hull, which has different restoring forces compared to traditional flared hulls, influencing a ship's stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Every ship in the U.S. Navy's fleet has undergone testing or review at this facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

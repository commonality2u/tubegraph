Radiation, particularly [[types_and_effects_of_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]], is defined as radiation with sufficient energy to strip electrons from atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It is measured in units called Sieverts (Sv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Exposure to more than two Sieverts all at once is described as likely fatal shortly after exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. However, humans are continuously exposed to low levels of [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Natural and Everyday Radiation Exposure

Many common items and environments expose individuals to low levels of [[types_and_effects_of_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]]:
*   **Bananas** Bananas are rich in potassium, some of which is naturally radioactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Eating a banana exposes a person to approximately 0.1 microSieverts (µSv) of radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Human Proximity** Sleeping next to another person can result in more radiation exposure than sleeping alone, though the dose is insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Earth's Background Radiation** There is natural background radiation originating from soil, rocks, air, and even space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The global average level of radiation is typically between 0.1 and 0.2 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Comparison of Radiation Exposure in Various Scenarios

[[comparison_of_radiation_exposure_in_different_scenarios | Radiation exposure varies significantly]] depending on location and activity:
*   **Hiroshima, Japan** Nearly 70 years after the first nuclear bomb detonation over a city, the radiation level near the Peace Dome is only 0.3 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Marie Curie's Lab and Uranium Mine**
    *   An old uranium mine, where uranium was discovered and Marie Curie sourced her raw material, showed levels of 1.7 µSv per hour, about 10 times the natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   In Marie Curie's lab, some areas remain radioactive. A doorknob measured around 10 times the background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The back of her chair still emits alpha particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Trinity Bomb Test Site, New Mexico** The site of the world's first nuclear bomb test currently has a radiation level of about 8 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The unique glass-like mineral formed by the heat of the bomb, called trinitite, measures two or three µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Air Travel** [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | Airplanes]] expose passengers to higher radiation due to reduced atmospheric shielding from [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]] at altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   18,000 feet: up to 0.5 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>
    *   23,000 feet: up to 1 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>
    *   33,000 feet: over 2 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>
    *   Even higher altitudes and towards the poles: over 3 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
*   **Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor Site**
    *   In 2014, the area around the melted down Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four read around 5 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Staying for one hour would result in a similar dose to a dental X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This relatively lower level is partly due to the removal of several meters of topsoil from the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
    *   The basement of the hospital in Pripyat, where contaminated firemen's clothing was stored after the Chernobyl accident, was measured as one of the most radioactive places visited. Readings just outside the door reached 500 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, and inside, 1,500 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. An hour in the basement would yield 2,000 µSv, equivalent to a year's worth of natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Fukushima Exclusion Zone** Three years after the accident, radiation readings in the Fukushima exclusion zone ranged from 5 to 10 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Although the release of radioactive material was only about 10% of Chernobyl's, it is much "fresher," meaning less has decayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Japanese authorities are also removing contaminated topsoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. People living around Fukushima are estimated to receive an additional 10,000 µSv over their lifetime due to the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Medical Procedures**
    *   A single dental X-ray is comparable to one hour spent at the Chernobyl site (5 µSv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   A CT scan exposes a patient to approximately 7,000 µSv, equivalent to three years of natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Radiation Workers** In the US, radiation workers are limited to a maximum exposure of 50,000 µSv per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Astronauts** An [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | astronaut]] on the International Space Station for six months receives about 80,000 µSv of radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Health Risks Associated with Smoking

Despite the significant radiation levels in specific environments or occupations, the highest doses of [[health_risks_associated_with_pfas_exposure | ionizing radiation]] are, on average, received by the lungs of a smoker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

A smoker's lungs annually receive an average of 160,000 µSv of radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This is due to the presence of radioactive polonium and radioactive lead found in the tobacco they smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Beyond exposure to carcinogens and toxins, smokers also receive very high levels of radiation from their habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

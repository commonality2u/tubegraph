Dark matter is hypothesized to constitute 85% of all matter in existence, potentially forming a "shadow universe" five times more massive than everything visible to us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. According to most theories, dark matter is thought to interact with nothing, including itself, except through gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Evidence for Dark Matter's Existence

The hypothesis of dark matter arose from observations that could not be explained by visible matter alone.
*   **Galactic Clusters:** In 1933, Fritz Zwicky observed galaxies in the Coma Cluster moving faster than expected, suggesting more unseen matter was pulling them inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This led him to propose the existence of "dunkle materie," or dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This is a key part of the [[history_of_dark_matter_hypothesis | history of dark matter hypothesis]].
*   **Galactic Rotation Curves:** Forty years later, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford observed that stars in the Andromeda Galaxy maintained an almost constant rotational velocity regardless of their distance from the center, rather than slowing down further out as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Without additional mass, these stars should be flung into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Similarly, Albert Bosma found the same constant rotational velocity for hydrogen gas even further out from galaxy centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   One explanation for this is the existence of invisible dark matter, which holds these galaxies together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This suggests that roughly 85% of a galaxy's mass is dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   An [[alternative_theories_to_dark_matter | alternative theories to dark matter]] is to modify the theory of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) suggests a limit to how low acceleration can go, rather than an additional force from dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. However, the consensus heavily favors dark matter as a physical substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Bullet Cluster:** The Bullet Cluster, formed from the collision of two galaxy clusters, provides strong evidence for dark matter's distinct interaction properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
    *   Most ordinary mass in these clusters is interstellar gas, which interacted, heated up, and slowed down during the collision, accumulating in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Gravitational lensing measurements show that most of the mass is on either side of the collision, not in the middle where the gas is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
    *   This is best explained by dark matter passing directly through the collision without interacting, thus creating gravitational lensing where the least ordinary matter is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This highlights its non-interacting nature with ordinary matter.
*   **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** The oldest light in the universe, the CMB, also provides evidence for dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   The pattern of temperature differences in the CMB, when graphed by blob size, shows peaks whose heights depend on the amount of dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   To match CMB measurements, a universe needs about five times as much dark matter as ordinary matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This figure is consistent with observations from galactic rotation and cluster dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Searching for Direct Interaction

While dark matter primarily interacts via gravity, scientists are hopeful for some level of interaction to enable direct detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The prevailing hypothesis for these [[dark_matter_detection_experiments | dark matter detection experiments]] focuses on "Weakly Interacting Massive Particles" (WIMPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. WIMPs are expected to be roughly the mass of a proton but interact very weakly with ordinary matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### DAMA/LIBRA Experiment

Located under a mountain in the Italian Alps, the DAMA/LIBRA detector has collected data for approximately 20 years, showing peculiar periodic results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The rate of detections peaks in June and reaches a minimum in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Proposed Explanation:** This annual signal could be due to Earth's motion through a sphere of dark matter permeating our galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. As the Solar System moves at 220 km/s through the galaxy, Earth's orbit around the Sun (30 km/s) means it moves faster through dark matter for half the year (peaking in June) and slower for the other half (slowing in November) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The idea is that more dark matter is encountered when moving fastest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty:** The signal might also be attributed to mundane environmental factors like temperature, humidity, or snow, all of which fluctuate annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. A significant problem for DAMA/LIBRA is that other similar experiments have found no such signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### New Experiment in the Southern Hemisphere

To resolve the DAMA/LIBRA uncertainty, an almost identical experiment is being built one kilometer underground in a gold mine outside Melbourne, Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Experimental Design:** In the Southern Hemisphere, seasons are reversed, but Earth's motion through dark matter remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. If the same annual signal is observed, it would be strong evidence for dark matter's existence and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Interaction Principle:** The core of the detector uses seven-kilogram crystals of pure sodium iodide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. The idea is that very rarely, a dark matter particle (WIMP) might hit a nucleus in the crystal and transfer its energy, creating a flash of light (scintillation) detected by sensitive photomultiplier tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Mitigating Background Noise:**
    *   **Radioactivity:** To filter out scintillations caused by radioactive potassium in the crystals, they are submerged in 12 tons of liquid scintillator (linear alkylbenzene) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. If light is detected simultaneously in both the crystal and the tank, it's likely a potassium decay, not a dark matter event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
    *   **Cosmic Rays:** To eliminate interference from muons generated by cosmic rays, detectors are located deep underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. At one kilometer underground, the number of muons is reduced by approximately a million times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Muon detectors are also placed directly above the tank to rule out any remaining muon-related flashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
    *   **Mine Radioactivity:** To combat radon gas from radioactive elements in the mine walls, the cavern is coated with special paint, crystals are bathed in pure nitrogen gas, and the entire detector is shielded by 120 tons of steel and plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## The Nature of Dark Matter Interaction

The current understanding suggests that dark matter's primary interaction is gravitational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. However, for direct detection experiments to succeed, there must be some level of weak interaction between dark matter and ordinary matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

> "If God gave me the great book of physics and there were two sections, section A and section B, one for the luminous matter and one for dark matter, and they didn't talk to each other, I would say that was a very peculiar universe." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>

Given that dark matter constitutes 80% of the universe's mass, it's speculated that it might not be just one particle but an entire "dark standard model" or something even more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

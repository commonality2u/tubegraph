Antivenom, also known as antivenin, is a crucial medical treatment used to neutralize the effects of venom from snake and spider bites, ultimately saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The scientific development of antivenom has a fascinating history, building upon observations of immunity and advancements in understanding toxicology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Historical Discoveries
The concept of immunity to venom was first observed by British military doctor Edward Nicholson in Burma in 1870 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. He noted that local snake handlers would intentionally allow cobras to bite them in a practice he called "tattooing," seemingly to develop an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Nicholson observed that older handlers were less affected by accidental bites compared to younger ones, suggesting this dangerous practice conferred some protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Two decades later, in Saigon, French medical researcher Albert Calmette explored the possibility of creating a vaccine for snake bites while working on smallpox vaccinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Back in Paris, Calmette conducted experiments by injecting rabbits with tiny, gradually increasing doses of cobra venom over eight months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Initially, rabbits received as little as 0.03 milligrams, but eventually tolerated 35 milligrams—15 times the normal lethal dose—remaining healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This demonstrated that the rabbits' immune systems produced antibodies to neutralize the venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

Calmette then reasoned that it would be more practical to administer antibodies after a bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. He drew blood from a venom-resistant rabbit, isolated the serum (which contains antibodies), and injected it into another rabbit that had never been exposed to venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. When this second rabbit was injected with twice the lethal dose of cobra venom, it remained unharmed, proving that immunity could be transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This marked the creation of the first antivenom, which Calmette termed "antivenin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## Modern [[antivenom_production_process | Antivenom Production]]
Today, antivenoms are largely produced using similar methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. At facilities like the Australian Reptile Park, venom is collected from snakes and spiders through a process called "milking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This venom is then frozen and sent off to be diluted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

The diluted venom is injected into a donor animal, typically a horse, chosen for its large size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Over several months, increasing doses of venom are administered, allowing the horse to build up immunity and produce antibodies against the venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Blood is then drawn from the horse, and the plasma containing the antibodies is isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The red blood cells are returned to the horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. These horse antibodies form the life-saving antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

The effectiveness of horse antibodies in humans stems from our [[evolutionary_aspects_of_snake_venom | shared evolutionary history]] with other mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Horse antibodies are similar enough to human antibodies that they can effectively bind to and neutralize toxic compounds in our bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Venomous Snakes and Production Yield
The Australian Reptile Park houses some of the most toxic snakes on the planet, including the second, third, fourth, fifth, and roughly twelfth or thirteenth most toxic species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. To maximize venom production for antivenom, snakes are selectively bred to produce more venom than their wild counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. For example, some captive coastal taipans produce five to seven times the amount of venom a wild one would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. A single vial of antivenom may require venom from approximately 15 snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Characteristics of Snake Venom
Snake venom evolved from saliva and is primarily used for catching and digesting prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Each snake species possesses a unique venom composition tailored to its specific prey animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Originally, venom was squirted into a snake's mouth by rear teeth, and nearly two-thirds of all snakes today remain rear-fanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The venom gland is situated behind the snake's eye, making a direct downward duct to the back of the top jaw the shortest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Over time, [[evolutionary_aspects_of_snake_venom | evolutionary pressures]] caused fangs to migrate to the front of the jaw, improving hunting efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Fangs also evolved from smooth teeth, with venom flowing down the outside, to grooved fangs that channeled venom, and eventually to hollow tubes that literally inject venom into prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. While only one-seventh of the world's snakes have hollow fangs, almost all venomous snakes in Australia possess them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Venom Toxicity
The concept of the "most venomous snake" is complex because venom potency is specific to a snake's usual prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. For example, a honey badger is almost entirely immune to Cobra venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The lethality of a bite depends on the snake, the bitten animal, and the amount of venom injected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Scientists often test venom potency on lab mice to estimate the amount of antivenom needed to neutralize a bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. One King Cobra bite contains enough venom to kill 13,000 mice, or an estimated four human-sized rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. By this measure, the inland taipan, found in central Australia, is considered the most venomous snake in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. A single bite from an inland taipan can kill half a million mice, or over 100 humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Snake venom is particularly lethal to humans because we are closely related to rodents, a primary prey for many snakes, sharing similar biology such as cell structure, blood clotting mechanisms, and nerve signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Venoms often target molecular pathways highly conserved across vertebrates, or even across the entire tree of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Types of Venom Effects
Snake venom can kill through four main mechanisms:
*   **Neurotoxic:** Damages the nervous system and brain by interfering with neurotransmitters, the signaling chemicals between neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Hemotoxic:** Thins blood, prevents wound healing, and causes internal bleeding by disturbing blood coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Cytotoxic:** Attacks cells, leading to severe blisters, necrosis, and cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Myotoxic:** Destroys muscles and causes paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Most venoms contain a complex combination of neurotoxic, hemotoxic, cytotoxic, and myotoxic proteins, with up to 200 compounds in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This multifaceted nature makes [[snake_venom_and_human_safety | snake bites]] incredibly difficult to treat, as dozens of toxins work together to cause harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Directions
Despite its life-saving capabilities, the current method of [[antivenom_production_process | antivenom production]] has drawbacks:
*   **Danger:** Collecting venom is a perilous process, as evidenced by handlers like Zac, who was hospitalized for 36 hours after a mere scratch from a snake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Donor Animals:** The process involves many donor animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Allergic Reactions:** Some individuals, like Zac, are highly allergic to antivenom itself, which can lead to anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline treatment alongside antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

Scientists are exploring alternative methods for antivenom production, such as using genetically modified bacteria to produce the specific antibodies needed to neutralize each toxin in a venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. However, for now, the traditional method remains the primary way antivenom is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

In Australia, snake bites lead to only one to three fatalities per year due to effective antivenom products and a federally funded program that provides antivenom for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates snake bites cause 120,000 deaths annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The dedication of individuals like Zac, who work with these dangerous animals, plays a vital role in saving countless lives worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

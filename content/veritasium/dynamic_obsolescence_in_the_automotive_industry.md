The concept of obsolescence, particularly through design and marketing, has significantly shaped the automotive industry. This approach aims to encourage consumers to frequently purchase new products, even if their current ones are still functional.

## Henry Ford's Vision
In 1908, Henry Ford introduced the Model T, the first mass-market car, intending it to be an affordable, durable tool that would not wear out, similar to an "everlasting light bulb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Ford stated in 1922, "We want the man who buys one of our cars never to have to buy another, we never make an improvement that renders any previous model obsolete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## The Shift Towards Obsolescence
By 1920, 55% of American families already owned a car, indicating market saturation among those who could afford one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. That same year, a small economic downturn impacted sales for both Ford and General Motors (GM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

In 1921, DuPont, a chemical and paint company, acquired a controlling share in General Motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. DuPont began experimenting with painting cars in various colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, a stark contrast to Henry Ford's policy that customers could have any color "so long as it's black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. After a couple of years of testing, GM released its first cars in different colors in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

### Introduction of Dynamic Obsolescence
Soon after introducing varied colors, GM implemented a strategy of annually introducing cars with different colors and styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The objective was not only to make Ford's Model T appear outdated but also to make GM's own cars feel outdated each year, prompting customers to trade in their older models for new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

Harley Earl, GM's head of design, candidly referred to this strategy as "dynamic obsolescence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. He stated, "Our big job is to hasten obsolescence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Earl noted that the average car ownership span decreased from five years in 1934 to two years by 1955, aspiring for it to reach one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. By the time Earl made these remarks, General Motors was the world's most valuable company, selling half of all vehicles purchased in the US annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Legacy and Parallels
This strategy of [[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | planned obsolescence]] through design and styling has been adopted by modern companies. The world's most valuable company, Apple, has been observed to follow a similar playbook, introducing new styles, special colors, and marginal technological improvements annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

The inspiration for this approach in industries like automotive and tech originates from the fashion industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. In fashion, where true innovation is difficult, the primary method to drive sales is to create styles designed to last only one season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. When styles are exhausted, they are recycled from previous decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This cyclical design trend, where "there is no best, there's only different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, serves to remind consumers they lack the "latest and greatest," encouraging continuous purchasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Ultimately, the preferred form of obsolescence is technological innovation, which brings genuine improvements to products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Almost eight years prior to the publication of the explanatory video, a channel created a video demonstrating that cutting a grape nearly in half and placing it in a microwave could generate plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. At that time, the explanation for this phenomenon was incomplete, and "nobody really knew how this effect worked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Scientific Explanation Uncovered

As of the video's publication, [[scientific_studies_on_plasma_generation_with_microwaves | three scientists have published an explanation]] in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Their research involved high-speed cameras, thermal cameras, and electromagnetic modeling to provide a comprehensive explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The scientists demonstrated that a grape is not strictly necessary; the same effect can be achieved with [[comparison_of_microwave_interaction_with_grapes_and_hydrogel_beads | hydrogel water beads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These tiny polymer beads expand significantly, up to 100 times their volume, when soaked in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## How Microwaves Interact with Grapes

A typical household microwave operates at approximately 2.45 gigahertz, resulting in a microwave wavelength of about 12 centimeters in air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. While a grape is much smaller than 12 centimeters, the crucial factor is the wavelength *inside* the grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | refractive index]] of grape material in the microwave regime is almost 10, significantly higher than its visible light refractive index (around 1.33) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This high refractive index means microwaves travel about ten times slower through the grape than through air, reducing their wavelength inside the grape to approximately 1.2 centimeters, which is roughly the size of a grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

When a single grape is placed in a microwave, the microwaves become trapped inside due to its high refractive index and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This trapping occurs when the diameter of the ball is approximately the same as the microwave wavelength within the material, similar to total internal reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The trapped microwaves form resonant modes or standing waves, where the maximum electromagnetic field is concentrated at the center of the grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Consequently, the grape heats from the inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### The Role of Two Grapes

When two grapes are placed close enough to touch, their electromagnetic fields interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The greatest electromagnetic field concentration, and thus the highest heating, occurs at the contact point between the two grapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. It's not necessary to cut the grapes in half; two whole grapes placed side-by-side will produce the effect as long as they maintain contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. A watch glass is often used in demonstrations to keep the grapes together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Plasma Formation

The intense electromagnetic fields at the intersection of the grapes cause sparks and breakdown of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The electric fields are strong enough to ionize the air, leading to the creation of plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. These newly created ions can then absorb more energy from the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The plasma pulses at 120 Hertz, twice the 60 Hertz frequency of mains power, reflecting the amplitude of the microwaves pulsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Analysis of the plasma's spectrum revealed strong potassium and sodium emission lines, indicating that these ions, common in grapes, are sprayed into the air when the plasma forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Size and Absorption Considerations

The size of the grapes is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. While water absorbs microwaves, this absorption actually helps broaden the range of sizes that will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If the material did not absorb microwaves, extreme electromagnetic field amplification would only occur at very specific sizes. However, with an absorbent material like water, the peaks broaden, leading to less amplification but over a wider range of sizes, which is why various grape sizes can still produce the effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Potential Applications

Beyond being a fun trick, this research has potential applications, particularly in [[potential_applications_in_lithography_and_microchip_fabrication | lithography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The phenomenon demonstrates that two spheres of the correct size and refractive index can focus electromagnetic energy into a tiny spot between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. In the case of grapes, this focuses radiation with a 12-centimeter wavelength down to about a millimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If similar focusing could be achieved with light, it could significantly improve current lithography techniques used in microchip fabrication, potentially allowing for much smaller features and continuing Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

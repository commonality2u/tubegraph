For years, the phenomenon of creating plasma by microwaving a grape was observed, but its scientific explanation remained elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. As of the publication of this video, three scientists have published a detailed explanation in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This [[scientific_study_on_microwaving_grapes|scientific study on microwaving grapes]] utilized high-speed cameras, thermal cameras, and electromagnetic modeling to uncover the underlying physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Experiment

Initially, the effect was observed by cutting a grape almost completely in half and placing it in a microwave oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, the recent research demonstrated that a grape doesn't even need to be cut; the same effect can be achieved by placing two whole grapes close together so they are in contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The phenomenon can also be replicated with hydrogel water beads, which are tiny polymer beads that expand significantly when soaked in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. A watch glass is often used to keep the grapes in contact during the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## The Science Behind Plasma Formation

### Microwave Wavelength and Refractive Index
A typical household microwave operates at an electromagnetic radiation frequency of approximately 2.45 gigahertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This translates to a microwave wavelength of about 12 centimeters in air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While a grape is much smaller than 12 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, the crucial factor is the wavelength *inside* the grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The [[index_of_refraction_and_microwaves_behavior_in_grapes|index of refraction]] for grape material in the microwave regime is significantly high, almost 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This means microwaves travel about ten times slower through the grape than through air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, reducing their wavelength to about 1.2 centimeters—roughly the size of a grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Microwave Trapping and Resonant Modes
When a single grape is placed in a microwave, the microwaves become trapped inside it due to its high refractive index and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This phenomenon, similar to total internal reflection, occurs because the grape's diameter is roughly the same as the microwave wavelength within the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Once trapped, the microwaves form resonant modes, or standing waves, inside the grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. In a single grape, the maximum electromagnetic field strength is located at the center, causing the grape to heat from the inside out, rather than the outside in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Focusing Energy and Plasma Ignition
When two grapes are placed close enough to touch, their electromagnetic fields interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The greatest electromagnetic field strength occurs at the contact point between the two grapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This is where the grapes get hottest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

The extremely strong electromagnetic fields at the intersection point can ionize the air, causing sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This ionization is the initial step in creating plasma, as the electric fields are strong enough to break down the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. These created ions then absorb more energy from the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The plasma can be observed pulsing at 120 Hertz, which is twice the 60 Hertz frequency of mains power, reflecting the amplitude pulsing of the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Spectroscopic analysis of the grape plasma reveals strong emission lines for potassium and sodium, indicating that these ions, common in grapes, are sprayed into the air when the plasma forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Factors Affecting the Phenomenon

The size of the grapes is important for this effect to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. However, grapes do not need to be an exact size due to water's ability to absorb microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Modeling shows that if the material did not absorb microwaves, extreme electromagnetic field amplification would occur at very specific sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. But because grapes are made of an absorbent material like water, this effect broadens the peaks, allowing for less amplification but over a wider range of sizes. This [[explanation_of_electromagnetic_fields_and_grape_size|explanation of electromagnetic fields and grape size]] is why various grape sizes can still produce plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Potential Applications

Beyond being a curious trick, this research has potential applications in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The phenomenon demonstrates how two spheres of the correct size and refractive index can focus electromagnetic energy into a tiny spot between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In this case, it can focus radiation with a 12-centimeter wavelength down to about a millimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

If similar focusing capabilities could be achieved with light, it could significantly improve [[potential_applications_for_electromagnetic_energy_focus_in_lithography|lithography techniques]] used in microchip fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This advancement could allow for the creation of much smaller features, potentially enabling the continuation of Moore's Law—the trend of increasing the number of transistors on a single chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Potential in Medicine

Super glue, chemically known as [[chemical_properties_and_bonding_mechanism_of_super_glue | cyanoacrylate]], showed early promise for medical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Its ability to instantly seal wounds was first noticed by chemist Harry Coover, who applied it to his son's accidentally cut finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:53">[16:00:53]</a>. The cut instantly sealed shut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. Coover immediately recognized its potential to completely replace sutures in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.

## Challenges for Medical Application

Despite its adhesive strength, several problems had to be addressed for [[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | super glue]] to be suitable for living tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>:

1.  **Heat Release:** As [[chemical_properties_and_bonding_mechanism_of_super_glue | super glue]] sets, the formation of bonds releases heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. On a cotton ball, this can cause temperatures to rise dramatically, even causing smoke and reaching over 120 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. While less dramatic on skin, it could still irritate a wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Toxicity:** Over time, [[chemical_properties_and_bonding_mechanism_of_super_glue | super glue]] in the body breaks down into toxic chemicals like formaldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Brittleness:** Standard [[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | super glue]] is hard and brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. For living tissue, an adhesive needs to be soft and flexible to accommodate movement during the healing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>.

### Solutions to Medical Challenges

Remarkably, Coover and his team found that all these problems could be solved by a single chemical modification: increasing the number of carbons in the alkyl chain of the [[chemical_properties_and_bonding_mechanism_of_super_glue | cyanoacrylate]] molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.

*   **Slower Reaction Rate:** Longer carbon chains slow down the rate at which monomers bind, reducing the heat released all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.
*   **Slower Breakdown:** Longer polymers break down much more slowly, allowing wounds enough time to heal before toxins are released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Flexibility:** A slower reaction allows monomers more time to form longer polymers, which can absorb stress better and make the glue more flexible without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>.

## Military and Battlefield Applications

The US military was highly interested in Coover's adhesive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. They developed a medical [[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | super glue]] spray for use in the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. This spray was credited with saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>. In one notable case, a soldier with severe internal bleeding from a bullet wound to the kidney and liver, who had received 12 liters of blood, had the bleeding stopped instantly when surgeons sprayed [[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | super glue]] directly onto his liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>. He recovered as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

## FDA Approval and Modern Industry

Despite its battlefield success, medical [[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | super glue]] faced years of bureaucratic delays in the FDA approval process, leading Coover to abandon the project for a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. His dream of an approved medical glue was finally realized in 1998 with the approval of Dermabond, a 2-octyl [[chemical_properties_and_bonding_mechanism_of_super_glue | cyanoacrylate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>. Today, the medical [[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | super glue]] industry has grown to be a $900-million-a-year business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>.

## Accidental Adhesion to Skin and Eyes

[[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | Super glue]] is exceptionally good at sticking to skin because skin has many wrinkles and pores for the glue to seep into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Additionally, the protein collagen in skin has negative regions that can initiate the polymerization reaction and bond directly with monomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. This makes skin an ideal surface for the glue to stick to, and it's why it's so difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. Some of your molecules literally become part of the polymer chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Removing Super Glue from Skin

In a medical case study, a person got [[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | cyanoacrylate]] all over their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. Washing with soap and water accelerated the polymerization, sticking their hands together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. After receiving ineffective advice and attempts at physical separation, someone finally suggested acetone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. Acetone, or nail polish remover, dissolved the glue and released their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

### Super Glue in Eyes

Unfortunately, some [[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | super glue]] bottles are similar in appearance to eyedrop bottles, leading to hundreds of cases of people accidentally putting [[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | super glue]] directly into their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

> [!warning] **Do not use acetone in eyes.**
> If [[super_glue_applications_and_limitations | super glue]] gets into the eyes, acetone is not the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Do not attempt to separate the eyelids; seek medical attention immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

Mathematics initially served as a tool to quantify the world, measuring land, predicting planetary motions, and tracking commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, a problem considered impossible—the cubic equation—challenged these traditional applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Its solution required separating math from the real world, distinguishing algebra from geometry, and inventing new numbers, now known as [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Ironically, these [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]] later became central to our most advanced physical theories of the universe, suggesting that abandoning a direct connection to reality was key to understanding reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Early Mathematical Approaches and the Quadratic

In 1494, Luca Pacioli, who was Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, published "Summa de Arithmetica," a comprehensive summary of all known mathematics in Renaissance Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This work included a section on the cubic equation (ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0), concluding that a general solution was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This was surprising, as quadratics (equations without the x³ term) had been solved thousands of years earlier by many ancient civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Ancient mathematicians typically approached problems through words and pictures rather than equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. For example, to solve x² + 26x = 27, they would visualize x² as a literal square with sides of length x, and 26x as a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The technique of "completing the square" involved cutting the 26x rectangle in half (into two 13x rectangles) and positioning them around the x² square to form an almost complete larger square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. By adding a 13x13 square (169) to both sides, the equation transformed into (x+13)² = 196, leading to x = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Despite its visual utility, this geometric approach was incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. For thousands of years, mathematicians disregarded negative solutions because they dealt with tangible quantities like lengths and areas, for which negative values made no sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Their aversion to negative numbers was so strong that there were six different versions of the quadratic equation, all arranged to ensure positive coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Similarly, in the 11th century, Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam identified 19 distinct cubic equations, maintaining positive coefficients and seeking solutions through intersections of shapes like hyperbolas and circles, but he could not find a general solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## The Breakthroughs in Renaissance Italy

### Scipione del Ferro's Secret Discovery
Around 1510, Scipione del Ferro, a mathematics professor at the University of Bologna, discovered a method to solve "depressed cubics"—cubic equations without an x² term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Instead of publishing his finding, he kept it secret to secure his job, as mathematicians in the 1500s often competed in "math duels" for positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Del Ferro only revealed his secret on his deathbed in 1526 to his student, Antonio Fior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### The Duel: Fior vs. Tartaglia
Fior, less talented but ambitious, boasted about his ability to solve depressed cubics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This led to a challenge on February 12, 1535, against Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia in Venice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Tartaglia, a self-taught mathematician who overcame poverty and a childhood injury that left him with a stutter (earning him the nickname "Tartaglia," meaning stutterer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, suspected Fior's claim. With his livelihood at stake and knowing a solution was possible, Tartaglia independently developed his own method for depressed cubics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

Tartaglia extended the idea of completing the square into three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For an equation like x³ + 9x = 26, he visualized x³ as a cube and needed to add 9x volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. By extending the cube's sides by a distance 'y', he created a larger cube (z³) composed of the original x³ cube, three rectangular prisms (x by x by y), three narrower prisms (x by y by y), and a small y³ cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. By rearranging the six rectangular prisms into a block with volume 3yzx, he could set 3yz = 9 (where z = x + y). Completing the cube by adding y³ to both sides yielded z³ = 26 + y³ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This resulted in a y⁶ + 26y³ = 27, which, by treating y³ as a new variable, became a solvable quadratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This method led to y = 1, z = 3, and ultimately x = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

Tartaglia's understanding allowed him to solve all 30 of Fior's depressed cubics in just two hours, while Fior failed to solve any <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. To streamline his process, Tartaglia summarized his method not as equations (as modern [[evolution_of_algebraic_notation | algebraic notation]] didn't exist yet) but as a poem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Cardano's "Ars Magna" and the Full Cubic Solution
Tartaglia's victory made him a celebrity, attracting the attention of Gerolamo Cardano, a polymath from Milan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. After persistent efforts, including flattery and threats, Cardano lured Tartaglia to Milan, where Tartaglia, on March 25, 1539, revealed his method under a solemn oath of secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Cardano immediately began experimenting with Tartaglia's algorithm and made a crucial discovery: any general cubic equation could be transformed into a depressed cubic by substituting x with (x - b/3a), causing the x² terms to cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This meant Tartaglia's formula could solve *any* cubic equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

Eager to publish, but bound by his oath, Cardano found his loophole in 1542 when he visited del Ferro's son-in-law in Bologna. There, he discovered del Ferro's original notes, which contained the solution to the depressed cubic, predating Tartaglia's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Seeing this as justification, Cardano published "Ars Magna" (The Great Art) three years later, a comprehensive work on mathematics, including a unique geometric proof for each of the 13 cubic arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Although he acknowledged Tartaglia, del Ferro, and Fior, Tartaglia was enraged, leading to a public feud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. To this day, the general solution to the cubic is often referred to as Cardano's method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## The Emergence of Imaginary Numbers

While writing "Ars Magna," Cardano encountered cubic equations like x³ = 15x + 4, whose solutions, when plugged into the algorithm, yielded square roots of negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. When he sought Tartaglia's advice, he was dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Cardano's geometric derivation of a similar problem led to a paradox: a part of a square that needed to have an area of 30 but sides of length 5, requiring the addition of "negative area" to complete the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This was the source of the square roots of negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Previously, the appearance of square roots of negative numbers (e.g., when trying to find two numbers that add to 10 and multiply to 40) was understood as a mathematical indicator that no *real* solution existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, the cubic x³ = 15x + 4 clearly had a real solution (x = 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Cardano, unable to reconcile this, avoided the case in "Ars Magna," calling the idea of square roots of negatives "as subtle as it is useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Bombelli's Contribution to Imaginary Numbers
About ten years later, Italian engineer Rafael Bombelli tackled this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Undeterred by the "impossible geometry," he observed that the square root of a negative "cannot be called either positive or negative" and designated it as its own new type of number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Bombelli assumed the terms in Cardano's solution could be expressed as combinations of ordinary numbers and this new type, involving the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. He found that the two cube roots in Cardano's equation were equivalent to 2 ± the square root of negative one. When these terms were added, the square roots cancelled out, leaving the correct real answer, 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:17:01]</a>. This demonstrated that Cardano's method *did* work, but only by temporarily abandoning the geometric proof and allowing "negative areas" as an intermediate step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact on Modern Physics

The next hundred years saw the birth of modern mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. In the 1600s, Francois Viete introduced the [[evolution_of_algebraic_notation | modern symbolic notation for algebra]], ending the tradition of wordy descriptions and drawings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Geometry was no longer the sole source of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Rene Descartes popularized the square roots of negatives, calling them "[[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]]," a name that persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Later, Euler introduced 'i' to represent the square root of negative one, forming [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | complex numbers]] when combined with real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. The cubic equation's solution led to the invention of these new numbers, liberating algebra from its geometric constraints and creating a more powerful mathematics capable of solving real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

The significance of [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]] extended far beyond algebra. In 1925, Erwin Schrödinger developed the Schrödinger equation to describe the behavior of quantum particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Prominently featured within this fundamental equation was 'i', the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This surprised physicists, including Schrödinger himself, who found the use of [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | complex numbers]] "unpleasant" in a theory of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

The presence of 'i' is crucial due to the unique properties of [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]]. They exist on a dimension perpendicular to the real number line, forming the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Repeated multiplication by 'i' results in rotations of 90 degrees in this plane (1 → i → -1 → -i → 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The function e^ix embodies these rotations, spreading them along the x-axis to create a spiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. The real part of this spiral is a cosine wave, and the imaginary part is a sine wave, meaning the quintessential wave functions are contained within e^ix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

Schrödinger naturally assumed solutions to his wave equation would resemble e^ix, specifically e^(ikx - ωt), because its derivative with respect to position or time is proportional to the original function, a property not shared by simple sine or cosine functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Furthermore, the linearity of the Schrödinger equation allows for the addition of arbitrary numbers of these exponential solutions to create any wave shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. As physicist Freeman Dyson noted, "Schrödinger put the square root of minus one into the equation, and suddenly it made sense. Suddenly it became a wave equation instead of a heat conduction equation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The Schrödinger equation accurately describes atomic behavior and forms the basis of chemistry and most of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Its reliance on the square root of minus one implies that nature fundamentally operates with [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | complex numbers]], a discovery that surprised everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

Thus, [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]], initially conceived as a quirky intermediate step in solving the cubic equation, proved to be fundamental to our description of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. By letting go of a direct, tangible connection to reality in mathematics, a deeper truth about the universe could be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

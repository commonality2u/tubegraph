The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) offers a different way to understand [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] by proposing that there is no "collapse" of the wave function upon measurement. Instead, every possible outcome of a quantum event is realized in its own separate universe, leading to a "multiverse" [0:56].

## The Problem with Traditional Quantum Mechanics

In classical mechanics, knowing a system's state (like a particle's position and velocity) allows one to calculate its future behavior using equations like Newton's second law [0:05]. Similarly, in [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]], knowing a particle's [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] allows calculation of its future behavior using the Schrödinger equation; typically, it spreads out over time [0:16]. This suggests a beautiful symmetry where an initial state evolves smoothly and continuously into the future [0:36].

However, a core problem arises because in [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]], the spread-out [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] is never directly observed. Instead, measurements consistently find a particle at a single point in space [0:46]. The founders of quantum theory initially considered the measurement more real than the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] because measurements are observable and align with our experience of a world composed of matter particles [1:07].

### The Born Rule and Determinism

Erwin Schrödinger formulated his wave equation because scientists, notably Louis de Broglie, suspected that matter possessed wave-like properties [1:26]. It was Max Born who proposed how to interpret the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]]: by taking its complex amplitude (a real plus an imaginary number) and squaring it, one obtains the probability of finding the particle at that point [1:36]. This "Born rule," though initially a footnote in Born's paper, introduced probability into the fundamental picture of reality [1:57]. This philosophical leap meant the universe was no longer considered [[Quantum mechanics and deterministic universe | deterministic]], a concept that made many scientists, including Einstein, uncomfortable [2:07]. Nevertheless, the Born rule remains central to [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] due to its success in predicting experimental outcomes [2:17].

### The Two Rules

The traditional understanding of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] operates under two sets of rules [2:26]:
1.  **Evolution**: When not being observed, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] evolves smoothly according to the Schrödinger equation [2:32].
2.  **Collapse**: When a measurement is made, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] suddenly and irreversibly collapses, with the probability of any outcome given by the squared amplitude of its associated [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] [2:35].

## Schrödinger's Cat and its Implications

Schrödinger himself disliked this two-rule formulation, which led him to devise the famous [[Schrodingers cat thought experiment | Schrödinger's cat thought experiment]] [2:51].

> [2:57] Put a cat in a box with a radioactive atom and a radiation detector that triggers the release of poisonous cyanide gas.
>
> If the atom decays, the detector detects radiation, releases the poison, and the cat dies [3:29]. If the atom doesn't decay, the cat remains alive [3:35]. The state of the cat and detector are directly tied to the state of the atom, meaning they are [[Superposition and entanglement | entangled]] [3:42].
>
> According to traditional [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]], the atom can be in a [[Superposition and entanglement | superposition]] of both decayed and not decayed states simultaneously, assuming no measurements are made [3:51]. This [[Superposition and entanglement | superposition]] then [[Superposition and entanglement | entangles]] with the detector and the cat [4:04]. Consequently, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of everything inside the box is in a [[Superposition and entanglement | superposition]] of the cat being alive and the cat being dead at the same time [4:13]. Only when the box is opened and a measurement is made does the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapse, and the cat becomes definitively either dead or alive [4:31].

Schrödinger used this thought experiment to demonstrate what he saw as the absurdity of the collapse postulate, aiming to show that the traditional formulation of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] was wrong [4:46].

## The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)

MWI proposes a "better way to think about [[Schrodingers cat thought experiment | Schrödinger's cat]]" and [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] as a whole, arguing it is more logical and consistent [4:56]. This interpretation examines the three essential components of [[Schrodingers cat thought experiment | Schrödinger's cat]]: [[Superposition and entanglement | superposition]], [[Superposition and entanglement | entanglement]], and measurement, to identify any flaws [5:07].

### Foundations of MWI

*   **[[Superposition and entanglement | Superposition]] is well-established**: The double-slit experiment demonstrates that individual electrons can pass through both slits simultaneously, producing an interference pattern [5:26]. This is consistent with electrons being represented by a [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] when not observed [6:04].
*   **[[Superposition and entanglement | Entanglement]] is fundamental**: When particles interact, they no longer have separate [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave functions]] but are described by a single, shared [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] [7:09]. Measuring one [[Superposition and entanglement | entangled]] particle instantaneously affects the state of the other, even if light-years apart, because the single [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapses [6:58]. Rigorously, there is only one [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]]—that of the entire universe [7:30].
*   **Measurement is interaction**: The problematic "measurement postulate" was added to connect the mathematics of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] to observations [8:11]. However, measurement itself is just the interaction of one quantum system with another, which should also be governed by the Schrödinger equation [8:30].

### How MWI Resolves the Collapse Problem

MWI discards the ad-hoc rules associated with measurement [8:44]. In the [[Schrodingers cat thought experiment | Schrödinger's cat]] scenario, the radioactive atom's [[Superposition and entanglement | superposition]] entangles with the detector, then the cat, and crucially, with the observer as well, since humans are also quantum mechanical systems [8:50].

> [9:07] When we open the box, there is no measurement, no [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapse. We simply get [[Superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with the state of everything inside the box. So we see the cat alive and we see the cat dead.

The solution to simultaneously observing contradictory outcomes is that the "you" who saw the cat alive and the "you" who saw it dead inhabit separate, non-interacting worlds [9:26].

This branching of the universe occurs through **environmental decoherence** [9:51]. When a quantum object in [[Superposition and entanglement | superposition]] [[Superposition and entanglement | entangles]] with its environment (e.g., air molecules, photons), the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of the universe branches, splitting into slightly different copies [9:56].

A more realistic account of [[Schrodingers cat thought experiment | Schrödinger's cat]] under MWI:
1.  The radioactive atom enters a [[Superposition and entanglement | superposition]] of decayed and not decayed [10:09].
2.  The detector becomes [[Superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with this state [10:17].
3.  The detector, being bombarded by environmental particles, [[Superposition and entanglement | entangles]] with the environment and undergoes decoherence, branching the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] into two [10:23].
4.  At that moment, the observer is split into two identical copies, each [[Superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with one outcome [10:43].
5.  Upon opening the box, each "you" simply finds out what happened in their branch; the cat is definitively alive or dead in that specific branch. The other outcome also occurred, just to an observer who is no longer *you* [10:52].

### Key Characteristics of MWI

*   **Formulated by Hugh Everett**: This interpretation of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] was developed by Hugh Everett [11:12].
*   **Constant Branching**: The branching of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] happens continuously, potentially infinitely often [11:18]. For example, radioactive nuclei in the human body decay thousands of times per second, causing constant branching [14:04].
*   **Mathematical Consistency**: All these worlds are a natural part of the mathematics of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]]; MWI simply takes them seriously [11:30]. Eliminating them would require an artificial mechanism like [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapse [11:38].
*   **Deterministic Universe**: The universe, in the MWI, goes back to being [[Quantum mechanics and deterministic universe | deterministic]]. Every outcome occurs 100% of the time across the multiverse; we only perceive a single outcome because we experience only our "sliver" of reality [12:15].
*   **Elegance**: The formalism of MWI is simpler and more elegant, relying solely on [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave functions]] evolving under the Schrödinger equation [11:50]. The [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] is considered the complete picture of reality, with our measurement being just a small fraction of it [12:00].
*   **Not everything happens**: Many-worlds does not imply that absolutely everything that *could* possibly happen *does* happen. The Schrödinger equation still governs which outcomes have zero probability (e.g., an electron converting into a proton would violate conservation laws) [14:52].
*   **Branches as Human Convenience**: The concept of "branches" or "worlds" is a convenient human description of the universe's [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]], not an inherent feature of reality itself. The [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of the universe is all that truly exists [18:01].

While the number of worlds and the frequency of branching are unknown, the total number of branches is "joy mungus by any stretch" [13:44]. The details of how many branches exist may depend on unresolved questions in [[unification of physics theories | quantum gravity and cosmology]] [14:43].

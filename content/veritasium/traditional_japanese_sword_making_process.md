Traditional Japanese sword making is a meticulous and time-consuming process that has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Every step is done by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, resulting in swords considered among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These swords are renowned for being strong and sharp enough to slice a bullet in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Their historical and artistic value is immense; one 16th-century sword was appraised at $105 million, making it the most expensive sword ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

While [[history_of_japanese_swords | sword making in Japan]] dates back about 3,000 years to bronze swords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, the shift to steel occurred 1,200 years ago during the Heian period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This is when the iconic curved steel blade, most people recognize as a Japanese sword, emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Raw Materials: Iron Sand

Steel is an alloy of iron, the fourth-most common element in Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Unlike most of the world's iron supply, which comes from banded iron formations, Japan's mostly volcanic geology means it has barely any of these sedimentary iron oxides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This likely explains why Japan was late to steel production, importing metals until the 8th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Instead, Japan relies on [[iron_sand_collection_and_smelting_in_japan | iron sand]], which is derived from igneous rocks like granite and diorite that contain iron oxides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. As mountains weather, these oxides break apart and wash downstream, eventually becoming part of the sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Japanese artisans observed that because iron oxides are denser, they accumulate where rivers change direction or speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. To enhance this, they deliberately created diversions in rivers, like damning off a section and dragging sand into it, allowing the heavier iron to be left behind while lighter material washed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This method can yield iron sands with up to 80% iron oxides by weight, making it an excellent source for high-quality steel with fewer impurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Smelting: The Tatara Method

The process of smelting iron sand into steel is known as the [[iron_sand_collection_and_smelting_in_japan | Tatara method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. It is still carried out in the Shimane province of Japan in a smelter lit for only one night each year, in the same way it was 1,300 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Only steel made this way is used in the best Japanese swords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The process begins with ceremonial prayers and the lighting of the fire by a Shinto priest around 9:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Workers remain at the smelter for at least 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

To obtain pure iron, iron oxides must be heated to over 1,250 degrees Celsius to break the bonds with oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This is achieved using charcoal, which is essentially pure carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Adding a small amount of carbon to iron creates the incredibly strong alloy: steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Alloys are stronger than pure metals because different sized atoms reduce the ability of atoms to slide past each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Charcoal and iron sand are continuously added to the smelter. The iron sand is mixed with water to prevent it from flying straight up when added to the flame; however, too much water risks the kiln exploding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This precise water mixture is done by feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

High temperatures (up to 1,500 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>) are maintained by a strong, steady supply of oxygen, traditionally provided by huge foot-operated bellows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Today, electric bellows are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

The iron inside the smelter does not melt but becomes soft and malleable enough to clump into a large block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Impurities like sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon oxides combine with carbon from the charcoal, melting at a lower temperature than iron, and flow to the bottom as slag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Slag is periodically removed from the bottom of the smelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

After about 24 hours of smelting, which involves adding hundreds of kilograms of charcoal and iron sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, the process is complete. The traditional method required breaking the smelter apart, but today a crane is used to disassemble it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. The result is a 100-kilogram block of steel, iron, and slag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Only about a third of this block is high enough quality for sword making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The steel is then sorted by quality and carbon content, often done by eye, which is part of a swordsmith's certification exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Forging the Sword

Sorted steel is sent to swordsmiths, one of whom is Akihara Kokaji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The forging begins by heating the steel in a coal oven with hand-pumped bellows until it's soft and malleable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The master swordsmith then flattens the steel using hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Traditionally, this involved the swordsmith and three apprentices, with the master setting the rhythm for the apprentices' large mallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Today, electric hammers are often used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

Once flattened, the steel is bent back on itself and hammered again to press it into a solid block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This [[steel_alloying_and_sword_forging_techniques | folding process]] serves two crucial purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>:
1.  **Spreading Impurities**: It spreads out impurities like silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus throughout the steel, ensuring uniform consistency and preventing weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
2.  **Creating Grain**: It gives the steel a grain, reinforcing the sword in the direction it will be hit in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

As a bonus, the steel's exposure to air during folding creates a small amount of oxidation, which, when folded, results in beautiful patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Each fold doubles the number of layers, so a typical sword folded 10 to 13 times results in a few thousand layers of steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

A blade is not made from a single block of steel because carbon content affects hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Higher carbon content makes steel harder and more rigid but also more brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Swordsmiths use steel with different carbon contents for different parts of the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>:
*   **Edge**: High-carbon steel for hardness and rigidity, maintaining a sharp edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Spine**: Lower-carbon steel for flexibility, preventing the sword from breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
These different steel pieces are welded together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

## Quenching and Curving

After being hammered into a straight blade, the sword is covered in a layer of clay: thick for the spine and thin for the blade's edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. It's then heated in the furnace and rapidly cooled in water, a process known as quenching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

Due to the varying clay thicknesses, the edge cools faster than the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   **Spine**: Cools slowly, allowing carbon atoms to leave the iron matrix, forming ferrite and cementite, which combine into perlite (mostly soft and ductile steel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   **Edge**: Cools rapidly, trapping more carbon in the lattice. This forces the lattice structure to change to tetragonal, creating martensite, an incredibly hard form of steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

The tetragonal lattice structure of martensite also takes up more space, causing the blade's edge to expand relative to the spine, curving the sword backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The iconic curve of a samurai sword thus comes from the formation of martensite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. The boundary between these different steel types is visible in a finished sword as a difference in color, known as `hamon` (edge pattern) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

During quenching, about one-third of all blades shatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. After quenching, the sword is returned to the forge to evaporate any remaining water, which also loosens some crystal structures, making the sword less brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Finishing: Polishing and Sharpening

Once forged, the sword is sent to a polisher. Polishing and sharpening are also done by hand using whetstones of different coarsenesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. This meticulous process can take a month for a single sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Occasionally, swords are also engraved with beautiful patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Significance and Artistry

The creation of a traditional Japanese sword is a testament to immense care, attention, and expertise at every step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. From gathering and refining iron sand to smelting, forging, and sharpening, each stage demands significant time and skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. It is remarkable that these methods were discovered through trial and error, yielding artifacts of such high quality that they are still prized centuries later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. The process highlights the [[artistry_and_craftsmanship_in_japanese_swords | artistry and craftsmanship]] inherent in sword making, transforming a weapon into a work of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

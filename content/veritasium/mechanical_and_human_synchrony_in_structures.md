The second law of thermodynamics suggests that the universe tends towards disorder, with chaos being the norm in complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, instances of [[spontaneous_order_and_synchronization_in_nature | spontaneous order]], such as the synchronization of metronomes, perfectly timed moon orbits, simultaneous firefly flashes, and even the regular beating of a heart, can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These phenomena raise questions about what imposes order despite nature's tendency towards disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Millennium Bridge Wobble

Upon its opening, the Millennium Bridge in London began to wobble back and forth as crowds filled it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Despite restricting access, the wobble persisted, leading to the bridge's full closure two days later for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This unexpected behavior stemmed from a phenomenon related to human movement and structural resonance.

### Historical Precedent: Broughton Suspension Bridge

It has long been known that armies should break step when crossing bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This practice dates back to an incident in 1831 when 74 men of the 60th Rifle Corps marched across the Broughton suspension bridge in northern England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The bridge collapsed under their synchronized footsteps, resulting in 60 men falling into the river and 20 sustaining injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Following this, the British Army ordered all troops to break step when crossing bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The Millennium Bridge incident was puzzling because the pedestrians were random members of the public, not an organized army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Christian Huygens' Discovery of Coupled Oscillators

To understand the bridge's behavior, we look back 350 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. In 1656, Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens created the first working pendulum clock to help sailors determine longitude at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. His pendulum clocks were accurate to 10-15 seconds per day, a significant improvement over contemporary clocks that were out by around 15 minutes a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

While testing an arrangement of two clocks, which he planned to attach to a heavy hanging mass on a ship, Huygens made a remarkable discovery in February 1665 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. He hung two pendulum clocks from a wood beam across chairs and observed that after about half an hour, they would [[spontaneous_order_and_synchronization_in_nature | spontaneously synchronize]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. As one swung one way, the other swung the opposite way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. He tried disturbing them, setting them out of sync, but they returned to lockstep within 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Huygens initially thought air currents caused this "strange sympathy," but placing a board between them did not prevent the synchronization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. He eventually realized the clocks synchronized because they were hung from the same wood beam <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The beam transferred mechanical vibrations from one clock to the other, making the two oscillators coupled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Huygens was the first to observe this kind of [[spontaneous_order_and_synchronization_in_nature | spontaneous synchronization]] in inanimate objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Principles of Synchronization: The Metronome Demonstration

A common demonstration involves placing several metronomes on a light, wobbly platform and starting them out of sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Despite having slightly different natural frequencies, they eventually beat in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

When two metronomes oscillate in sync, their large masses accelerate to the left, pushing the platform to the right, and vice versa, keeping the system's center of mass roughly stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. If a third metronome starts out of sync, the platform's motion gives it a kick every half swing, speeding it up until it synchronizes with the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This works regardless of the number of metronomes, as the platform moves in the direction of the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### The [[kuramoto_model_and_synchronization_theory | Kuramoto Model]]

The position of an oscillator, like a metronome pendulum, can be represented as a point on a circle, showing its phase within its cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The higher the oscillator's frequency, the faster its point moves around the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. When oscillators are synchronized, their points move around the circle together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

This concept is used in the [[kuramoto_model_and_synchronization_theory | Kuramoto model]], a mathematical model for synchronizing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The model states that the rate each point (oscillator) moves around the circle equals its natural frequency plus an amount related to its distance from other points, determined by the "coupling strength" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Analogously, if two friends run on a track, a faster friend might encourage a slower one to speed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If the "coupling" (their friendship and effort) is strong enough, they can synchronize their speeds, overcoming their natural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Otherwise, one will start lapping the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## [[spontaneous_order_and_synchronization_in_nature | Synchronization]] in Nature

[[spontaneous_order_and_synchronization_in_nature | Synchronization]] is a universal phenomenon occurring at every scale of nature, from subatomic to cosmic, utilizing all communication channels like gravitational, electrical, chemical, and mechanical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Fireflies

Fireflies in Southeast Asia synchronize their flashes, even though each has its own preferred flashing frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Their strong coupling allows hundreds or even thousands to flash together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. In simulations, even small, close-range interactions (where a flash nudges a neighbor's internal clock forward) can lead to waves of synchronized flashes and eventually, all fireflies flashing at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Tidal Locking of Moons

Our Moon is tidally locked to Earth, meaning it rotates on its axis exactly once for every orbit around Earth, which is why we only see one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This is a common effect in our solar system, with 34 moons tidally locked to their planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

The process involves the planet's stronger gravitational attraction on the side of the moon closer to it, distorting the moon into an egg shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. As the moon orbits and rotates, these bulges swing out of alignment, and the gravitational force constantly pulls them back, slowing the moon's rotation until it locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. If the moon initially rotates too slowly, the same mechanism can speed it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Beyond tidal locking, Jupiter's three innermost moons (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) are in a 1:4 orbital resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. For every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice, and Io orbits four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### [[synchronization_in_chemical_and_biological_systems | Synchronization in Chemical and Biological Systems]]: The Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) Reaction and the Heart

In the 1950s, Russian chemists sought a chemical reaction that would oscillate like a chemical pendulum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Although thermodynamics suggests closed systems tend towards equilibrium (increasing entropy), there's no principle preventing oscillatory damping to equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Boris Belousov and Anatol Zhabotinsky discovered such a reaction, now known as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This reaction can oscillate between colors for half an hour or more, demonstrating chemicals acting like a clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

When unstirred in a petri dish, the BZ reaction can produce spiral waves or expanding target patterns of color moving through the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. These are chemical waves, not water waves, propagating at a constant speed or growing and spinning as spirals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Remarkably, the same phenomenon is observed in the heart, where spiral waves of electrical excitation appear identical to chemical waves in the BZ reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This inspired Art Winfree, whose work on chemical reaction waves provided insight into cardiac arrhythmias, particularly deadly ventricular fibrillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Winfree's observation of rotating spirals in hearts and chemistry led to theories on the causes of ventricular fibrillation and the design of better defibrillators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## The Millennium Bridge: A Case of Excessive [[synchronization_in_chemical_and_biological_systems | Synchronization]]

While too little [[synchronization_in_chemical_and_biological_systems | synchronization]] (as in a fibrillating heart) causes problems, too much can also be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The wobbly Millennium Bridge was an example of this, attributed to "crowd synchrony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

The Millennium Bridge has a unique construction, with supporting cables running alongside it like taut guitar strings, giving it a ribbon-like appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Civil engineers know not to build a footbridge with a vertical resonant frequency equal to the human walking frequency of two strides (or two Hertz) per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The Millennium Bridge designers adhered to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

However, they were unaware of the importance of half that frequency – one cycle per second, which corresponds to the frequency of putting down one foot (e.g., the left foot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. When walking, people impart a tiny sideways force on the bridge with each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Normally, these sideways forces (about one-tenth of vertical forces) are negligible because people walk at their own pace, unsynchronized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. But if the bridge's sideways resonant frequency is one cycle per second, which the Millennium Bridge had, people can start to get it moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

After the bridge's closure, engineers conducted tests, having colleagues walk across it in increasing numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. With 50 or 100 people, there was little motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. At 156 people, there was still no wobble, but with just 10 more (166 people), the acceleration dramatically increased, and the bridge swayed like on opening day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. The system had undergone a phase transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

The key insight was that it wasn't people walking in sync that initially caused the bridge to wobble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Instead, if the bridge started to move sideways even slightly, people instinctively spread their legs to stabilize themselves, adopting a "penguin gait," and began to walk in step with the bridge's sideways motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. This created a positive feedback loop: the wobbling bridge caused people to walk in sync, which inadvertently pumped more energy into the bridge, worsening its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

Once the problem was identified, the solution was to decrease the coupling strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. Energy dissipating [[chevron_bracing_and_tuning_mass_dampers | dampers]] were installed along the bridge, costing several million pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Complex Systems

While reductionism (breaking problems into smaller parts) has been highly successful in science, the great frontier today is understanding how parts come together to form a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. This is the field of complex systems, which seeks to understand phenomena like the immune system, consciousness, or the economy, where the whole often appears to be more than the sum of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. Understanding the properties of the whole based on the properties of its parts remains a central research question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

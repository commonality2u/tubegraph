Soft robots, particularly those inspired by the growth of vines, represent a significant advancement in robotics due to their unique properties and versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These robots can grow to hundreds of times their original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> and are designed to be resilient against obstacles like adhesives or spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Despite their seemingly simple and inexpensive design, they have numerous [[potential_applications_for_jumping_robots | potential applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Design and Functionality

### Core Principle
The fundamental principle of these robots is growth from the tip, powered by compressed air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. They can be manufactured from almost any material, adhering to this basic mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The core concept originated from observing a vine growing in an office, extending towards sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Construction
The design is elegantly simple, involving airtight tubing folded in on itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. When inflated, the tube extends from its tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Steering
Steering can be achieved by externally taping the tubing to shorten one side, causing it to bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This method can create shapes like a helical deployable antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. More advanced steering uses pneumatic muscles, typically made from ripstop nylon fabric with a 45-degree braid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. By connecting three such muscles to independent air supplies, the robot can be steered as it extends by shortening or lengthening its sides, similar to how tendons control hand movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Retraction
Retracting the robot is more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. In confined spaces, pulling on the "tail" (the material passing through the core) can cause it to "ungrow" or retract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. In open areas, engineers have developed internal rollers to prevent buckling during retraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Force Generation and Variable Diameter
The robot's cross-section can be designed to change along its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. A wider section, akin to a "pillow" packed into the end, allows the robot to lift substantial weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Despite using low pressure (e.g., 1/10th of an atmosphere), a large surface area (like 600 square inches) can generate significant force (e.g., 600 pounds with 1 PSI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:04:22]</a>. This capability is crucial, as the material remains soft, preventing injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Sensor Attachment
Attaching sensors like cameras to the growing tip can be done using an end cap, where the camera is pushed from behind by the robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Another method involves mounting a wireless camera on an external frame that interlocks with an internal frame inside the pressurized body, similar to a roller coaster's wheels on a track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:56]</a>. This design prevents the camera from detaching as the robot grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Passive Intelligence
A notable characteristic of soft robots is their compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This "passive intelligence" allows them to navigate complex environments by naturally squishing and bending to find a path, even if the exact shape of the environment is unknown beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Key Characteristics

*   **Growth:** Can grow to hundreds of times its initial size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Resistant to adhesives and spikes; continues operation even if punctured, provided sufficient air pressure is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Maneuverability:** Can pass through tight spaces, navigate curvy passageways, and move over sticky surfaces effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effective:** The materials are inexpensive and lightweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, making them "basically free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Safety:** Remains soft even when lifting heavy objects, ensuring it doesn't harm individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Applications

### Search and Rescue
These robots are ideal for search and rescue operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:05:02]</a>. They can be grown into cluttered or collapsed buildings, continuing to search even when encountering significant obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:12]</a>. Their low cost allows for mass deployment; for instance, hundreds could be sent into a collapsed building, with the success of even one finding a survivor being invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:26]</a>. They can be designed to apply huge forces with soft, lightweight, and cheap materials, potentially lifting large objects off trapped individuals in situations like collapsed buildings or car crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Archaeology
[[vine_robots_in_space_exploration | Vine robots]] have been successfully used in archaeology. For example, a robot was deployed in Peru to explore very narrow shafts in an ancient temple in the Andes mountains, dating back to 1500-500 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:36]</a>. These ducts were too small for humans, but the robot provided video footage from inside the entire tunnels, offering crucial insights to archaeologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Medical Intubation
A miniature version of the [[vine_robots_in_space_exploration | vine robot]] is being developed to make medical intubation faster and safer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:09:15]</a>. Unlike traditional intubation, which requires highly trained professionals and can be time-consuming, this soft robot can be inserted by someone with no training by aiming it towards the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:30]</a>. The robot's compliance allows it to navigate the body passively, with the main body growing into the esophagus and a flexible side branch finding its way into the trachea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:12]</a>. Successful intubation has been demonstrated in cadaver labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Burrowing into Granular Materials
[[vine_robots_in_space_exploration | Vine robots]] can burrow into granular materials like sand or soil by fluidizing the material with a jet of compressed air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:11:30]</a>. This reduces the force of the sand, allowing the robot to extend through it by tip extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:36]</a>. This capability makes them a promising option for [[vine_robots_in_space_exploration | NASA]] for studying the surfaces of other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:55]</a>. Unlike previous burrowing robots that got stuck due to cohesive material and insufficient friction, the tip extension method does not rely on interaction with the surrounding material, allowing for continuous downward movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:50]</a>.

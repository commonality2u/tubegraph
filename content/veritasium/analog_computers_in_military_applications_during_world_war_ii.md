During World War II, [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]] played a critical role in various military operations, demonstrating their utility for complex calculations that digital machines of the era could not yet perform effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Tide Prediction for D-Day

Lord Kelvin's [[historical_use_of_analog_computers_for_tide_prediction | tide predicting machines]], originally developed in the 1860s, were overhauled to include 26 frequency components and were used extensively in planning the Allied invasion of D-Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

The Germans anticipated an invasion at high tide to minimize the Allied soldiers' exposure on the beaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Consequently, they installed millions of obstacles, many with explosive mines, that would be submerged by mid-tide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

Upon spotting these obstacles, the Allies changed their strategy, planning to begin the invasion at low tide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. This would allow demolition teams to clear channels through the obstacles before the main forces advanced as the water rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. It also ensured landing craft had enough time to depart without getting beached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Given that low tide times varied by over an hour across the five landing beaches, invasion times were precisely staggered based on these tide predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Anti-Aircraft Gun Directors

The U.S. military sought devices to automatically aim guns at dive bomber aircraft, which were difficult to shoot down due to their rapid, steep descents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### The M9 Gun Director

An innovative [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computer]] design by David Parkinson, initially conceived from a dream, won out among proposed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Parkinson, working at Bell Labs, adapted his automatic level recorder which used a potentiometer to control a pen's motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. He realized this device could be scaled up to control an anti-aircraft gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

Bell Labs researchers utilized their recently invented operational amplifier (op-amp), an [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog electrical device]] capable of performing mathematical operations with voltages like addition and multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. They employed these op-amps to create an [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computer]] to solve the ballistics equations for anti-aircraft guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Known as the M9 Gun Director, this computer rapidly calculated the correct trajectory and fuse setting using radar and optical sights to obtain enemy plane speed, altitude, and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Potentiometers were also used to determine the gun's pointing direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

> [!INFO] Impact of the M9 Gun Director
> In World War I, it took an average of 17,000 rounds to shoot down a single airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. By 1943, after the M9's invention, this average dropped to only 90 rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Norden Bombsight

The U.S. military made a substantial investment in the Norden bombsight, an "incredibly complex mechanical [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computer]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Designed by Carl Norden, it aimed to enable high-precision airborne bombing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. The device implemented 64 simultaneous algorithms, including one to compensate for the Earth's rotation as the bomb fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

The Norden bombsight was one of the war's most closely guarded secrets, with American bombardiers carrying handguns specifically to destroy it if their aircraft crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Limitations of the Norden Bombsight
> Despite significant hype and funding, the Norden bombsight did not perform as advertised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Its more than 2,000 fine parts required extreme manufacturing precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

> The fundamental problem with [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]] is that the physical device models the real world, so any inaccuracy in components directly translates to computational inaccuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. The inherent "slop" in connections between parts meant that repeating the same calculation would not yield the exact same answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

> In the American campaign against Japan, bomber crews using the Norden bombsight failed to destroy critical Japanese war infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This led the U.S. to abandon its precision bombing approach in favor of blanket napalm bombing of entire Japanese cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

## Transition to Digital Computing

As the war progressed, [[differences_between_analog_and_digital_computers | digital computers]] gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. The digital and electronic Colossus machines at Bletchley Park in the UK were vital for breaking German codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. In the United States, the military invested in ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), a complex and expensive [[differences_between_analog_and_digital_computers | digital machine]] designed to accelerate the calculation of land artillery firing tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. These tables were previously computed using differential analyzers, which were [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog mechanical computers]] based on Kelvin's harmonic analyzer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Although ENIAC was completed after the war, it demonstrated the power of [[differences_between_analog_and_digital_computers | digital computers]] and is considered by many to be the first modern computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

The fundamental shift towards digital was enabled by Claude Shannon's 1936 master's thesis, which showed that any numerical operation could be performed using the basic building blocks of Boolean algebra (true/false or one/zero values and AND, OR, NOT operations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This versatility, combined with their resilience to noise (as a large error is needed to mistake a one for a zero), cemented the dominance of [[differences_between_analog_and_digital_computers | digital computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. In contrast, each [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computer]] is typically designed for only one type of problem, and even small errors can grow and overwhelm the signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

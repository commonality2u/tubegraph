[[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]], our current best theory of gravity, describes how gravity is mediated through the curving of spacetime by mass and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Mathematically, this is described by [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein's field equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Nature of the Equations and Solvability
[[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein's field equations]] on one side describe the distribution of matter and energy, and on the other, the resultant curvature of spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Despite appearing as a single line, they are not one simple equation but rather a family of equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

The primary challenges in solving these equations include:
*   **Coupling**: The equations are coupled, meaning they depend upon each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Differential Nature**: They are differential equations, requiring complex integrals to be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

These complexities mean that many steps are needed to solve the field equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Solving them reveals how spacetime curves and how to measure the separation between events in that curved geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## Schwarzschild Solution: The First Breakthrough
Albert Einstein published his equations in 1915, but initially, he couldn't find an exact solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. Within weeks, Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. He simplified the scenario by imagining an eternal, static universe with only a single, spherically symmetric, electrically neutral, and non-rotating point mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. The Schwarzschild metric describes how spacetime curves outside such a mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

### Initial Problem Spots (Singularities)
Soon after its publication, two problematic spots were identified in Schwarzschild's solution:
1.  **Center of the Mass (r = 0)**: At the very center, a term in the equation is divided by zero, causing it to "blow up" to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. This is a *singularity*, where the equation breaks down and can no longer describe physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Schwarzschild Radius (Event Horizon)**: At a specific distance from the center, known as the Schwarzschild radius, another term blows up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. At this radius, the spacetime curvature is so steep that the escape velocity becomes the speed of light, meaning nothing, not even light, can escape from inside this boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. This led to the concept of a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

Initially, many scientists doubted the existence of black holes because they required an immense mass to collapse into a tiny space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Furthermore, Einstein himself was troubled by the implications that time freezes on the horizon, suggesting nothing could ever enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

### Resolving the Event Horizon Singularity
The apparent singularity at the event horizon was later understood to be a result of a "poor choice of coordinate system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>. By choosing a different coordinate system through a coordinate substitution, this singularity disappears, allowing objects to physically cross into the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.

This implies that while an outside observer would see an object slow down and freeze in time as it approaches the horizon, an observer crossing the horizon would not notice anything unusual and would pass through it directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.

## Kerr Solution: Spinning Black Holes
While Schwarzschild found his solution quickly, solving [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein's equations]] for a spinning mass proved much harder, taking over 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>. In 1963, Roy Kerr finally found the solution for a spinning black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>.

The Kerr solution introduced several dramatic changes:
*   **Complex Structure**: The black hole now consists of several layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Spherical Symmetry**: Due to rotation, it bulges around the equator, only symmetric about its axis of spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.
*   **Ergosphere**: A new region where space is dragged around with the black hole faster than the speed of light, making it impossible to stay still relative to distant stars, though escape is still possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>.
*   **Inner Event Horizon**: Inside this layer, movement becomes free again, and it's thought one can fly through the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03:00">[31:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>.
*   **Ring Singularity**: The point singularity at the center of a non-rotating black hole expands into a ring in a rotating black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>.

## Issues with Maximally Extended Solutions
While the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions offered profound insights, their "maximal extensions" (which suggest white holes, parallel universes, and even "anti-verses") present further challenges and unphysical aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>:
*   **Eternal Solutions**: Both extended solutions describe eternal black holes in an empty universe, meaning they have no formation mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>. This is a significant reason why black holes are believed to exist in our universe but white holes are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>.
*   **Infinite Energy Flux (Kerr Solution)**: For the maximally extended Kerr solution, an "immortal astronaut" inside the universe could send light into the black hole, which would pile up along the inner horizon, creating an infinite flux of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:26:00">[34:26:00]</a>. This concentration of energy would then create its own singularity, sealing off the ring singularity and the regions beyond it, effectively making other universes and wormholes inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>.

The mathematical possibility of traversable wormholes in [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein's general relativity]] was explored by Michael Morris and Kip Thorne in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>. However, these require an exotic kind of matter with negative energy density to prevent collapse, which is strongly believed to be against the laws of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>. If matter behaves as currently understood, such wormholes are not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>.

Therefore, according to current understanding, white holes, traversable wormholes, and parallel universes stemming from these solutions are unlikely to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>.

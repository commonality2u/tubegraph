The term "IQ" is widely recognized in popular culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, often understood as an objective and rigorous measurement of intellectual ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The concept of intelligence testing dates back hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, with a significant breakthrough in 1904 when English psychologist Charles Spearman proposed the "g-factor," or general intelligence, to explain correlations in student performance across different subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This g-factor was thought to capture how quickly students could learn new material, recognize patterns, and think critically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

At the same time, Alfred Binet in France developed the Binet-Simon test to identify students needing additional school support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This test assigned a "mental age" based on performance relative to age groups, which was then used to calculate an "intelligence quotient" (IQ) by dividing mental age by actual age and multiplying by 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The Binet-Simon test became the world's first IQ test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> and, after standardization in the U.S. by Lewis Terman, became the Stanford-Binet test, widely used for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Modern IQ tests aim to measure the g-factor by assessing various mental abilities, including memory, verbal, spatial, and numerical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. They minimize subject-specific distortions by including many distinct tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Scores are normalized, typically with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Factors Influencing IQ Scores

While IQ is meant to measure general intelligence, several factors beyond innate ability can influence an individual's score on an IQ test:

### Test Preparation and Strategy

*   **Training and Practice** Previous exposure and practice with IQ-style questions can improve scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Training and coaching can boost scores by up to eight points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
*   **Motivation and Incentives** The level of motivation to complete the test can significantly impact a score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. Studies show that offering monetary incentives can increase IQ scores by up to 20 points, with the largest effect observed in individuals with below-average IQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.
*   **Test-Taking Strategy** Individuals who are better at taking tests under time pressure, know when to skip questions, how to eliminate wrong answers, and when to guess, tend to perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Anxiety** A small amount of anxiety can be beneficial for performance, but excessive anxiety negatively impacts scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

### Biological and Environmental Factors

*   **Genetics** There is evidence for a [[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | genetic basis to IQ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Identical twins show a very strong correlation in IQ scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The heritability of IQ is estimated to be between 40% and 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Environment** Environmental factors contribute approximately 50% to IQ scores over a lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **Lifespan Consistency vs. Change** While IQ appears fairly consistent over one's lifetime, with scores 80 years apart correlating at 0.5 to 0.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, it is not completely fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Fluid intelligence (ability to learn and solve novel problems) peaks in early adulthood and then declines, whereas crystallized intelligence (accumulated knowledge) remains more stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
*   **Childhood Nutrition and Health** Improvements in childhood nutrition and health are believed to be one cause of the [[what_iq_tests_measure | Flynn Effect]], where average IQ scores have steadily increased over the last century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
*   **Education** Education can make individuals more intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. Better education helps individuals become better at problem-solving by providing more knowledge and facilitating associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
*   **Societal Work Shifts** A shift from manual labor to more abstract thinking in daily work over the last century may have also contributed to higher average IQ scores by making people better at the types of questions asked on IQ tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

### Cultural and Interpretive Nuances

*   **Cultural Bias** IQ tests do not objectively measure intelligence, as cultural changes and differences can affect average scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. It is impossible to construct a truly "culture fair" test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. Cultures differ in linguistic structures for shapes and spatial relations, influencing how people think about categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. Tests often fail to assess other forms of intelligence important for survival, such as ethnobotanical knowledge or rainforest survival skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.
*   **Historical Misuse** The [[history_and_origins_of_iq_tests | history and origins of IQ tests]] is marked by misuse, notably in the American eugenics movement, where claims of inherited and unchangeable intelligence led to forced sterilization laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. This dark past contributes to [[controversies_and_misconceptions_about_iq | controversies and misconceptions about IQ]] today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

## Conclusion

While IQ tests can predict aspects of life such as school success, job performance, and longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, they do not tell us how our lives will ultimately turn out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. The belief that IQ determines someone's worth is considered a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. Individuals have the capacity to dramatically improve their outcomes by building knowledge and analytical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

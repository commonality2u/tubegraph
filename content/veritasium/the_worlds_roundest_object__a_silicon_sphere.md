The world's roundest object is a 1-kilogram sphere made of silicon-28 atoms, estimated to contain approximately 2.15 x 10^25 of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Unprecedented Roundness

This sphere is recognized as the roundest object in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. To illustrate its extreme precision, if this silicon sphere were scaled up to the size of Earth, the difference between its highest "mountain" and lowest "valley" would be merely about 14 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Why is it Priceless?

The raw material used to create this silicon sphere was initially worth 1 million Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. However, after its precise sculpting, it is considered priceless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Only a handful of people, besides its creators, have ever held this sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The investment of a million Euros and thousands of man-hours into perfecting it stems from a critical need to redefine the base unit of mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## The Kilogram's Evolving Definition

The silicon sphere is central to efforts aimed at [[redefining_the_kilogram_using_silicon28_atoms | redefining the kilogram]].

### The 'Grave' and the French Revolution

The original name for the base unit of mass in the metric system was the 'grave' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. In 1793, a commission that included Antoine Lavoisier defined the grave as the weight of a cubic decimeter (one litre) of water at the melting temperature of ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:02:01]</a>. The name 'grave' came from the Latin 'gravitas', meaning weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. However, the name was short-lived because it sounded too similar to the aristocratic title 'graf' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. With the French Revolution promoting equality, a unit could not appear nobler than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Lavoisier himself lost his head, not due to his measurement work, but because he collected taxes as a nobleman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### From Gramme to Kilogram

The new republican government also believed the 'grave' was too large for their measurement needs, so they adopted the 'gramme', which was a thousandth of a grave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Soon after, they realized the gram was too small, leading them to return to the concept of the 'grave's' mass but, unable to use the original name, they invented the 'kilogram' â€“ a thousand grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This is why the kilogram is the only one of the seven base SI units to have a prefix in its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

In 1799, the definition of the kilogram was refined to be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which water is densest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Recognizing that water was not a sensible long-term standard, a pure platinum cylinder was created to match this mass and was named the "Kilogram of the Archives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. At this point, the kilogram's definition became tied to this physical object, not the mass of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### The International Prototype Kilogram (Big K)

In 1889, the kilogram was upgraded to a more durable platinum-iridium alloy cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This artifact, officially called the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) and affectionately known as "Le Grand K" or "Big K", has served as the definition of the kilogram ever since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It is the only thing in the universe with a mass of *exactly* one kilogram because it *is* the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It is also the only SI unit still defined by a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Big K resides in a climate-controlled vault, protected by three bell jars and three independently controlled keys, in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### The Instability of Big K

When Big K was created, 40 identical replicas were also made and sent to countries worldwide as national standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. However, when these kilograms were reunited for weigh-ins in 1948 and again 40 years later, their masses had diverged over time, even those stored together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Differences of up to 50 micrograms (the weight of a fingerprint) were observed, despite careful washing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This demonstrated that the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time, which is a significant problem for a fundamental unit of measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The instability of the kilogram affects four of the seven base SI units, as well as many derived units like Newtons, Joules, Volts, and Watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Notably, the avoirdupois pound is defined precisely as 0.45359237 kilograms, meaning its definition is also tied to Big K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## The Silicon Sphere's Role in Redefinition

The silicon sphere offers a path to eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Crafting Perfection

The sphere is started as an oversized object, about two millimeters larger in diameter, and then progressively ground finer using abrasives, essentially "massaging atoms" to control its shape at an atomic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. It is made of pure silicon, containing only one isotope, silicon-28, which contributes to its high cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A sphere was chosen because it is a simple object whose entire dimension can be characterized by knowing its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Counting Atoms

After its creation, the sphere's diameter is accurately measured using a laser by placing the sphere in the center of a cavity and measuring the gap between the laser and the sphere's sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Knowing the diameter allows for the determination of its volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Since the silicon material is a perfect crystal with no voids or dislocations, and the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, the total number of atoms within the sphere can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

This process aims to redefine Avogadro's constant. Currently, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram as the number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon-12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Using the silicon sphere, the number of silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then define the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This means the kilogram would be defined by a concept (a fixed number of atoms) rather than a physical object, ensuring its definition remains stable even if the silicon spheres were lost or damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Ideally, the official definition of the kilogram would become "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15 x 10^25 silicon-28 atoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## The Future of the Kilogram

There is a high likelihood that the kilogram's definition will be redefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The silicon sphere approach is complementary to another method involving fixing Planck's constant using a Watt Balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. If both approaches show good agreement and can reduce uncertainties to about 20 micrograms, the kilogram could be redefined as early as 2014, making it an unchanging unit no longer tied to a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Remarkable Accuracy
> The original intention for the kilogram was to be the mass of a litre of water at its densest temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. A litre of water at nearly four degrees Celsius has a mass of 999.975 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This means the historical artifact of the kilogram was accurate within the margin of error of a grain of rice, which is considered truly remarkable for scientists 214 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

The creation of the silicon sphere was an international collaboration of scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Interestingly, Antoine Lavoisier, who was involved in the initial definition of the kilogram's predecessor, also conceived of silicon as an element in 1787, showing his involvement in the kilogram's definition "from cradle to grave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

The intersection of [[role_of_mathematics_and_physics_in_financial_markets | mathematics and physics]] has profoundly influenced financial markets, leading to the creation of multi-trillion dollar industries and transforming approaches to risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Some of the most successful figures in the stock market have been physicists, scientists, and mathematicians rather than veteran traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Pioneers in Quantitative Finance

### Jim Simons and the Medallion Fund
In 1988, mathematics professor Jim Simons established the Medallion Investment Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For the next 30 years, the fund consistently delivered returns significantly higher than the market average, boasting 66% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. An investment of $100 in 1988 would have grown to $8.4 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This success made Jim Simons the wealthiest mathematician of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Isaac Newton's Financial Misstep
However, mathematical aptitude does not inherently guarantee success in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Isaac Newton, despite his genius, lost approximately a third of his wealth in the South Sea Company stock market crash of 1720 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. He famously remarked, "I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Louis Bachelier and the Random Walk

Jim Simons' success was built upon the groundwork laid by earlier pioneers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The first to apply [[role_of_mathematics_and_physics_in_financial_markets | mathematics to model financial markets]] was Louis Bachelier, born in 1870 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. After selling his father's wine business, he moved to Paris to study physics and found work at the Bourse, the Paris Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Understanding Options
Bachelier became interested in financial contracts known as options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The earliest known use of options dates back to around 600 BC by the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus, who purchased the option to rent olive presses based on his prediction of a bumper olive crop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

*   **Call Option**: Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a later date for a set price (the strike price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Useful if the price is expected to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Put Option**: Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a later date for the strike price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Useful if the price is expected to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Options offer several advantages:
1.  **Limited Downside**: Losses are limited to the premium paid for the option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
2.  **Leverage**: A small investment can yield significantly higher percentage returns compared to direct stock purchases if the price moves favorably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
3.  **Hedging**: Options can be used as insurance to reduce risk against potential losses in other investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The original motivation for options was to reduce risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### The Challenge of Pricing Options
Despite their long history, accurately pricing options remained a significant challenge, often relying on bargaining among traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Bachelier, interested in probability, believed a mathematical solution existed and proposed it as his PhD topic to Henri Poincar√© <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Stock Prices as a Random Walk
Bachelier realized that stock price movements, influenced by countless unpredictable factors (weather, politics, innovation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, could be modeled as a random walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This means a stock price is equally likely to go up or down at any given moment, like a coin flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This concept aligns with the [[Efficient Market Hypothesis]], which suggests that it's impossible to consistently make money by predicting stock movements because any predictable patterns would be immediately exploited and eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

#### The Galton Board Analogy
Bachelier used the analogy of a Galton board, where thousands of tiny ball bearings fall through pegs, each time having a 50/50 chance to go left or right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. While individual ball paths are unpredictable, the collection of all balls forms a predictable normal distribution, centered in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Similarly, Bachelier theorized that the expected future price of a stock follows a normal distribution, centered on the current price, and spreads out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

### Radiation of Probabilities and Diffusion
Bachelier's model for stock prices surprisingly mirrored the equation Joseph Fourier discovered in 1822, which describes how heat radiates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Bachelier termed his finding the "radiation of probabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

His work on the random walk also paralleled the later discovery of **Brownian motion** in physics:
*   In 1827, Robert Brown observed the random movement of pollen grains (and later non-organic particles) suspended in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The cause of this [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics_discoveries | random movement]] remained a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   In 1905, Albert Einstein provided the answer: Brownian motion is caused by trillions of unseen molecules colliding with the particle from all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Einstein's mathematical derivation, assuming the particle is equally likely to move in any direction, showed that the expected location of a particle follows a normal distribution that broadens over time, akin to Bachelier's stock price model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This proved the existence of atoms and molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

Bachelier completed his PhD by figuring out a mathematical way to price options, calculating the expected return of an option by multiplying the profit/loss by the probability of each outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. He argued that the "fair price" of an option is one that makes the expected return for both buyers and sellers equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Despite beating Einstein to the random walk and solving a centuries-old problem, his work went largely unnoticed by both the physics and finance communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## The Black-Scholes-Merton Equation

### Ed Thorpe and Dynamic Hedging
In the 1950s, physicist Ed Thorpe developed card counting to beat blackjack, then applied his skills to the stock market, pioneering a type of hedging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. He started a hedge fund that achieved a 20% annual return for 20 years, a record at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

Thorpe used **dynamic hedging**, a strategy where a seller of an option (e.g., Bob selling a call option to Alice) constantly adjusts their stock holdings to offset the risk from price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. This allows for synthetic creation of an option with minimal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Thorpe also improved Bachelier's model by accounting for stock price "drift" (a general upward or downward trend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### The Seminal Formula
In 1973, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, with Robert Merton independently publishing a similar version, developed the [[significance_of_the_blackscholesmerton_equation_in_finance | Black-Scholes-Merton equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Their approach assumed that if a risk-free portfolio of options and stocks (via delta hedging) could be constructed, its return in an efficient market should only be the risk-free rate (e.g., US treasury bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. They used an improved version of Bachelier's random walk model that included drift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

This equation provides an explicit formula for the price of an option based on input parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Its publication coincided with the founding of the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

#### Impact and Growth
The [[significance_of_the_blackscholesmerton_equation_in_finance | Black-Scholes-Merton formula]] was rapidly adopted as the benchmark for options trading on Wall Street, leading to the explosion of the exchange-traded options market into a multi-trillion dollar industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. Other multi-trillion dollar industries like credit default swaps, OTC derivatives, and securitized debt markets also utilize its principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

Derivatives, financial securities whose value is derived from another, are used by large companies, governments, and individual investors to hedge against specific risks, such as an airline hedging against rising oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. They also provide significant leverage, as seen in the GameStop phenomenon, where options allowed a small amount of cash to control a much larger value of underlying stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

The global derivatives market is estimated to be on the order of several hundred trillion dollars, vastly exceeding the size of the underlying securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. While derivatives generally enhance market liquidity and stability during normal times, they can exacerbate market crashes during periods of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

In 1997, Merton and Scholes were awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. Black was acknowledged posthumously, having passed away two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

## Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies

With the Black-Scholes formula publicly available, hedge funds needed new methods to find market inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. This is where Jim Simons, a mathematician whose work on [[Riemann geometry]] was foundational to [[Chern Simon's theory | knot theory]], quantum field theory, and quantum computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>, stepped in.

In 1978, Simons founded Renaissance Technologies, employing a strategy of using machine learning to find patterns in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. This approach was inspired by his earlier work for the US Institute for Defense Analysis, where he broke Russian codes by extracting patterns from vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. Simons hired top scientists, physicists, mathematicians, and statisticians, many with no prior finance experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

One key hire was Leonard Baum, a pioneer of [[Hidden Markov models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. These models, similar to Einstein's inference of atoms from Brownian motion, aim to identify unobservable factors that influence observable market phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

The Medallion Fund, utilizing these data-driven strategies, became the highest-returning investment fund ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. Its unprecedented success led some to question the [[Efficient Market Hypothesis]] itself, suggesting that predictabilities do exist in the stock market if one possesses the right models, training, resources, and computational power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

## Conclusion

Mathematicians and physicists have profoundly impacted investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. By modeling market dynamics, they have:
*   Provided new insights into risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.
*   Opened up entirely new markets, such as derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.
*   Determined accurate pricing for complex financial instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   Helped eliminate market inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

Ironically, the continuous effort to discover and exploit patterns in the market ultimately leads to their elimination, moving towards a perfectly efficient market where all price movements are truly random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

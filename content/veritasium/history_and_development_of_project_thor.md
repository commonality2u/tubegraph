Project Thor, also known colloquially as "Rods from God," is a conceptual space weapon designed to strike targets on Earth with extreme kinetic energy [03:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[03:42]</a>.

## Historical Development

The concept for Project Thor emerged in the late 1950s, a period when the United States felt threatened by the Soviet Union's advancements in space and missile technology [00:00:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. After the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, on October 4, 1957, and successfully tested the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) just over a month prior, the need for advanced defense capabilities became apparent [00:00:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

A researcher at Boeing, Jerry Pournelle, developed the idea for Project Thor [00:01:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. He named it after Thor, the Norse God who threw lightning bolts from the heavens [03:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15">[03:15]</a>.

### Key Objectives

Pournelle's concept aimed to:
*   Hit any location on Earth within 15 minutes, half the time an ICBM would take [00:01:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   Destroy targets buried up to 30 meters underground, such as Soviet nuclear silos [00:01:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Theoretically intercept ICBMs mid-flight [00:01:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Weapon Design and Functionality

Project Thor proposed using "telephone pole-sized pieces of tungsten" placed in orbit [01:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>. These rods would be released from space to strike a target at any given time within a 15-minute window [01:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>.

### Speed and Impact

*   Objects in orbit travel at approximately eight kilometers per second [02:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06">[02:06]</a>.
*   While atmospheric drag would slow the rod down during re-entry, it would still impact the target at about 10 times the speed of sound (Mach 10), or roughly three kilometers per second [02:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10">[02:10]</a>.
*   The kinetic energy of a single tungsten rod would be equivalent to the largest conventional explosive ever detonated, such as the MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast) which released 11 tons of TNT equivalent [02:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46">[02:46]</a>.
*   These weapons are not bombs and contain no explosives; their destructive power comes solely from their immense kinetic energy due to their weight and speed [02:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56">[02:56]</a>.

### Material and Shape

Tungsten is the preferred material for these rods due to two main reasons [03:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31">[03:31]</a>:
*   **Density**: Tungsten is exceptionally dense, weighing 19 tons per cubic meter, more than twice the density of steel. This allows for less volume for a given mass, reducing atmospheric resistance [01:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50">[01:50]</a>, [01:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53">[01:53]</a>.
*   **Melting Point**: Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, nearly 3,500 degrees Celsius. This property is crucial during re-entry, as it minimizes the need for extensive shielding to prevent the rod from melting due to heat buildup [01:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00">[01:00]</a>, [01:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03">[01:03]</a>.

The rod shape is chosen for its sleek, aerodynamic profile, which minimizes drag and helps the weapon maintain maximum speed upon impact, similar to arrows, bullets, and ballistic missiles [01:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23">[01:23]</a>, [01:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26">[01:26]</a>.

### Explosive Nature of Kinetic Impacts

Kinetic impacts at extreme velocities are explosive in nature [01:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58">[01:58]</a>. When objects collide at such speeds, their kinetic energy is converted into heat, turning the ground into liquid and gas that spray outwards in a giant, symmetrical explosion, similar to how craters on the moon are formed by asteroid impacts [01:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09">[01:09]</a>.

The resulting explosion is more localized than a conventional bomb, allowing for precise "surgical strikes" [01:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22">[01:22]</a>, [01:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25">[01:25]</a>. Unlike nuclear weapons, there is no radioactive fallout to worry about, and its use would not contravene existing international treaties that specifically prohibit nuclear weapons in space [01:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29">[01:29]</a>, [01:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36">[01:36]</a>.

## Related Projects and Concepts

*   **[[j_robert_oppenheimer_and_the_manhattan_project | Brilliant Pebbles]]**: In the 1980s, the Reagan administration seriously considered a kinetic missile interceptor idea under the codename [[j_robert_oppenheimer_and_the_manhattan_project | Brilliant Pebbles]], though the project was eventually abandoned [03:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21">[03:21]</a>, [03:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31">[03:31]</a>.
*   **Hypervelocity Rod Bundles**: The concept was resurrected in 2003 by the Air Force Transformation Plan, which referred to this weapon as "hypervelocity rod bundles" [03:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[03:33]</a>.

## Challenges to Implementation

Despite its theoretical advantages, Project Thor faces significant practical challenges [01:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>.

*   **Aiming**: Steering an object traveling at hypersonic speeds is incredibly difficult [01:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52">[01:52]</a>, [01:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55">[01:55]</a>. While thrusters, adjustable fins, or altering the rod's center of mass could theoretically aid steering, practical execution is complex [01:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55">[01:55]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Communicating with the rod from ground or space would be nearly impossible due to the superheated plasma surrounding it during re-entry [02:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06">[02:06]</a>, [02:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08">[02:08]</a>.
*   **Orbital Mechanics and Coverage**:
    *   Placing a rod in geostationary orbit (over 35,000 km away) would mean it would take several hours to fall to Earth, far exceeding the desired 15-minute strike window [02:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16">[02:16]</a>, [02:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29">[02:29]</a>.
    *   In low Earth orbit (around 350 km), a rod would complete a revolution around Earth every 90 minutes. This means a strike could take anywhere up to an hour and a half depending on the target's position relative to the rod's orbit [02:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37">[02:37]</a>, [02:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46">[02:46]</a>.
    *   To achieve a 30-minute strike window, hundreds of satellites would be needed to ensure a rod is always close to a target due to Earth's rotation and orbital drift [02:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>, [03:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a>.
*   **Cost and Maintenance**: Launching hundreds of rods into space would cost billions of dollars, with ongoing maintenance costs due to thruster breakdowns and malfunctions [03:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11">[03:11]</a>, [03:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16">[03:16]</a>.
*   **Missile Defense Limitations**: Even a smaller rod for missile defense is tricky [03:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26">[03:26]</a>, [03:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32">[03:32]</a>. Modern ICBMs split into multiple payloads and decoys after their boost phase, overwhelming anti-missile defenses [03:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40">[03:40]</a>. A global defense system would require a vast number of rods (e.g., 400 for North Korean ICBMs, or several times more for a global system), estimated to cost around $300 billion for even a limited system, almost half of the US military's annual budget [03:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51">[03:51]</a>, [04:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04">[04:04]</a>. Such a system could also be evaded by launching multiple missiles simultaneously [04:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>.

Due to these extensive challenges, Project Thor is currently considered unfeasible to execute in reality [04:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>.

## In Fiction

Jerry Pournelle, the originator of the concept, later became a science fiction writer [04:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32">[04:32]</a>. In his 1985 New York Times bestselling book, *Footfall*, an alien race utilizes kinetic weapons to invade Earth [04:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39">[04:39]</a>. Kinetic energy weapons, including "Rods from God," appear in dozens of movies, video games, and books [04:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49">[04:49]</a>, [04:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>.

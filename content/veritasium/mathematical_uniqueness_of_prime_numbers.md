While humans often perceive numbers like 37 as random, this perception is often flawed and reveals underlying patterns in human thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. When asked to pick a random number between 1 and 100, 37 is frequently chosen, analogous to the "blue-seven phenomenon" where people reliably select blue and 7 as a random color and number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. A large-scale survey involving 200,000 responses confirmed that 37, along with 7, 73, and 77, were among the numbers regarded as most random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that people's ideas of randomness are "decidedly not random" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Primes and Perceived Randomness

Prime numbers, including 37, often feel like the most random numbers to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This perception stems from several factors:
*   **Infrequent Appearance in Daily Life** Primes appear less frequently in everyday contexts compared to composite numbers, which often relate to multiple dimensions (e.g., pixel counts, fruit boxes, square footage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Lack of a Direct Formula** There is no simple formula to find the next prime number; one must check each subsequent integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The [[prime_number_theorem_and_its_implications | Prime Number Theorem]] provides an approximation (the nth prime number occurs around n times natural log of n), but it is not exact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Consequently, primes "essentially occur at random" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## 37: The Median Second Prime Factor

Beyond perceived randomness, 37 holds a unique mathematical property: it is the median second prime factor of all numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This means that for half of all numbers, their second smallest prime factor is 37 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

To understand this, consider:
*   **Smallest Prime Factors** For any number, 2 is the smallest prime factor for half of all numbers (evens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Similarly, 3 is the smallest prime factor for 1/6 of all numbers (those divisible by 3 but not 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Larger primes form the smallest prime factor for progressively fewer integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Second Smallest Prime Factors** The "second smallest prime factor" concept tracks the distribution of primes that appear after the absolute smallest.
    *   For example, 3 is the second prime factor of a number only if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., by 6), accounting for 1/6 of all numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   5 is the second prime factor for 1/10 of all numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This occurs if a number is divisible by 5 and 3 (but not 2), or by 5 and 2 (but not 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   As this calculation is extended across all integers, from 1 to [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]], 37 emerges as the median second prime factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Other Notable Qualities of 37

37 is categorized with several other mathematical distinctions as a prime number:
*   **Irregular prime** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>
*   **Cuban prime** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
*   **Lucky prime** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>
*   **Sexy prime** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
*   **Permutable prime** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>
*   **Padovan prime** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>

One individual's early childhood book introduced 37 simply as "a prime number. Nothing goes into it. Someday, you'll understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, highlighting its fundamental, irreducible nature. The 37th [[mersenne_primes_and_their_significance | Mersenne prime]] was also a significant discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>.

## Practical Importance: The Secretary Problem

The number 37 (specifically, 37%) also appears in the optimal strategy for certain decision-making scenarios, known as the secretary problem or marriage problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. This mathematical problem applies to situations where choices are immediate and final (e.g., renting an apartment, accepting a job offer) and not all options can be assessed simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The optimal strategy involves:
1.  **Exploring a percentage of options**: Automatically reject the first 37% of options to gather information and understand the range of choices available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
2.  **Selecting the next best**: After this initial exploration phase, choose the first option encountered that is better than all previously seen options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

Following this strategy, the chances of selecting the best option are approximately 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This rule can also be applied to time-based decisions; for example, spending the first 37% of a given timeframe (e.g., 3.7 years out of 10 for marriage) exploring options before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

The pervasive appearance and mathematical significance of 37 suggest a subconscious human recognition of its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

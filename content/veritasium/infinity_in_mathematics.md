[[Infinity and countability in mathematics | Infinity]] is a concept that can be explored through thought experiments like the Hilbert Hotel, which features an infinite number of rooms, numbered one, two, three, and so on forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Even with all rooms occupied by an infinite number of guests, the hotel manager can still accommodate more people, up to a certain limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Hilbert Hotel Paradoxes

### Accommodating New Guests

When a single new guest arrives, the manager of the Hilbert Hotel can accommodate them by asking every existing guest to move down one room (e.g., the person in room one moves to room two, room two to room three, and so on) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This frees up room one for the new guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The same logic applies to a finite number of new guests, such as a bus with a hundred people; everyone just moves down a hundred rooms to make space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Accommodating an Infinite Bus

If an infinitely long bus arrives carrying infinitely many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, a different strategy is required. Each existing guest is told to move to the room with double their current room number (e.g., room one to room two, room two to room four, room three to room six) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This frees up all the odd-numbered rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Since there are an [[Infinity and countability in mathematics | infinite number of odd numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, each person from the infinite bus can be assigned a unique odd-numbered room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Accommodating an Infinite Number of Infinite Buses

Even more guests can be accommodated if an infinite number of infinite buses arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The manager can use an "infinite spreadsheet" to organize everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This spreadsheet has a row for the existing hotel guests and a row for each bus (bus 1, bus 2, bus 3, and so on) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The columns represent the position of each person (e.g., hotel room one, hotel room two; bus one seat one, bus one seat two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Each person receives a unique identifier based on their vehicle and position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. By drawing a zigzag line that traverses every unique ID on this infinite by infinite grid exactly once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, it creates a single infinite line of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Each person on this line can then be assigned a unique room in the hotel, ensuring everyone fits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Countable vs. Uncountable Infinity

Despite the ability to accommodate vast infinities of guests, there is a limit to the Hilbert Hotel's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This limit is demonstrated when a "big bus" arrives, carrying an infinite number of people identified by infinitely long names consisting only of the letters A and B (e.g., ABB AAAA..., AB AB AB...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This bus contains a person for every possible infinite sequence of these two letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The hotel manager explains that these guests cannot all fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Even if an infinite list of rooms is created, matching each room to one of the infinite names, it's still possible to generate a name that is not on that list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This is done by taking the first letter of the first name on the list and flipping it (A to B, or B to A), then the second letter of the second name and flipping it, and continuing this process down the diagonal of the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The newly constructed name will differ from every name on the list by at least one character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

This demonstrates the difference between [[Countable vs uncountable infinity | countable and uncountable infinities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>:
*   The number of rooms in the Hilbert Hotel is [[Countable vs uncountable infinity | countably infinite]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, meaning there are as many rooms as there are positive integers (one to infinity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   The number of people on the "big bus" is [[Countable vs uncountable infinity | uncountably infinite]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. If one attempts to match each person with an integer, there will always be people left over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

This concept shows that [[Infinity and countability in mathematics | some infinities are bigger than others]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The discovery of different sized infinities spurred further inquiry that eventually led to the invention of modern computing devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

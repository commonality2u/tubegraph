Most people do not understand [[how_bicycles_work | how bicycles actually work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A common misconception is that to turn a bicycle, one simply turns the handlebars in the desired direction, similar to driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. However, turning a bicycle involves a technique known as countersteering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## The Principle of Countersteering

When riding a bicycle, steering the handlebars does not only affect the direction of travel but also significantly impacts [[balance_and_steering_mechanisms_of_bicycles | balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. If a rider wants to make a right turn and initially steers the handlebars to the right, they effectively steer the bike out from underneath themselves, causing a lean to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. To prevent falling, the rider must then steer the bike back to the left, which results in a left turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

Therefore, to initiate a right turn, a rider must first counter-steer to the left. This action causes the rider to lean to the right, into the desired turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This technique is often known intuitively by cyclists but not explicitly understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Riders will [[balance_and_steering_mechanisms_of_bicycles | counter-steer]] without conscious thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Experimental Demonstration

To demonstrate this, a modified bicycle was used, equipped with a radio controller that could lock the steering to one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. An LED indicated the only direction the steering could turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

Riders found it impossible to turn in a direction if the steering was locked to only allow turns in that same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. For example, attempting to make a right turn when the steering was locked to the right caused the rider to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This showed that successful turning requires the ability to counter-steer initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

Sometimes, by sheer luck, a rider might have already counter-steered before the steering locked, allowing them to complete a turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Even with steering locked in one direction, the bike could still be ridden perfectly well, but initiating a turn in the locked direction became impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### Steering for Balance
The primary takeaway from such experiments is that steering is not merely for turning the bike, but crucially, for [[balance_and_steering_mechanisms_of_bicycles | balancing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. This is why it's difficult to [[balance_and_steering_mechanisms_of_bicycles | balance]] on a stationary bike; steering is ineffective when the bike is not moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. A rider's [[balance_and_steering_mechanisms_of_bicycles | balance]] is maintained by constantly making small steering adjustments to keep the bike underneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This involves moving the contact patch of the front wheel under the rider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

## Analogies to Countersteering

The act of riding a bicycle is analogous to balancing an inverted pendulum, such as a broomstick on one's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. To move the broomstick forward while balancing it, one first pulls the base backward to initiate a forward lean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. Similarly, to move a pendulum in a certain direction, the base is first moved in the opposite direction, causing the pendulum to lean as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

This principle also applies to a unicycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. To go forward, a unicyclist must first pedal backward to achieve a forward lean, then they can move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. On a unicycle, longitudinal balance (front-to-back) is managed with the pedals, while lateral balance (side-to-side) is maintained by small counter-steers, similar to a bicycle, to position the contact patch under the rider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Beyond Rider Input: Bicycle Self-Stability

While riders actively use [[balance_and_steering_mechanisms_of_bicycles | countersteering]] for [[balance_and_steering_mechanisms_of_bicycles | balance]] and turning, bicycles also possess inherent self-stability mechanisms that allow them to remain upright without a rider at sufficient speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. These [[design_enhancements_for_bicycle_stability | mechanisms]] cause the handlebars to turn in the direction of a lean, effectively steering the wheels back underneath the bicycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>:

*   **Caster Effect**: Due to the angle of the front fork, the steering axis intersects the ground in front of the wheel's contact point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. If the bike leans, the force from the ground on the tire automatically turns the wheel into the lean, similar to a caster wheel on a shopping cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
*   **Mass Distribution**: The center of mass of the handlebars and front wheel assembly is slightly ahead of the steering axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. When the bike leans, their weight naturally pushes the front wheel in the direction of the lean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   **[[Gyroscopic effect and bicycle stability | Gyroscopic Effect]]**: Although not the primary reason for a bike's overall stability, the [[Gyroscopic effect and bicycle stability | gyroscopic effect]] of the spinning wheels contributes to steering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. When a force is applied to a gyroscope, it turns 90 degrees from the applied force, a phenomenon known as [[Gyroscopic precession | gyroscopic precession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. This aids in the corrective steering of the bike.

These inherent [[design_enhancements_for_bicycle_stability | design enhancements]] make bicycles self-stable without rider input. While related to [[balance_and_steering_mechanisms_of_bicycles | balance]] and steering, these automatic mechanisms are distinct from the active [[balance_and_steering_mechanisms_of_bicycles | countersteering]] performed by a rider. Understanding [[how_bicycles_work | how bicycles work]] is an ongoing area of research, leading to advancements like smart motors in handlebars that actively assist steering to maintain upright stability, even at low speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Most people ride bicycles without fully comprehending the underlying physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

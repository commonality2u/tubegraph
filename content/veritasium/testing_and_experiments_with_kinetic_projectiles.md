This article details a large-scale experiment involving the dropping of heavy metal weights from a helicopter onto targets, serving as a practical exploration of the theoretical [[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | kinetic energy weapons]] known as "Rods from God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The video captures the ambitious and terrifying nature of the undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Inspiration: Project Thor (Rods from God)

The concept for these experiments is rooted in "Project Thor," an idea for a space weapon developed in the late 1950s by Boeing researcher Jerry Pournelle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This concept emerged in response to the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik and their first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Project Thor envisioned putting telephone pole-sized pieces of tungsten into orbit, which could then be dropped on any target on Earth within 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These rods would re-enter the atmosphere at orbital speeds of about eight kilometers per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, slowing down due to [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | atmospheric drag]] but still impacting at approximately Mach 10 (three kilometers per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The theoretical destructive power of a single tungsten rod would be equivalent to the "Mother of All Bombs" (MOAB), one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosives, which released 11 tons of TNT equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This power comes purely from [[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | kinetic energy]], as the rods contain no explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Such weapons could theoretically destroy targets buried 30 meters underground, like missile silos, and intercept ICBMs mid-flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Later iterations of the concept included "Brilliant Pebbles" in the 1980s under the Reagan administration and "hypervelocity rod bundles" in the 2003 Air Force Transformation Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Colloquially, it became known as "Rods from God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Physics of Kinetic Energy and Impact

The [[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | kinetic energy]] of an object is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity (K.E. = 0.5 * mvÂ²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This means increasing velocity tenfold increases [[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | kinetic energy]] by a hundredfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Even light objects can carry immense [[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | kinetic energy]] at high speeds; for example, a 15-gram piece of plastic traveling at six kilometers per second can severely damage a block of aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This phenomenon is a significant risk for satellites and astronauts on the International Space Station, where micro meteorites or even flecks of paint can cause serious damage due to the massive orbital speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

When objects impact at extremely high speeds, their [[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | kinetic energy]] is released explosively, heating up the ground, turning material into liquid and gas, and spraying outwards symmetrically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This explains why craters on the Moon are circular, regardless of the asteroid's incoming angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The explosive nature of kinetic impacts allows for deep penetration (e.g., 30 meters of soil) and precise "surgical strikes" without radioactive fallout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Notably, current international agreements only prohibit nuclear weapons in space, not kinetic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Real-world Experimentation

The experiment aimed to test the destructive potential of a "Rod from God" on a smaller scale, specifically by dropping heavy metal weights from a helicopter onto a sandcastle city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Professional sandcastle builders were hired to construct an elaborate city for the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Initial Targeting Tests

The primary concern was the difficulty of aiming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Initial attempts involved dropping a 100-kilogram (220-pound) mass from 500 meters (1,500 feet) onto a swimming pool, using GPS for targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

*   **First Drop:** The first drop from 500 meters missed the pool significantly, landing "way past the sandcastle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Despite both ground and helicopter GPS indicating correct positioning, the weight was blown off target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The mass still hit the ground at about 350 kilometers per hour, carrying nearly half a million joules of [[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | kinetic energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

*   **Second Drop (Cube):** To address targeting issues, a "cube drop" was attempted from a much lower altitude of 100 meters (300 feet), relying on visual targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This was done with a cube-shaped weight instead of a rod because cylinders, surprisingly, tend to fall on their sides rather than straight down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This drop also missed the target pool by 60 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

*   **Third Drop (Pool Hit):** A 200-kilogram (440-pound) mass was dropped from an even lower altitude of 50 meters (150 feet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This attempt successfully hit the edge of the pool, ripping through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### Sandcastle City Drops

With a successful pool hit, the team proceeded to target the sandcastle city from 100 meters (300 feet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The weights used were made of steel, which is cheaper than tungsten, but tungsten is preferred for actual "Rods from God" due to its extreme density (over twice that of steel) and highest melting point of any metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. The density allows for smaller volume and less [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | air resistance]], while the high melting point helps prevent melting during re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Aerodynamic rod shapes are also crucial for minimizing drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

*   **First Sandcastle Drop:** This drop from 100 meters just missed the city, landing directly in front of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Second Sandcastle Drop:** This attempt also missed the main city structures, hitting something on the left but not the primary target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **Third Sandcastle Drop (Direct Hit):** Finally, a direct hit occurred on a building in the sandcastle city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Surprisingly, the impact only partially destroyed the building, creating cracks but not demolishing the entire structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. This illustrated that even with a direct hit, the impact was more localized than initially anticipated for the scaled-down experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
*   **Final Attempt (500m):** A final, last-ditch attempt was made to drop from 500 meters again, but the safety concerns became paramount, and the footage was not even recorded due to the terror of hitting something or someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The weight bounced out on impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

## Feasibility of "Rods from God"

The experiments highlighted the significant challenges of deploying real "Rods from God":

*   **Aiming Difficulty:** It is incredibly difficult to aim an object traveling at hypersonic speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. While theoretical methods like thrusters, adjustable fins, or changing the center of mass exist, practical application is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   **Communication Issues:** Communicating with the rod from the ground or space would be nearly impossible due to the superheated plasma surrounding it during re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Orbital Mechanics and Response Time:**
    *   Placing rods in geostationary orbit (over 35,000 kilometers) would mean they take several hours to fall to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
    *   In low earth orbit (around 350 kilometers), a rod revolves around Earth every 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. To ensure a 15-minute strike window, hundreds of satellites would be needed to account for Earth's rotation and orbital drift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Cost and Maintenance:** Launching a hundred rods into space would cost billions of dollars, with ongoing maintenance costs due to thruster breakdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Missile Defense Limitations:** Even for missile defense, hitting ICBMs during their brief boost phase is extremely tricky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Modern ICBMs split into multiple payloads and decoys, overwhelming anti-ICBM defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. A limited system for North Korean ICBMs alone would require around 400 rods across eight orbits, costing roughly $300 billion, nearly half the US military's annual budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Even then, an enemy could evade the defense by launching multiple missiles simultaneously, as only one rod would be available at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

Ultimately, the experiments and analysis concluded that "Rods from God" are unfeasible to execute in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. Jerry Pournelle, the originator of the idea, later became a [[the_role_of_kinetic_weapons_in_science_fiction | science fiction]] writer, incorporating [[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | kinetic weapons]] into his 1985 book *Footfall* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. The conclusion is that this weapon concept remains largely within the realm of [[the_role_of_kinetic_weapons_in_science_fiction | science fiction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

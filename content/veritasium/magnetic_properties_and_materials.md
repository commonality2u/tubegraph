This article explores the nature of magnetism, the properties of different materials in magnetic fields, and the applications of strong magnetic fields, particularly focusing on the world's strongest continuous magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

## The World's Strongest Continuous Magnet

The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida, has held the Guinness World Record for the strongest continuous magnetic field since the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This electromagnet creates a magnetic field of 45 Tesla, which is nearly a million times Earth's magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

For reference:
*   Earth's magnetic field is 0.00005 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   A fridge magnet is around 0.01 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   MRI machines can get up to three Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The magnet apparatus is two stories tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, but the maximum field only occurs in the center of a narrow cylinder that runs through the middle, with the maximum field being only about a centimeter tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This small area is sufficient for users working with very small samples, such as computer chips or cell phone components, for [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | material science]] or kinetic matter research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### The Fringe Field and Safety

The magnetic field extends above and around the magnet, known as the fringe field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Though much weaker than 45 Tesla, it remains dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The size of the fringe field depends on the bore size of the superconducting magnet; a larger bore results in a larger fringe field because magnetic flux must form a complete loop outside the windings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

At the 100 Gauss line (0.01 Tesla), objects with shapes will start orienting themselves to the field, and if moved closer, they can be violently accelerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Due to this, no ferromagnetic objects or metallic implants (like pacemakers) are allowed within the 100 Gauss line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Operating the magnet to full power takes about an hour and a half, requiring 47,000 amps of current into the outer superconducting electromagnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Historical Context of Magnetism

Magnetite, an iron-containing mineral, is the mineral that led to the discovery of magnetism over 3000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Naturally magnetized pieces were found in Magnesia, Greece, giving rise to the word "magnet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. These "stones from magnesia" were also called lodestones and could attract each other or iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. By the 11th century in China, it was discovered that magnets could be used to create compass needles, with one side pointing north (the "north seeking pole") and the other south (the "south seeking pole") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Types of Magnetic Materials

The magnetic properties of materials stem from their electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Electrons behave as tiny magnets, but in most atoms, they are paired up with opposite orientations, causing their magnetic fields to cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Atoms with half-filled outer electron shells have magnetic fields because their electrons cannot fully pair up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Ferromagnetic Materials

For a bulk material to be magnetic, not only must its atoms have magnetic fields, but these atomic fields must be aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Within a material, regions of aligned atoms are called domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. For the material to be magnetic, all domains must be aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This alignment can be achieved by applying a strong external magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Materials meeting these criteria are called ferromagnetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Iron is the most common, but nickel and cobalt are also ferromagnetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

*   **Behavior in Strong Fields:** Ferromagnetic objects are strongly attracted to magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. A Nerf football with steel washers, when thrown near the magnet, was noticeably pulled towards it, while an unmodified ball was not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Ferrofluid:** Ferrofluid contains nanoscale magnetite particles suspended in a solution, coated with surfactants to prevent clumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. In an external magnetic field, these particles align like iron filings around a bar magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Near the world's strongest magnet, ferrofluid formed parallel ridges and then spikes, eventually climbing the sides of its vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Paramagnetic Materials

Some materials are always attracted to magnetic fields and display paramagnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Oxygen is a paramagnetic material; liquid oxygen drips off the bottom of a magnet as it is attracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The presence of an external field causes the material's internal magnetic field to strengthen the overall external field, leading to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

### Diamagnetic Materials

Most materials are repelled by a strong enough magnetic field, regardless of the pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This phenomenon is known as diamagnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Water is a good example; in an external field, water molecules become opposing magnets and are repelled, causing an indent on the water's surface when a magnet is brought near <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

This repulsion can be used to levitate objects that are not typically considered magnetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Strawberries, raspberries, and plastic pizza can be levitated due to their water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Living organisms, containing enough water, can also be levitated, as demonstrated with frogs, grasshoppers, and mice in experiments to understand weightlessness without space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

While strong magnetic fields have no lasting long-term effects on living things, they can polarize stones in the inner ear, causing rodents to spin for a few minutes after exiting the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

## Phenomena Related to Strong Magnetic Fields

### Induced Electric Currents (Eddy Currents)

When a conductor moves through a magnetic field, or the magnetic flux through it changes, it induces electric currents called eddy currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. These currents create their own magnetic field that opposes the change in the original flux, a principle known as Lenz's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

*   **Falling Plates:** If a metal plate falls towards a north magnetic pole, the induced currents create a north magnetic pole, repelling the plate and causing it to fall much slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The eddy currents dissipate energy as heat, causing the plate to warm up as it falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. An electromagnetic levitator at the Palace of Discovery in Paris uses alternating current to levitate a plate, generating so much heat that water boils on its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Opposing Motion:** Lenz's Law acts as a "No You Don't" law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. If one tries to lift a metal plate from the magnet, a south magnetic pole is induced, attracting it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Pushing a plate down quickly increases the rate of flux change, inducing stronger opposing currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Objects in Motion:** A thick aluminum cylinder dropped on the magnet or rolled across it refuses to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Similarly, a volleyball wrapped in aluminum foil passed over the magnet also experiences significant deceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Projectile Deceleration:** When aluminum projectiles from a potato cannon were fired across the magnet's fringe field, they decelerated and rotated to align with the magnetic field lines, minimizing flux change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Projectiles containing wire coils connected to LEDs lit up, demonstrating the induced currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Superconductors and Levitation

In superconductors below their critical temperature, electrical resistance is zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. When a magnet is brought close, currents are induced to oppose the flux change, and these currents persist indefinitely, expelling the magnetic field (Meissner effect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Engineered defects in some superconductors create non-superconducting filaments that trap magnetic field lines, preventing movement (flux pinning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

*   **Human Levitator:** A human levitator consists of a 90-pound magnet hovering above a ring of superconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. When a person stands on the magnet, pressing it towards the superconductors, the increased magnetic flux induces currents that repel the magnet, causing levitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

## [[Construction and design of high field magnets | Construction and Design of High Field Magnets]]

The world's strongest magnet cannot be made solely with superconducting magnets because they have a limit to the magnetic field they can withstand before losing superconductivity, nominally around 20 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

The solution is a hybrid magnet design:
*   An outer superconducting electromagnet produces 11.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   An inner resistive electromagnet, made of ordinary wire, produces 33.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
*   By Maxwell's equations, the fields add up to 45 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

Making high-field resistive magnets is challenging due to heat dissipation from innermost windings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Francis Bitter realized that conductors could be flattened into thin plates and stacked with alternating insulators to form a helix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This "Bitter plate" design allows cooling water to be pushed axially through the stack, removing heat and enabling much higher currents (up to 57,000 amps) than traditional wire-wound electromagnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. These stacks are aligned, compressed with 20 tons of force, and then locked to ensure electrical connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. Thousands of gallons per minute of deionized water are circulated to prevent melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

Material failure can occur when the metal goes past its plastic limit, deforms, shorts, and vaporizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, leading to expensive failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. China recently commissioned a similar 45 Tesla hybrid magnet, making two such magnets in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

## [[Applications and phenomena related to strong magnetic fields | Applications and Importance of Strong Magnetic Fields]]

Running the world's strongest magnets requires a significant amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. The Mag Lab consumes about 8% of Tallahassee's total generating capacity, with an electricity budget of $250,000 to $300,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. They have an arrangement with the city to use federally mandated reserve power, allowing the city to monetize otherwise unsellable power, while the lab can quickly ramp down if the power is needed elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

Strong magnetic fields are crucial for [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | material discovery]] by creating extreme environments alongside high electric fields, high pressure, and ultra-low temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. They also enable the improvement of existing materials by aiding in the removal of impurities, which reduces electron scattering and enhances material properties, revealing phenomena previously unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

Strong magnets are core to future technologies, such as electric vehicles, which rely on electric motors that require magnets to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The field of strong magnetic fields is still in its early stages, with much potential for future discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

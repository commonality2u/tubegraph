On August 21, 2017, a total solar eclipse occurred, with an observation point located in Madras, Oregon, under clear skies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Preparation and Equipment
To aid in [[photography_techniques_for_eclipses | eclipse photography]], a sky tracker was used. This device is designed to move the camera with the sky, compensating for the Earth's rotation to keep the sun within the camera's shot during the [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | eclipse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Solar filters were also utilized on the front of the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Progression of the Eclipse
### First Contact (C1)
The [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | eclipse]] began with "first contact," or C1, where the moon was observed entering from the top right side of the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Approaching Totality and Initial Effects
Seventeen minutes prior to [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | totality]], noticeable [[effects_during_a_solar_eclipse | changes in light]] began, with the surroundings becoming visibly dimmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. A cold wind was also felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, and the temperature dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

As the sun reached approximately 90 percent coverage, [[effects_during_a_solar_eclipse | shadows became much sharper]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Normally, shadows appear fuzzy because sunlight emanates from multiple locations, but during the [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | eclipse]], light was coming from a single, small sliver of the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### The Experience of Totality
The experience of [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | totality]] was described as "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, "unbelievable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, and "totally creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. During this phase:
*   A breeze was present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   The sky took on an appearance resembling [[effects_during_a_solar_eclipse | sunset or sunrise in every direction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   [[community_reactions_to_solar_eclipses | People reacted enthusiastically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   The appearance of the sky was unsettlingly "wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   [[effects_during_a_solar_eclipse | Solar prominences]] and the [[effects_during_a_solar_eclipse | solar Corona]] were visible at the top left, right, and bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   The planet [[effects_during_a_solar_eclipse | Venus]] was directly visible overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   The observer was left speechless by the "unreal" and "totally nuts" event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   Someone in the background described it as "a hole in the sky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Diamond Ring Effect and Post-Totality
The re-emergence of the sun, marked by the diamond ring effect, was met with [[community_reactions_to_solar_eclipses | loud cheering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Following [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | totality]], the solar filter was placed back on the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Acknowledgements
The observer expressed gratitude to Patreon supporters, whose contributions made possible the flight to Oregon, the purchase of equipment for camera tracking and solar filters, and overall enabled the experience of witnessing this [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | total solar eclipse]] and creating related videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Standardized tests, such as the SAT, have historically played a significant role in determining educational opportunities and future paths for students in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a> However, instances of errors within these exams have highlighted their fallibility and potential repercussions.

## The Infamous 1982 SAT Question

In 1982, a specific SAT math problem, known as Question 17, stumped every single student who took the test, as well as the test writers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. The question presented a scenario where circle A, with a radius one-third that of circle B, rolls around circle B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Students were asked to determine how many revolutions circle A would make to return to its starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

The intuitive answer, based on the ratio of circumferences (circle B's circumference being three times circle A's), was three revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This was the answer chosen by both students and the test writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. However, this answer was incorrect, and the actual correct answer was not provided among the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Identifying the Error

Only three students out of 300,000 test-takers—Shivan Kartha, Bruce Taub, and Doug Jungreis—identified the error and wrote to the College Board, the administrator of the SAT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. They confidently asserted that the College Board was wrong and provided proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

The core of their argument lies in the [[common_errors_in_geometry_questions | coin rotation paradox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. If two identical coins are used, the rolling coin actually rotates twice as it circles the other, not once as intuitively expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This occurs because the circular path itself accounts for an additional rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Applying this principle, the correct answer for Question 17 was found to be four revolutions, derived by taking the ratio of circumferences (3) and adding one additional rotation for the circular path (3+1=4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

### Ambiguity and Multiple Interpretations

The question's wording also introduced ambiguity, allowing for other interpretations:
*   **From the perspective of the center**: If one considers the rotation from the perspective of Circle B looking out at Circle A, or Circle A looking at itself relative to Circle B, the answer would be three revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. This is akin to turning the circular path into a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   **Astronomical definition of "revolution"**: In astronomy, a revolution is defined as a complete orbit around another body, separate from rotation about its own axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. By this definition, Circle A would only "revolve" around Circle B once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

The ability to justify at least three different solutions highlighted the question's extreme ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Official Response and Consequences

After reviewing the students' letters, the College Board publicly acknowledged their mistake and nullified Question 17 for all test-takers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. This decision, however, came with consequences:

*   **Score Adjustments**: Students' scores were rescaled without the question, resulting in their final results moving up or down by up to 10 points out of 800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. While seemingly small, 10 points can significantly impact a person's educational opportunities, especially for universities and scholarships with strict minimum score cutoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Cost**: The rescoring process cost the testing service over $100,000, which was ultimately paid for by test-takers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Modern Context

The principle behind the solution to Question 17, where the distance traveled by the center of a rolling circle equals the amount it has rotated (if rolling without slipping), has broader applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. This concept is crucial in astronomy for accurate timekeeping, explaining the difference between a solar day (24 hours) and a sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. This difference leads to a [[Impacts of education and culture on IQ | Sidereal year]] having approximately one more day than a solar year when viewed by an external observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

[[Challenges in standardized testing | Errors on standardized tests]] were not unique to the 1982 SAT. However, in the years since, the role of these exams has evolved.

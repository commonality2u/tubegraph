Jumping is a common form of locomotion, used by various animals and now achieved by engineered robots. While both biological and engineered systems share fundamental principles of jumping, advancements in robotics have allowed engineered jumpers to surpass their biological counterparts in performance through innovative design principles.

## Defining a Jump
For something to be classified as a jump, it must meet two specific [[criteria_and_mechanisms_of_jumping | criteria]]:
1.  Motion must be created by pushing off the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This means a quad-copter, which pushes off the air, does not count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  No mass can be lost during the jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Therefore, rockets ejecting burnt fuel or arrows launched from a bow are not considered jumps, unless the bow accompanies the arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Biological Jumpers
Many animals, from sand fleas and grasshoppers to kangaroos, propel themselves into the air with a single stroke of their muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The height of their jump is determined by the energy delivered in this single stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. To jump higher, the muscle's strength must be maximized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The Galago, also known as the Bush baby, is considered the best jumper in the animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This is because 30% of their entire muscle mass is dedicated to jumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, allowing the squirrel-sized primate to leap over two meters from a standstill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Their advantage comes from having more muscle mass dedicated to jumping, not inherently better muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Some biological organisms utilize latches to store and release energy, such as the sand flea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This involves a large power muscle and a smaller trigger muscle to achieve a torque reversal mechanism, leading to a sudden release of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. While biological organisms use latches, no organism has internally developed "work multiplication" for a jump from a standstill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, external work multiplication has been observed, such as spider monkeys pulling back a branch hand over hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> or slingshot spiders pulling back a silky string multiple times to launch themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Engineered Jumpers
Early jumping toys, like poppers, store energy in their deformed shape, acting as a spring that releases a large force in a single stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. All elastic jumpers follow this principle of storing and releasing energy from a spring in a single stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

A record-breaking tiny robot, weighing less than a tennis ball (30 grams), can jump 31 meters high, surpassing the previous record of 3.7 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This [[design_and_mechanics_of_the_highest_jumping_robot | design and mechanics of the highest jumping robot]] makes it faster than human perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Design and Mechanism
The robot's main structure consists of four pieces of carbon fiber bound by elastic bands, forming a spring that stores all the jump energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. A small motor at the top winds a string connected to the robot's bottom, compressing the structure and storing energy in the carbon fiber and rubber bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. After about 1.5 minutes, maximum compression is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. A trigger then releases a latch holding the string, unspooling it all at once and releasing the stored energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This propels the jumper from standstill to over 100 kilometers per hour in only nine milliseconds, resulting in an acceleration of over 300 g's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The robot's exceptional height is due to three special design features:
1.  **Incredibly Lightweight**: At 30 grams, it uses a tiny motor and battery, and its structure of carbon fiber and rubber doubles as the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Natural latex rubber can store 7,000 joules per kilogram, more energy per unit mass than almost any other elastic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
2.  **Efficient Spring Design**: The spring is a hybrid of rubber bands and carbon fiber slats. This design achieves an almost flat force profile over its entire compression range, providing double the energy storage of a typical spring where force is proportional to displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Researchers consider this the most efficient spring ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This highlights the advantages of [[compliant_mechanisms_and_their_advantages | compliant mechanisms]] and their application in [[compliant_mechanisms_in_micro_and_macro_engineering | micro and macro engineering]].
3.  **Work Multiplication**: Unlike animals that use a single muscle stroke, engineered jumpers can store energy from many motor revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The small motor builds up energy gradually over several minutes, rather than delivering it all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This "time for energy" trade-off is possible due to a latch under tension that prevents the spring from unspooling until full compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

A [[counterintuitive_engineering_concepts | counterintuitive engineering concept]] discovered was that adding "dead weight" (e.g., a chunk of steel) to the top of the jumper can actually make it jump higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This is because the body (the moving part) should weigh at least as much as the foot to ensure efficient energy transfer during the collision with the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Applications and Future Developments
Engineered jumpers hold promise for [[applications_of_jumping_robots_in_space_exploration | space exploration]], particularly in environments with thin or non-existent atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. On the moon, with one-sixth of Earth's gravity, this robot could leap 125 meters high and half a kilometer forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Jumpers could overcome obstacles like steep cliffs and deep craters that rovers struggle with, fetching samples and returning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. If kinetic energy could be stored back in the spring upon landing, the efficiency could be near perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

A fleet of jumping robots is being developed, with some capable of righting themselves after landing for immediate re-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Others are steerable, using three adjustable legs to launch in any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Comparison and Evolution of Jumping
For years, engineered jumping aimed to mimic biological jumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, with the introduction of work multiplication, engineered jumpers gained a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. By allowing a motor to run for a longer time to build up energy, the motor's power is no longer the limiting factor; the spring becomes the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

This specific jumper has nearly maximized the achievable height with its current spring design, with theoretical improvements of only around 19% even with an infinitely light motor and infinite winding time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Scaling the jumper up 10 times isometrically could lead to a 15-20% higher jump by reducing the effect of air drag, as the mass increases proportionally more than the cross-sectional area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

The concept of work multiplication could revolutionize robotics, allowing robots to store and release vast amounts of energy, overcoming the current limitation of small, portable motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

The [[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | planned obsolescence]] of products has led consumers to fight back through the "Right to Repair" movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Legislation and Goals
Currently, proposed legislation for the "Right to Repair" exists in the European Union and over 25 states in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. These laws aim to compel manufacturers to facilitate product repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This includes requiring manufacturers to provide information and access to parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The objective is to allow consumers to replace components like batteries or repair cracked screens at third-party shops without invalidating their warranty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Limitations
Even if "Right to Repair" legislation becomes law, it may not eliminate all forms of obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Manufacturers can still render products obsolete by influencing consumer desire for new styles and designs, a tactic known as [[dynamic_obsolescence_in_the_automotive_industry | dynamic obsolescence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This highlights that while reparability is addressed, the continuous cycle of stylistic updates, common in industries like fashion and tech, remains a driving force for new purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The existence of odd perfect numbers is considered one of the oldest unsolved problems in mathematics, dating back 2000 years, and was listed among four pressing open problems in 2000 by Italian mathematician Piergiorgio Odifreddi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Despite attempts by many bright mathematicians, the problem remains unsolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Solving it could be as simple as finding a single number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, but computers have checked numbers up to 10<sup>2,200</sup> without success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## What is a Perfect Number?

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
For example:
*   **6** has proper divisors 1, 2, and 3. Adding them gives 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **10** has proper divisors 1, 2, and 5. Adding them gives 1 + 2 + 5 = 8, so 10 is not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

Most numbers either overshoot or undershoot this sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Within the first 100 numbers, only 6 and 28 are perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The next two are 496 and 8,128, found within the first 10,000 numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. All currently known perfect numbers are even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Historical Perspective on Odd Perfect Numbers

Around 300 BC, Euclid discovered a pattern for generating even perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. His formula is 2<sup>P-1</sup>(2<sup>P</sup> - 1), where (2<sup>P</sup> - 1) is a prime number (now known as a Mersenne Prime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Since this formula always includes a factor of an even number (2<sup>P-1</sup>), it will always produce an even perfect number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. However, Euclid did not prove that this was the *only* way to generate perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. This left open the possibility of other forms, including odd perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

Centuries later, in the 2nd century AD, the Greek philosopher Nicomachus published *Introductio Arithmetica*, in which he made five conjectures about perfect numbers, including the statement that "all perfect numbers are even" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. For over a thousand years, these conjectures were considered facts as no one could prove or disprove them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

## Euler's Breakthroughs

The problem of odd perfect numbers saw significant progress with Leonhard Euler in the 18th century, who became passionate about number theory after Christian Goldbach introduced him to Fermat's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

Euler made three major breakthroughs related to perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
1.  **Discovery of the Eighth Perfect Number**: In 1732, he discovered the eighth perfect number by verifying that 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 is prime, as Marin Mersenne had predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.
2.  **Euclid-Euler Theorem**: Euler invented the sigma function (σ), which sums all divisors of a number, including the number itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. For a perfect number *n*, σ(*n*) = 2*n* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. Using this function, Euler proved that *every* even perfect number has Euclid's form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. This is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem and proved Nicomachus's fourth conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.
3.  **Form of Odd Perfect Numbers**: Euler also sought to solve the problem of odd perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. He proved a statement, similar to one conjectured by René Descartes, that if an odd perfect number *n* exists, it must have a specific form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.
    *   An odd perfect number *n* is odd, and σ(*n*) = 2*n* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.
    *   If a prime number is raised to an odd power, its sigma function result is even (e.g., σ(7<sup>1</sup>) = 1+7 = 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.
    *   If a prime number is raised to an even power, its sigma function result is odd (e.g., σ(7<sup>2</sup>) = 1+7+49 = 57) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.
    *   Since σ(*n*) = 2*n*, and 2*n* has only one factor of 2 (as *n* is odd), only one of the prime factors in *n*'s prime factorization can be raised to an odd power. All other prime factors must be raised to an even power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.
    *   Euler further refined this to show that an odd perfect number must be the product of a prime raised to an odd power, and the square of a different number, or more precisely, it must satisfy a specific condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>.

Despite these breakthroughs, Euler himself couldn't prove whether odd perfect numbers existed, calling it "a most difficult question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

## Modern Search and Conjectures

For 150 years after Euler, little progress was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. Computer science has revolutionized the search for new Mersenne primes (and thus even perfect numbers) through projects like GIMPS (Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>, but the search for odd perfect numbers remains elusive.

### Computational Bounds

Researchers have tried to find odd perfect numbers by checking various odd numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:34:00">[22:34:00]</a>. Using algorithms like a factor chain, it has been shown that if an odd perfect number exists, it must be larger than 10<sup>300</sup> (in 1991) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. This lower bound was raised to 10<sup>1,500</sup> by Pascal Ochem and Michael Rao 21 years later, with recent progress pushing it to 10<sup>2,200</sup> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>. With numbers that large, it's unlikely a computer will find one soon, necessitating a more theoretical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.

### Web of Conditions

A primary approach to proving or disproving the existence of odd perfect numbers involves deriving more and more conditions that such a number must satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:00">[23:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>. This "web of conditions" includes requirements like having a minimum number of prime factors (e.g., 10 prime factors, thousands of non-distinct prime factors) and being larger than 10<sup>3,000</sup> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>. The hope is that eventually, these conditions will become so numerous and restrictive that they demonstrate odd perfect numbers cannot exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>. However, this method has not yet yielded a proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>.

### Spoofs

Numbers that are very close to being odd perfect numbers are called "spoofs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. An example is Descartes' number: 198,585,576,189. It can be factored as 3<sup>2</sup> × 7<sup>2</sup> × 11<sup>2</sup> × 13<sup>2</sup> × 22021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>. If 22021 were prime, this number would be perfect according to Euler's sigma function, but 22021 is composite (19<sup>2</sup> × 61), meaning Descartes' number is a spoof, not a perfect number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>.

Odd perfect numbers would share all properties of spoofs, plus additional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>. The goal is to find properties of spoofs that prevent them from being odd perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>. For instance, if spoofs must be divisible by 105, and odd perfect numbers cannot be, this would disprove their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:56:00">[24:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>. In 2022, Pace Nielsen and a team at BYU found 21 spoof numbers, including Descartes' example, but did not find properties that rule out odd perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:12:00">[25:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:00">[25:18:00]</a>.

### Heuristic Arguments

Many mathematicians, including Carl Pomerance, believe that odd perfect numbers do not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>. This belief stems from heuristic arguments, which are not formal proofs but probabilistic arguments based on how frequently primes appear (referencing [[the_prime_number_phenomenon | the prime number phenomenon]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>. Pomerance's heuristic predicts that there are no more than 10<sup>-540</sup> perfect numbers of the form N = pm<sup>2</sup> between 10<sup>2,200</sup> and infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:14:00">[26:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>. The heuristic suggests that odd perfect numbers "shouldn't expect any" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:00">[26:25:00]</a>.

However, the same heuristic also predicts that there are no large even perfect numbers, which contradicts the expectation that infinitely many even perfect numbers exist (as suggested by the Lenstra and Pomerance Wagstaff conjecture for Mersenne primes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:00">[26:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:03:00">[27:03:00]</a>. This highlights that while heuristics offer strong indications, they are not proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>.

## Significance of the Problem

While the problem of odd perfect numbers may not have direct real-world applications, its study contributes to the broader field of number theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>. Historically, number theory was considered "useless mathematics" for over 2000 years, but it later formed the foundation for modern cryptography, which secures everything from text messages to government secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:00">[28:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. Similarly, non-Euclidean geometries, initially developed as intellectual curiosities, underpin Einstein's general relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[28:50:00]</a>.

The pursuit of such problems drives the development of new mathematical ideas and knowledge, even if their ultimate utility isn't immediately apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a>. Approximately 10 to 15 people are currently working on perfect numbers, and even high schoolers are encouraged to engage with this problem, as contributions can still be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>. The only way to discover the potential impact of such abstract mathematical pursuits is to engage in the process of solving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:00">[29:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.

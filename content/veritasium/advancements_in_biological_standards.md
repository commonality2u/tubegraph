The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a U.S. government warehouse, stores and sells a wide array of [[Standard Reference Materials and their Uses | Standard Reference Materials]] (SRMs), including various biological samples and living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These materials are meticulously characterized to provide "truth in a bottle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, ensuring the accuracy of measurements across diverse fields, including biological and health-related applications.

## Diverse Biological Samples

NIST maintains a collection of various biological tissues and substances for scientific and regulatory purposes. These include:
*   **Marine Animals, Birds, and Human Tissue** Samples of mussel, dolphin, whale, bird tissue, and even human tissue are stored in vats of liquid nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Domestic Sludge** This material is the dried solid waste from wastewater treatment plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It serves as a tool for environmental monitoring, allowing researchers to examine traces of toxins or heavy metals that individuals may be exposed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Human Fecal Matter** A "human poop product" is planned for release to support health research, particularly related to the microbiome and gut flora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This material, distributed as a vial of powder, is intended to support measurements of metabolites, despite fecal matter being an incredibly difficult matrix to measure and extract components from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

## Living Standard Reference Material

As scientific knowledge advances, NIST is adapting its offerings to include living biological systems. The first living [[Standard Reference Materials and their Uses | SRM]] is set to launch, consisting of hamster ovary cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. These cells are capable of producing monoclonal antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Monoclonal antibodies are a significant component of the pharmaceutical industry, accounting for five of the top ten best-selling drugs and over $75 billion in annual global sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## Rapid Response Standards

NIST also demonstrates the capability to rapidly develop biological standards in response to public health crises. For example, when monkeypox began to spread, a lack of clear laboratory tests hindered diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. NIST successfully created a positive control reference of monkeypox DNA in just 30 days, providing a crucial tool for accurate diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

The development and distribution of these biological [[Standard Reference Materials and their Uses | SRMs]] by NIST ensure that measurements are accurate and consistent, which is fundamental for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and the burgeoning biotechnology industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

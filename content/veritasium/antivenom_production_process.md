Antivenom is a life-saving medical product used to neutralize the effects of venom from snake and spider bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. In Australia, a federally funded antivenom program ensures that antivenom is provided for free to anyone who needs it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Venom Collection

The first step in antivenom production is collecting venom from highly venomous snakes and spiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The Australian Reptile Park, for instance, houses numerous dangerous species for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Danger in Handling Snakes
The room where venom is collected is considered "the most dangerous room in the country," housing venomous snakes from floor to ceiling, secured by small locks and thin glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. A scratch from some species, like the Coastal Taipan, can be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Staff, like Zac, who has been working with snakes for over 10 years, remain highly vigilant because of the [[danger_and_safety_measures_in_handling_snakes | inherent danger]] of handling these animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Zac himself experienced a serious incident from a scratch by a snake, leading to 36 hours in ICU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### The "Milking" Process
During "milking," a snake's head is pinned, and its fangs are directed onto a "shot glass" or vial, allowing the snake to bite and expel venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Snakes are not "stupid" and prefer to bite flesh rather than glass, making the process risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. After the initial bite, venom glands are massaged to extract additional drops, as "every drop matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The return of the snake to its enclosure is considered the "sketchy bit" as it becomes a race against time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Venomous Snakes and Their Venom Yield
The Australian Reptile Park selectively breeds snakes, such as Coastal Taipans, to produce significantly more venom than their wild counterpartsâ€”up to five, six, or even seven times more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. These "super snakes" can yield 4.5 to 4.9 grams of venom per bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. One Inland Taipan bite contains enough venom to kill half a million mice or over 100 humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Approximately 15 snakes are required to produce one vial of antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Nature of Snake Venom
Snake venom evolved from saliva and is primarily used for catching and digesting prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Each snake species possesses venom tailored to its specific prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Venom glands are located behind the snake's eye, with the shortest duct path leading to the back end of the top jaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Over time, [[evolutionary_aspects_of_snake_venom | evolutionary pressures]] caused fangs to move forward and develop grooves, eventually forming hollow tubes to inject venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Only about 1/7 of the world's snakes have hollow fangs, though almost all venomous snakes in Australia do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Snake venom is lethal to humans because we are closely related to rodents, a common prey for snakes, sharing similar biology in cells, blood clotting, and nerve signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Venoms typically target conserved molecular pathways found across vertebrates or even the entire tree of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

Venom can kill through four main mechanisms, often in combination, as venoms can contain up to 200 compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>:
*   **Neurotoxic**: Damages the nervous system and brain by interfering with neurotransmitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Hemotoxic**: Thins blood, prevents wound healing, and causes internal bleeding by disturbing blood coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Cytotoxic**: Attacks cells, leading to severe blisters, necrosis, and cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Myotoxic**: Destroys muscles and causes paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Historical and Modern Antivenom Production

### Early Observations
The [[scientific_development_of_antivenom | scientific development of antivenom]] has roots in observations of traditional practices. In 1870, British military doctor Edward Nicholson observed snake handlers in Burma deliberately exposing themselves to Cobra bites, potentially to develop an immune response, noting that older handlers were less affected by accidental bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### Albert Calmette's Breakthrough
Twenty years later in Saigon, French medical researcher Albert Calmette, inspired by the threat of Cobras, explored creating a vaccine for snake bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
His method involved:
1.  **Immunization**: Injecting rabbits with tiny, gradually increasing doses of Cobra venom over eight months. The rabbits developed antibodies and could tolerate 15 times the normal lethal dose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
2.  **Antibody Transfer**: Drawing blood from a venom-resistant rabbit, isolating the antibody-rich serum, and injecting it into a rabbit never exposed to venom. This rabbit then survived twice the lethal dose of Cobra venom, demonstrating the transfer of immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
This marked the creation of the first antivenom (or "antivenin") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Current Antivenom Production
Today, antivenoms are produced in a similar way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
1.  **Venom Preparation**: Collected venom is frozen, then sent for dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
2.  **Donor Animal Immunization**: The diluted venom is injected into a donor animal, typically a horse, chosen for its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Over months, increasing doses allow the horse to build immunity to the venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
3.  **Antibody Isolation**: The horse's blood is drawn, and only the plasma, containing the crucial antibodies, is isolated, while red blood cells are returned to the horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. These horse antibodies are the life-saving antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

Antivenom works because horse antibodies are similar to human antibodies due to shared [[evolutionary_aspects_of_snake_venom | evolutionary history]] with other mammals, allowing them to bind to and neutralize toxic compounds in the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its effectiveness, the current method has downsides:
*   [[danger_and_safety_measures_in_handling_snakes | Collecting venom]] is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   It involves many donor animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   Some people are allergic to antivenom, which can cause severe anaphylactic reactions requiring adrenaline to counteract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

Scientists are exploring new methods, such as producing antivenom using genetically modified bacteria to create specific antibodies for each venom toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. However, for now, the traditional method remains vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

The demanding work of individuals involved in venom collection saves countless lives worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

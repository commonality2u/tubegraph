From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

For many years, and even today, there has been a significant [[misconceptions_about_electricity_in_circuits | misconception about electricity and how it flows]] and how electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to a device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This misunderstanding particularly relates to how power plants deliver electricity to homes, especially with [[alternating_current_ac_dynamics_and_energy_flow | alternating current (AC)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Common (Incorrect) Model

A widely taught, but incorrect, model for electrical transmission likens power lines to a flexible plastic tubing with electrons inside acting like a chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. In this analogy, a power station pushes and pulls electrons back and forth, for example, 60 times a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. When a device like a toaster is plugged in, electrons are allowed to run through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The resistance in the toaster element causes electrons to dissipate energy as heat, thus toasting bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Why the Common Model is Flawed

This "great story" is, in fact, wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **No Continuous Conducting Wire**: There isn't a continuous conducting wire running directly from a power station to a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. There are physical gaps and breaks, such as in transformers, where electrons cannot flow from one coil to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Energy Flow Direction**: If electrons carried energy from the power station to a device, then when those same electrons flow back to the power station (as in AC), they should also carry energy back from the house to the power station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, energy only flows in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Electron Movement**: Electrons themselves possess very little potential energy and barely move within the wires; their drift velocity is extremely slow, around a tenth of a millimeter per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They are not "pumped" or "pushed" through a continuous loop, nor do they primarily dissipate their energy in the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## The Correct Understanding: Fields and Energy Flux

The correct understanding of energy transmission in electrical circuits involves electromagnetic fields and energy flux, concepts that represent a huge breakthrough in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Maxwell's Equations and Light

In the 1860s and 1870s, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell established that light is composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. These fields oscillate perpendicular to each other and are in phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Maxwell's equations govern the behavior of these fields and waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This concept laid the groundwork for understanding the [[role_of_electric_and_magnetic_fields_in_energy_transfer | role of electric and magnetic fields in energy transfer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Poynting Vector and Energy Flux

In 1883, John Henry Poynting, one of Maxwell's former students, considered the conservation of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. He reasoned that if energy is conserved locally, its path of flow should be traceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Just as sunlight's energy is stored and transmitted in the electric and magnetic fields of light during its journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, Poynting worked out an equation to describe energy flux—the amount of electromagnetic energy passing through an area per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

This is known as the [[poynting_vector_and_energy_flux_in_electrical_circuits | Poynting vector]] (symbol S), and its formula is given by `S = (1/μ₀) * (E x B)`, where `μ₀` is the permeability of free space, `E` is the electric field, and `B` is the magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The cross product `E x B` means multiplying their perpendicular magnitudes, with the direction found by the right-hand rule (fingers point in E, curl towards B, thumb points in the direction of energy flux) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

This equation shows that energy flows perpendicular to both the electric and magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Importantly, Poynting's equation applies whenever electric and magnetic fields coincide, not just for light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Energy Flow in a Circuit

In a simple circuit with a battery and a light bulb:
*   **Fields Develop**: When the circuit is closed, the battery's electric field extends through the circuit at the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This field causes electrons to accumulate or deplete on conductor surfaces, creating surface charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. These surface charges generate a small electric field inside the wires, causing electrons to drift (current) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The current, in turn, creates a magnetic field outside the wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Energy Flow**: With both electric and magnetic fields present in the space around the circuit, energy flows according to Poynting's theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Using the right-hand rule, energy is found to flow radially outwards from the battery into the fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Along the wires, energy flows to the right, towards the bulb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. At the light bulb's filament, the Poynting vector is directed inwards, indicating that the bulb receives energy from the surrounding field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Energy takes many paths from the battery to the bulb, but in all cases, it is transmitted by the electric and magnetic fields **outside** the wires, not by the electrons within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This is why [[the_misconception_about_electricity_and_how_it_flows | people often think they are "pumping electrons" or "buying electrons," which is incorrect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Application to Alternating Current (AC)

For an alternating current (AC) source, the direction of current reverses every half cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. However, both the electric and magnetic fields also flip at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Consequently, the Poynting vector still points in the same direction—from the source to the bulb—at any instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The analysis for direct current (DC) therefore still applies to AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This correctly explains how energy flows from power plants to homes via [[implications_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_power_lines | power lines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>: electrons oscillate back and forth within the wires without carrying the energy, while oscillating electromagnetic fields outside the wires transmit the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Historical Validation: Undersea Telegraph Cables

This understanding is not merely academic; it was learned through hard experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The laying of undersea telegraph cables, such as the first Transatlantic cable in 1858, presented practical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

*   **Cable Failure**: The 1858 Transatlantic cable worked for only about a month and never properly, experiencing enormous signal distortions where pulses became lengthened, making it difficult to differentiate dots from dashes in Morse code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Scientific Debate**: Scientists debated the failure. William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) incorrectly believed electrical signals moved through cables like water through a rubber tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. However, others like Oliver Heaviside and George Francis Fitzgerald correctly argued that the fields *around* the wires carried the energy and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Proof of Field Theory**: This view proved correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The problem with the submarine cable was its construction: the central copper conductor was coated in an insulator and then encased in an iron sheath. The iron, though intended for strength, acted as a good conductor, interfering with the propagation of electromagnetic fields by increasing the line's capacitance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

This historical lesson explains why most power lines today are suspended high up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Even damp earth acts as a conductor, so a large insulating gap of air is needed to separate the wires from the ground to prevent interference with the crucial electromagnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## The Light Bulb Thought Experiment

Consider a circuit with a battery, a switch, a light bulb, and two wires each 300,000 kilometers long (the distance light travels in one second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The light bulb is only one meter away from the switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Based on the understanding that energy is transmitted by fields around the wires:
*   After closing the switch, the light bulb will turn on almost instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   The limiting factor is how fast the electric and magnetic fields propagate through the space around the wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Since the bulb is only one meter away, these fields can reach it in a few nanoseconds, causing the bulb to light up in roughly `1/c` seconds (where `c` is the speed of light) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

The common misconception is that the electric field needs to travel all the way down the light-second-long wire, causing the bulb to take a second to light up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. However, it's what happens *around* the wires that truly matters for energy transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

This phenomenon, that traveling electromagnetic waves around power lines deliver power, is a fundamental aspect of how electricity works that remains widely unknown despite its everyday use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

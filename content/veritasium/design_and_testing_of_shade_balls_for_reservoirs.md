Shade balls are small, black plastic spheres deployed in large numbers on the surface of water reservoirs. While often mistaken for a primary solution to reduce evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, their main [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | purpose]] in the Los Angeles Reservoir is to prevent the formation of a carcinogenic compound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The LA Reservoir alone contains 96 million shade balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Bromate Problem: The Real Purpose

The deployment of shade balls at the LA Reservoir was necessitated by a specific water quality issue involving Bromide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Bromide is a naturally occurring substance, often associated with saltwater intrusion in sources like the California Aqueduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. While harmless in its natural state and difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, Bromide transforms into Bromate when disinfected with Ozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Bromate is carcinogenic, and regulations concerning its formation were established around the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Initially, Bromate levels at the filter plant were within the 10 micrograms per liter limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. However, a beverage company customer in LA reported high Bromate levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Investigations revealed that Bromate levels jumped immediately upon water entering the open reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. It was discovered that Bromide, when combined with Chlorine (used for disinfection) and exposed to bright sunlight, formed Bromate even more readily than with Ozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Since removing Bromide or Chlorine was not feasible, the only option was to eliminate sunlight from the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Design and Development

Before shade balls, various solutions were considered:
*   **Floating tarps**: This was deemed a multi-year project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Trampoline-like covers with PVC pipe**: These were rejected due to concerns about becoming bird perches and causing water quality problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Floating high-density polyethylene pipe**: While HDPE floats, it was considered too difficult and expensive to float a pile of pipes across the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Chipped pipe debris field**: This was dismissed as it would create warm, mushy water with plastic, resembling a Petri dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Dr. Bryan White's research led to the discovery of existing "bird balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. These had been used to deter waterfowl from mine tailings ponds (to prevent poisoning) and from airport ponds (to prevent collisions with jet engines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. While originally designed to deter birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, they proved effective at covering water surfaces.

### Material and Color
Shade balls are made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE), the same food-grade plastic used for milk jugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. They are black to block all light from reaching the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This black color is achieved using "carbon black" pigment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, which is crucial for the plastic's stability and durability when exposed to sunlight for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Other colors, like various shades of blue, were tested but their dyes were unstable and would not last more than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The balls are inert and harmless, safe for contact with drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### Weight and Stability
Shade balls are partially filled with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This internal water weighting prevents them from being blown away by high winds, which could otherwise send them bouncing onto freeways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The water makes them wobble if they do start to roll, further keeping them in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This added weight makes them significantly more difficult to push out of the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, especially when they form close-packed structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Moving a boat through them is described as very hard, like driving through peanut butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Shape
While other shapes like hexagonal pieces ("hexes" or "ravioli") exist, the spherical shape of the shade ball is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Spherical balls are designed not to stack up or get stuck on the reservoir banks as water levels fluctuate, allowing them to spread out and cover the water surface effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Testing and Benefits

### Initial Bromate Testing
To determine if shade balls could solve the Bromate problem, a simple experiment was conducted: three kiddie pools were filled with reservoir water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. One was exposed to sunlight, one was covered with a tarp, and one was covered with shade balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The shade balls immediately solved the Bromate formation issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Wind Tunnel Testing
Even before their use in reservoirs, the original "bird balls" underwent wind tunnel testing at speeds of 50-60 mph to observe their behavior in high winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Additional Benefits
Beyond preventing Bromate formation, shade balls provide significant additional benefits:

*   **Algae Control**: By blocking sunlight, shade balls eliminate algae growth in the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, which previously caused discoloration and required significant chlorine application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The use of chlorine has drastically reduced since the shade balls were deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Evaporation Reduction**: Despite being black, shade balls reduce evaporation by 80 to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This is due to several factors, forming part of [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | the science behind shade balls in water]]:
    *   They reduce the exposed surface area of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   They limit air flow over the water's surface, preventing the removal of moist air and its replacement with dryer air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
    *   While the top of the black balls gets hot, the bottom remains cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The air contained within the balls acts as a good thermal insulator, similar to a double-paned window, preventing significant heat transfer to the water below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Measurements show that the water under shade balls is actually cooler than in an uncovered reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Bird Deterrence**: Since the deployment of the balls, birds no longer land on the reservoir surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This prevents potential water quality issues from bird droppings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## [[cost_and_benefits_of_using_shade_balls | Cost and Economic Impact]]

Shade balls cost around 33-34 cents per piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. They also have a salvage value as they are made from recyclable material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Over their lifespan, the savings from reduced chlorination and evaporation are estimated to pay for at least half the cost of the balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The water quality benefits, however, are considered immeasurable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

A single, simple rule underpins all of [[Physics and aerodynamic principles | physics]], from classical mechanics to electromagnetism, quantum theory, and general relativity, down to the fundamental particles [00:00:00] [00:00:03] [00:00:06] [00:00:10] [00:00:13] [00:00:16] [00:00:19]. This rule may even explain the behavior of life itself [00:00:30] [00:00:33]. The understanding of this rule began with a simple problem [00:00:51].

## The Brachistochrone Problem

The problem of fastest descent, also known as the brachistochrone problem, asks: what shape of ramp will get a mass from point A to point B the fastest? [00:00:55] [00:00:58] [00:01:03]. Common sense might suggest the shortest path, a straight line from A to B [00:01:06] [00:01:08] [00:01:10]. However, bending the ramp down slightly at the start allows the mass to accelerate to a higher speed earlier, enabling it to travel faster and beat a straight ramp, despite covering a slightly longer distance [00:01:12] [00:01:14] [00:01:15] [00:01:18] [00:01:20]. The challenge was to find the perfect balance between acceleration and path length to minimize travel time [00:01:24] [00:01:27] [00:01:30].

Galileo believed the fastest path was the arc of a circle, demonstrating it was faster than any polygon [00:01:32] [00:01:36] [00:01:39]. However, this was not the absolute fastest [00:01:39].

### A Challenge for Mathematicians

Nearly 60 years later, in June 1696, Johann Bernoulli issued this problem as a challenge to the world's best mathematicians [00:01:43] [00:01:47] [00:01:49]. He sought to prove his superiority [00:01:52] [00:01:54]. Bernoulli initially gave six months for solutions, but none were submitted [00:01:57] [00:01:59] [00:02:01]. His friend, Gottfried Leibniz, persuaded him to extend the deadline to allow foreigners a chance [00:02:04] [00:02:06] [00:02:08]. The intended target was likely Isaac Newton, who was widely considered the best mathematician [00:02:12] [00:02:14] [00:02:16].

### Newton's Swift Solution

By January 29, 1697, Newton, then working as the warden of the Mint [00:02:21] [00:02:25] [00:02:28], received Bernoulli's challenge [00:02:30] [00:02:33] [00:02:36]. Despite his irritation at being "dunned and teased by foreigners about mathematical things" [00:02:39] [00:02:40] [00:02:44], Newton found the problem too enticing [00:02:47]. He spent the rest of the day and night solving it, delivering a solution by 4:00 AM [00:02:49] [00:02:53]. This feat took Bernoulli two weeks [00:02:57].

Newton submitted his unsigned solution to the journal *Philosophical Transactions* [00:03:02] [00:03:03] [00:03:07] [00:03:09]. Upon seeing it, Johann Bernoulli famously said, "I recognize the lion by his claw," acknowledging Newton's unmistakable genius [00:03:09] [00:03:13] [00:03:15] [00:03:19] [00:03:22] [00:03:23]. While Newton generally outshone Bernoulli, Bernoulli's solution for this specific problem was considered more elegant and beautiful [00:03:27] [00:03:30] [00:03:31] [00:03:36] [00:03:38] [00:03:39] [00:03:42] [00:03:46].

## Inspiration from Light

To solve the brachistochrone problem, Bernoulli drew inspiration from an ancient philosophical problem concerning how light travels [00:03:46] [00:03:48] [00:03:52].

### Fermat's Principle of Least Time

Hero of Alexandria, in the 1st century AD, contemplated light's path [00:03:56] [00:03:59]. He realized that in a single medium, such as air, light always follows the shortest path [00:04:01] [00:04:04] [00:04:07]. This explains why the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when light reflects [00:04:07] [00:04:10] [00:04:12]. Any other path would be longer [00:04:15] [00:04:17].

However, when light moves from one medium to another, like from air to water, it refracts and bends in a peculiar way, not following the shortest path [00:04:18] [00:04:21] [00:04:23] [00:04:25] [00:04:29]. Over 1,600 years, people gradually discovered Snell's Law, stating that the sine of the angle of incidence divided by the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant (n) dependent on the two media [00:04:47] [00:04:50] [00:04:52] [00:04:55] [00:04:58] [00:05:01] [00:05:04]. Yet, the underlying reason for Snell's Law remained unknown until 1657 [00:05:04] [00:05:06] [00:05:09].

Pierre Fermat, a judge by day and mathematician by night, became interested in light's refraction [00:05:09] [00:05:11] [00:05:12] [00:05:14] [00:05:16] [00:05:17] [00:05:20] [00:05:21] [00:05:24] [00:05:25] [00:05:29]. He hypothesized that Hero of Alexandria was on the right track, but what was being minimized was time, not distance [00:05:34] [00:05:36] [00:05:38] [00:05:40] [00:05:42]. Fermat realized that if he could calculate the time for every possible path light could take by varying the intersection point at the boundary, and then show that light takes the path with the shortest total travel time, he could explain refraction [00:05:42] [00:05:45] [00:05:46] [00:05:47] [00:05:50] [00:05:53] [00:05:55] [00:05:57]. Although initially hesitant due to the perceived complexity [00:06:00] [00:06:02] [00:06:04], Fermat eventually solved it five years later [00:06:09] [00:06:12] [00:06:15] [00:06:17] [00:06:18]. He demonstrated that Snell's Law emerges directly from the principle of minimizing time when light moves between media with different speeds [00:06:19] [00:06:22] [00:06:25] [00:06:28]. The constant 'n' in Snell's Law is simply the ratio of the speed of light in the first medium to the speed of light in the second medium [00:06:30] [00:06:32] [00:06:34] [00:06:35] [00:06:37].

Fermat described this calculation as "the most extraordinary, the most unforeseen, and the happiest calculation" of his life [00:06:42] [00:06:43] [00:06:45] [00:06:48] [00:06:49] [00:06:53]. His principle of least time explained all known phenomena of light at the time and was the first instance of nature obeying an optimization principle â€“ that nature does the best possible thing [00:06:57] [00:06:59] [00:07:02] [00:07:04] [00:07:06] [00:07:09] [00:07:10].

## Bernoulli's Brilliant Analogy

Bernoulli was aware of Fermat's principle of least time and believed he could apply it to solve the problem of fastest descent [00:07:18] [00:07:19] [00:07:21] [00:07:24]. He converted the mechanics problem of a sliding particle into an optics problem [00:07:26] [00:07:28] [00:07:31].

Instead of a mass accelerated by gravity, Bernoulli imagined a ray of light that would accelerate as it passed into layers of progressively less dense media [00:07:35] [00:07:37] [00:07:41]. By making these layers infinitesimally thin, where Snell's Law applies at each interface, a continuous curve emerges [00:07:45] [00:07:47] [00:07:50].

The challenge was to determine how the speed of light should change between layers to accurately model a falling object [00:07:54] [00:07:55] [00:07:57] [00:07:58] [00:08:01]. Using the principle of conservation of energy, the velocity of a particle falling a distance 'y' is found to be proportional to the square root of 'y' (height from the top) [00:08:01] [00:08:03] [00:08:06] [00:08:08] [00:08:11] [00:08:14] [00:08:15] [00:08:18] [00:08:19] [00:08:23] [00:08:24] [00:08:27] [00:08:30] [00:08:31] [00:08:34]. This implies that the speed of light in Bernoulli's analogy should also be proportional to the square root of the distance from the top [00:08:37] [00:08:39] [00:08:41] [00:08:43].

By plugging this expression for the speed of light into Snell's Law for each layer, Bernoulli found that the ratio of the sine of the angle to the square root of 'y' for each layer was constant [00:08:47] [00:08:50] [00:08:51] [00:08:53] [00:08:54] [00:08:56] [00:08:59] [00:09:01] [00:09:04] [00:09:06] [00:09:09] [00:09:12] [00:09:15] [00:09:17] [00:09:22] [00:09:23]. This equation, Bernoulli immediately recognized, was the equation of a cycloid [00:09:28] [00:09:30] [00:09:32].

### The Cycloid: Brachistochrone and Tautochrone

The cycloid is the path traced by a point on the rim of a rolling wheel [00:09:35] [00:09:38] [00:09:40]. This curve is also known as a brachistochrone curve, meaning "shortest time" in Greek [00:09:40] [00:09:43]. The astonishing solution was that the fastest path from A to B is indeed an arc of a cycloid, not a circle [00:09:46] [00:09:48] [00:09:50] [00:09:53] [00:09:56].

The cycloid possesses another surprising property: no matter where a mass is released from on the curve, it always reaches the end at the same time [00:09:58] [00:09:59] [00:10:01] [00:10:04]. For this reason, it is also known as the tautochrone curve, meaning "same time" in Greek [00:10:05] [00:10:08].

## Beyond Mechanics and Optics

Upon discovering this solution, Bernoulli wrote:

I have shown that the two problems taken from entirely separate fields of mathematics have the same character." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>

Little did Bernoulli know, he had stumbled upon something far more profound [00:10:32]. This realization laid groundwork for the principle of least action, a single rule that unifies all of [[Physics and aerodynamic principles | physics]] [00:26:04] [00:26:07] [00:26:09] [00:26:14] [00:26:15] [00:26:18] [00:26:21] [00:26:23] [00:26:25] [00:26:28] [00:26:30] [00:26:32] [00:26:35] [00:26:36] [00:26:39] [00:26:43].

Mosquitoes are known to be more attracted to some people than others, a phenomenon at least partially [[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | genetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding this relationship is crucial due to the significant [[impact_of_mosquitoes_on_human_health | impact of mosquitoes on human health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, as they are considered the most dangerous animal globally, having killed more people than any other single cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Genetic Influence on Mosquito Attraction

[[Research on mosquito preferences | Scientific research]] has identified specific locations on human DNA that make individuals more or less attractive to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

One study used a "Y-tube test," where mosquitoes choose between two arms, one with a human "bait" and one empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This test was used to show that attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially [[the_role_of_dna_in_determining_attractiveness_to_mosquitoes | genetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

A study recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of fraternal female twins. By evaluating their mosquito attractiveness using the Y-tube test, scientists found that the attractiveness of twins was correlated, meaning if one twin was attractive, the other likely was too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Crucially, the correlation was higher for identical twins compared to fraternal twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Since identical twins share more genes, this strongly suggests that [[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | genetics influence]] how attractive a person is to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Researchers estimate that attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

A 2017 study, involving 16,000 participants who rated their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes, conducted a genome-wide association study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This identified seven specific locations on human DNA, involving single-letter changes, associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. These genetic variations can contribute to an individual being significantly protected from mosquitoes or more attractive to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Mechanisms of Attraction and Repulsion

The precise way these genetic changes affect mosquito attraction is unclear, but it is likely related to the odor or volatile chemicals our bodies emit, possibly influenced by the microbiome (bacteria on our skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Mosquitoes are primarily attracted to:
*   **Carbon dioxide** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Individuals with a higher metabolism, those who have exercised, larger people, or pregnant individuals are more likely to attract mosquitoes due to increased CO2 output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   Other **volatile chemicals** such as lactic acid, acetone, and ammonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Conversely, some naturally occurring chemicals repel mosquitoes or impair their ability to find humans, including octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Mosquito Lifecycle and Feeding Habits

Only female mosquitoes bite humans, as they require blood proteins to produce their eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The mosquito lifecycle, from egg to flying adult, takes only two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. After developing, adult mosquitoes seek out vertebrate blood to lay more eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Some strains, like *Aedes aegypti*, are highly specialized in biting humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Co-evolution with Malaria Parasites

A remarkable example of [[evolutionary biology and cooperation | co-evolution]] is seen with the malaria parasite. If a human contracts malaria, the parasite alters the host's body chemistry to produce an odor that makes them *more* attractive to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This is an evolutionary adaptation by the parasite, as mosquitoes are the vectors that transmit malaria to new hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This raises questions about whether humans might also have evolved traits to smell less appealing to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

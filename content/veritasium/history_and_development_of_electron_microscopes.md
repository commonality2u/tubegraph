Directly seeing individual atoms was considered impossible just 30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, advancements in [[principles_of_electron_microscopy_and_waveparticle_duality | electron microscopy]] have made this a reality, allowing visualization at 50 million times magnification, where each blob represents an actual atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Why Atoms Are So Hard to See

Atoms cannot be seen with visible light because light wavelengths (380-750 nanometers) are much larger than an atom (0.1 nanometers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. If the light's wavelength is significantly bigger than the object, the light will diffract or bend around it, preventing direct observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. To see atoms, something with a much smaller wavelength is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Electron as a Wave

The best candidate for seeing atoms is not light, but electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. In 1924, French physicist [[principles_of_electron_microscopy_and_waveparticle_duality | Louis de Broglie]] theorized that everything, not just light but also matter (atoms, molecules, and even people), possessed wavelike properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The formula for this wavelength is [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] divided by an object's momentum (mass times velocity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

In modern electron microscopes, electrons are accelerated to around 80% the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Their calculated wavelength, using de Broglie's formula, is between 2 to 3 picometers, which is over 100,000 times smaller than visible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Theoretically, this allows for 100,000 times more resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Early Electron Microscopes

Shortly after de Broglie's discovery, German scientists began developing a microscope utilizing these high-speed electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The challenge was that electrons cannot be focused using glass lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### The Electromagnetic Lens

Hans Busch, a German physicist, proposed that an electromagnetic lens could focus electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. He published his findings in 1926 but never built one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. His paper, however, inspired Ernst Ruska, a young PhD student. Ruska built his first prototype by coiling wire around iron with a gap in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Passing a current through the coil induced a donut-shaped magnetic field, which served as his lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

To test it, Ruska boiled electrons off a tungsten filament, similar to those found in an [[history_of_the_light_bulb | incandescent light bulb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. These free electrons were then accelerated through a positively charged anode down to the electromagnetic lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The magnetic field exerts a force, called the Lorentz force, on the approaching electron, causing it to spiral into the center of the lens and focus the beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### The Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)

By 1931, Ruska and his colleague Max Knoll used this design to build the first working [[principles_of_electron_microscopy_and_waveparticle_duality | electron microscope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The image was created when the focused electron beam hit an incredibly thin sample (around 100 nanometers thick) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. More electrons passed through thinner parts, creating an electron imprint that was then magnified by a second electromagnetic lens onto a fluorescent detector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This became known as a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Early TEMs barely magnified and were not superior to optical microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. However, Ruska persistently experimented with adding more lenses, achieving over 10,000 times magnification by the mid-1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This allowed for close-ups of insects, bacteria, and even viruses, far surpassing optical microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## The Spherical Aberration Problem

Just as Ruska's TEM gained momentum, German physicist Otto Scherzer published a paper claiming the microscope would hit a fundamental limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He identified an unavoidable flaw in the electromagnetic lens: spherical aberration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Spherical aberration occurs because the magnetic field in an electromagnetic lens does not scale linearly; it's stronger near the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This overdeflects electrons further from the optical axis, causing them to focus before the central rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The result is a blurred focus spread along the optical axis instead of a single point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This blur worsens with higher magnification and affects all radially symmetric magnetic lenses, as well as spherical lenses in cameras and telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

While optical spherical aberration can be minimized by adding a diverging lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, this is physically impossible with magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. All magnetic field lines must form a closed loop, meaning electrons will always cross through two field lines, which always converge the beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Scherzer's paper in 1936 proved the impossibility of a radially symmetric magnetic lens that diverges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This revelation significantly slowed advancements in [[principles_of_electron_microscopy_and_waveparticle_duality | electron microscopy]] resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Alternative Atom Visualization

By 1955, another microscope, the field ion microscope, provided the first generally accepted images of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. It worked by shooting helium or neon atoms at an atomically sharp, positively charged needle tip. Ionized gas atoms were ejected perpendicularly, forming an impression of the tip's atomic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. However, this method was limited to the needle tip and produced less impressive images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Revival and Advancements

Despite Scherzer's limit, work on the TEM continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. British-American physicist Albert Crewe made significant improvements by replacing the random tungsten filament with a more directed electron source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. He pulled electrons off a sharpened tungsten tip with a stronger electric field, creating a narrow beam over a thousand times brighter than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

Crewe paired this with a scanning technology inspired by cathode ray tube TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. His electron beam scanned across the nanoscopic sample, mapping it bit by bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. While German researcher Manfred von Ardenne had built an early scanning TEM prototype in the 1930s (destroyed in WWII) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, Crewe's drastic improvements led to the first image of single atoms taken with an [[principles_of_electron_microscopy_and_waveparticle_duality | electron microscope]] in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

## Probe Microscopes

Around the time of Crewe's work, other microscopes emerged that could also image atoms. These probe microscopes used an incredibly small stylus gliding across a sample, detecting variations in quantum effects or nanoscale forces to map the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. They were easier to build, weren't limited by spherical aberration, and produced 3D images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. However, they were "feeling" atoms rather than "seeing" them directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## The [[role_of_aberrationcorrected_microscopes_in_material_science | Aberration Correction]] Breakthrough

Scherzer's theorem proved that a diverging, radially symmetric magnetic lens was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. However, the theorem no longer applies if radial symmetry is abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Breaking symmetry usually distorts the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### The "Troublemakers"

Knut Urban, Max Haider, and Harold Rose, known as "troublemakers" in the [[principles_of_electron_microscopy_and_waveparticle_duality | electron microscope]] community, pursued a "crazy" idea: purposely distorting the image with a non-symmetric lens in hopes a small part of it would be slightly diverging to correct spherical aberration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

They used a complex system of electromagnets with six, eight, or even ten separate coils, known as hexapole, octopole, and decapole magnets, to create bumpy magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. As the electron beam passed through a hexapole, it would twist and squeeze the 2D image into a triangular saddle, pushing the beam's circumference into three corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Crucially, the middle of the image would develop a slight concave bow, giving a small divergence effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

Then, they forced the beam through a second hexapole that worked in the opposite direction to unbend the distorted image back into a circular shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Their calculations suggested this new image might retain remnants of that tiny divergence in its center, with spherical aberration pointing the opposite way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. If their engineering and math were precise, this setup could almost completely counteract spherical aberration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This idea was considered technically impossible by many in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

### The Breakthrough

By May 1997, with only two months of funding left, their latest lens iteration was still a drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Miraculously, by July 23rd, just a week before funding ran out, the new lens was ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. It initially failed and was unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. After allowing the magnets to settle for 24 hours, they turned it on at 2 a.m. on July 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. The picture began to stabilize, and suddenly, there was no aberration, only clear images of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

After over 60 years of failed attempts, Urban, Rose, and Haider achieved the seemingly impossible, reducing the TEM's resolution to 0.13 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. An average TEM image transformed dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

Their breakthrough quickly spread through the microscopy community, drawing large crowds eager to see their stunningly sharp images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Soon after, Ondrej Krivanek independently achieved the same [[role_of_aberrationcorrected_microscopes_in_material_science | aberration correction]] for Crewe’s scanning TEM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. In 2020, all four scientists were awarded the prestigious Kavli Prize in Nanoscience for their accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

## Modern Significance

[[role_of_aberrationcorrected_microscopes_in_material_science | Aberration correction]] has been a game-changer for [[advancements_in_atom_visualization_technology | seeing atoms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. It is now essential for measuring atomic distances and identifying atom types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. In fields like [[role_of_aberrationcorrected_microscopes_in_material_science | material science]], materials engineering, and chemical engineering, understanding atomic-level structure is crucial for relating properties to structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Without it, only half the information would be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Today, every university requires such a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The **Store Now, Decrypt Later (SNDL)** method is a procedure in which [[Nation-state | nation states]] and individual actors intercept and store large amounts of encrypted data that they cannot currently decrypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This data includes sensitive information like passwords, bank details, and social security numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The rationale behind this practice is the belief that within the next 10 to 20 years, they will gain access to a [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computer]] capable of breaking existing encryption methods in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Motivation and Targeted Data

The effectiveness of SNDL relies on the principle that information valuable today will still hold significant value in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This includes:
*   Industrial and pharmaceutical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Top-secret government intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

The threat posed by future [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computers]] to current encryption schemes is widely acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The National Security Administration (NSA) has stated that a sufficiently large [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computer]], if built, could undermine all widely deployed [[public_key_cryptography_and_rsa | public key algorithms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Experts predict that [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computing]] will break encryption as we know it today within a five to ten-year timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Even though sufficiently powerful [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computers]] are still years away, their anticipated arrival makes SNDL an immediate threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Response to the Threat

Due to the looming threat of SNDL, the U.S. Congress has passed legislation mandating that all agencies begin transitioning immediately to new methods of [[postquantum_cryptography_and_latticebased_encryption | cryptography]] that are resistant to [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computer]] attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

This shift is necessary because current [[public_key_cryptography_and_rsa | encryption schemes]], such as [[public_key_cryptography_and_rsa | RSA]], which have been effective for over 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, are vulnerable to [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computers]]. Shor's algorithm, discovered in 1994 by Peter Shor and Don Coppersmith, demonstrates how a [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computer]] can efficiently factor large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This capability directly undermines [[public_key_cryptography_and_rsa | RSA]] encryption, which relies on the computational difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The number of physical qubits estimated to break [[public_key_cryptography_and_rsa | RSA]] encryption has dramatically decreased:
*   **2012:** 1 billion physical qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>
*   **2017:** 230 million physical qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>
*   **2019:** 20 million physical qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>

While current [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computers]] like IBM's are far from these numbers, the exponential progress in [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computing]] development indicates a future collision point where existing [[public_key_cryptography_and_rsa | public key encryption]] will no longer be secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

Scientists are actively developing [[postquantum_cryptography_and_latticebased_encryption | new encryption methods]] designed to withstand attacks from both conventional and [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition in 2016 to identify such algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. On July 5th, 2022, NIST selected four algorithms, primarily based on the mathematics of lattices, to be part of their [[postquantum_cryptography_and_latticebased_encryption | post-quantum cryptographic standard]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. These [[postquantum_cryptography_and_latticebased_encryption | lattice-based encryption]] methods are designed to be extremely difficult for even the most powerful [[quantum_computing_and_encryption | quantum computers]] to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

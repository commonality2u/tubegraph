[[Soft robots and their applications | Soft robots]] are being considered by NASA for studying the surfaces of other planets due to their unique growth mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49">[11:49]</a>. Their design makes them particularly well-suited for burrowing into granular materials like sand or soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43">[10:43]</a>.

## Advantages over Traditional Burrowing Robots

A previous mission to Mars, the InSight mission, encountered difficulties with its heat probe, which was designed to hammer its way down into the Martian core to detect temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01">[12:01]</a>. The probe became stuck because the material it was placed in was more cohesive than anticipated, and there wasn't enough friction between the probe and the sand to allow it to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21">[12:21]</a>. The hammering mechanism relied on friction to push against the surrounding material and move deeper, but without sufficient friction, it merely pounded in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30">[12:30]</a>.

In contrast, vine robots operate by tip extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36">[11:36]</a>. This method means they do not rely on the interaction with the surrounding material to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47">[12:47]</a>. By blowing a jet of air out the front of the robot, the sand or granular material can be fluidized, making it behave like a liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27">[11:27]</a>. This fluidization reduces the force of the sand, allowing the robot to extend its way through the material without needing friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30">[11:30]</a>. This characteristic makes vine robots an attractive option for future planetary exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49">[11:49]</a>.

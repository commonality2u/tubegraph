The VARK model is a prominent theory within education that proposes individuals have preferred ways of learning, known as [[learning styles myth | learning styles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This idea suggests that if information is presented in accordance with a person's specific learning style, they will learn more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Four VARK Learning Styles

The VARK model identifies four primary learning styles:
*   **Visual** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>: These learners are thought to learn best from images, demonstrations, and pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Auditory** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>: Individuals with this style reportedly learn best from listening to explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Reading-writing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>: Learners are believed to excel by reading and writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Kinesthetic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>: Often described as "hands-on," these learners are said to learn best by doing and physically interacting with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Intuitive Appeal and Belief

The concept of [[learning styles myth | learning styles]], including VARK, makes intuitive sense to many because it acknowledges that everyone is different, with varying strengths such as spatial reasoning, listening comprehension, reading ability, or dexterity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This aligns with a cultural belief that "we're all unique, we're all different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

A survey of nearly 400 teachers from the UK and the Netherlands revealed that over 90% believed individuals learn better when information is received in their preferred [[learning styles myth | learning style]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The VARK website itself claims that understanding VARK will provide a "revelation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Origins

The VARK model was developed by Neil Fleming, a school inspector in New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Fleming observed that some excellent teachers failed to reach certain learners, while some less effective teachers succeeded with others, and he sought to explain this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. He found that "preferred modes of learning" seemed to offer "some magic, some explanatory power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. However, the model was not based on a study that showed students naturally cluster into four distinct groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Lack of Empirical Evidence

Despite its popularity, rigorous studies have consistently found no credible evidence supporting the existence or utility of distinct [[learning styles myth | learning styles]] like those proposed by the VARK model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

To test the hypothesis, researchers conduct randomized control trials where learners with different self-identified styles are randomly assigned to educational presentations that either match or mismatch their stated preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The learning styles hypothesis predicts better performance when the presentation matches the learning style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

For instance, one study compared visualizers and verbalizers and found that students whose preferred style matched their instruction performed no better on tests than those whose instruction was mismatched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This result was replicated with non-college-educated adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Furthermore, a 2018 study with over 400 university students found that an overwhelming majority used study [[memory strategies | strategies]] supposedly incompatible with their VARK-classified [[learning styles myth | learning style]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The minority who did align their strategies with their style did not perform significantly differently on course assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Review articles consistently conclude that there is no credible evidence for the existence of [[learning styles myth | learning styles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Researchers note that the contrast between the widespread popularity of [[learning styles myth | learning styles]] and the lack of credible evidence for their utility is "striking and disturbing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

One reason people find [[learning styles myth | learning styles]] convincing is confirmation bias: they already believe in their own learning style and interpret experiences (like a helpful diagram) as evidence for it, rather than considering that the instructional method itself might simply be effective for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

While some tasks naturally require a particular sensory input (e.g., music for auditory, maps for visual geography) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, the claim of [[learning styles myth | learning style]] theories is that these preferences are consistent across *all* learning domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This is not supported by evidence; for example, most people would learn geography better with a map, regardless of their self-identified "auditory" preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Effective Learning Strategies

Instead of focusing on [[learning styles myth | learning styles]], research supports that everyone learns better through [[multimodal_learning | multimodal approaches]] where words and pictures are presented together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This is known as the multimedia effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> and highlights why videos that complement visuals with narration are powerful learning tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The most crucial factor for learning is what happens inside the learner's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. People learn best when they are actively thinking about the material, solving problems, or imagining scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Effective teaching methods are evidence-based and improve learning for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The misconception of [[learning styles myth | learning styles]] can actually hinder learning by giving teachers unnecessary concerns and making some students reluctant to engage with certain types of instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Time and money spent on [[learning styles myth | learning styles]] could be better allocated to interventions that genuinely improve learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

Ultimately, individuals are not confined to a single learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic); rather, they are "all these kinds of learner in one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. The most effective learning experiences involve multiple ways of understanding the same material, a strategy beneficial for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

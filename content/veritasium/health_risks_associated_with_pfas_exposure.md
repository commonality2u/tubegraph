Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as "forever chemicals," are a family of over 14,000 different manmade chemicals covered in carbon-fluorine bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. These chemicals are highly stable and persistent, leading to their widespread contamination of the environment and living organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.

## Early Discoveries and Corporate Concealment

In 1961, DuPont's in-house scientists conducted tests on C8 (PFOA), a specific PFAS used in Teflon manufacturing. They found that ingesting as little as 1.5 milligrams of C8 per kilogram of body weight caused abnormal liver growth in rats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. A dose of 570 milligrams per kilogram was lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. While less fatal than sodium cyanide (5-15 mg/kg lethal dose), C8 was concerning because it wouldn't break down in the environment for decades due to its stable carbon-fluorine bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

Moreover, C8 resembles fatty acids essential for human and animal functioning, raising concerns that it could enter the bloodstream, bind to proteins, and accumulate throughout the body, potentially disrupting organ systems like the liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

Further studies by DuPont confirmed these toxic effects:
*   **1962**: High doses of C8 killed rats, causing injury to the stomach, intestine, brain, lungs, and pancreas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   **1965**: The same toxic effects were observed in dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Later**: Studies on monkeys showed some dropping dead, with chemicals causing toxic effects across multiple organ systems and species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

Despite this accumulating evidence, these studies were not shared with the scientific community or the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.

## Widespread Contamination

In 1975, researchers investigating inorganic fluoride levels in US blood samples discovered another type of fluorine: organic fluorine (carbon-fluorine bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. This organic fluorine did not follow the same trend as inorganic fluoride, indicating a non-naturally occurring source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. They traced it to chemicals like PFOA made by 3M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

Subsequent internal checks by 3M and DuPont revealed that their workers were contaminated with C8 at levels 1,000 times higher than those found in the general population, and many showed signs of liver disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

By the early 1980s, a cancer study in rats confirmed that PFOA causes testicular tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. DuPont's own samples around their Washington Works factory in West Virginia confirmed C8 contamination in the Ohio River and the public water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

By 2000, researchers found C8 in 100% of blood samples from thousands of Americans across the country, at an average of five parts per billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. Today, almost every living creature, from polar bears to fish, shows signs of PFAS contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## Specific Health Impacts of PFAS

A 2013 independent science panel confirmed a probable link between C8 exposure and six human diseases based on studies in the Parkersburg community:
*   Thyroid disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>
*   Testicular cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>
*   Kidney cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>
*   Ulcerative colitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a> (not specified in given text as one of the six, but generally associated with C8)
*   High cholesterol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a> (not specified in given text as one of the six, but generally associated with C8)
*   Pregnancy-induced hypertension/preeclampsia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a> (not specified in given text as one of the six, but generally associated with C8)

For example, a person with more than 30 parts per billion of C8 in their blood serum might have about double the odds of developing kidney cancer compared to the general population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. The true risk might be even higher as studies often excluded individuals who may have already died from C8 exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

### GenX

After C8 was phased out, DuPont's spinoff company, Chemours, began using GenX, a shorter-chain PFAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. A subsequent cancer study revealed that GenX causes the exact same three tumors in rats as PFOA: liver, testicular, and pancreatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. Its shorter chain also makes GenX more mobile, potentially contaminating larger areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

### General Perfluoroalkyl Acids

A 2022 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on seven perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAS) provided guidance on blood levels:
*   **Below 2 parts per billion (ppb)**: No expected harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.
*   **Between 2 and 20 ppb**: Potential for harmful health effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.
*   **Above 20 ppb**: Greater risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

While the exact mechanism of harm isn't fully understood, exposure to these PFAS has consistently been associated with:
*   High cholesterol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>
*   Decreased immune system response to vaccines and infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>
*   Kidney cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>
*   Decreased growth in infants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>

PFAS have also been linked to dozens of other conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

## Types of PFAS and Absorption

Not all PFAS are equally dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>:
*   **Fluoropolymers** (e.g., Teflon): These are long, inert chains of carbon-fluorine bonds (tens or hundreds of thousands of atoms long) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. They are too large and inert to be absorbed into the bloodstream and are generally flushed out by the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   **Processing Aids** (e.g., PFOA, GenX, perfluoroalkyl acids): These molecules are typically 5 to 10 carbons long, small enough to enter the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>. They have functional groups (often acids) that allow them to bind to blood proteins and be transported throughout the body, accumulating over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. Most of the current knowledge about PFAS health effects relates to these perfluoroalkyl acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Polymer Fume Fever
> If Teflon is heated to 350 degrees Celsius, it can release fumes that cause "polymer fume fever," characterized by mild symptoms like fatigue, chest tightness, and headaches, typically passing within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. These fumes are much more toxic to pet birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Exposure Routes

The three main ways people are exposed to PFAS are:

### 1. PFAS-Containing Products
While direct skin exposure to PFAS in products like waterproof clothing or stain-resistant furniture is likely low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>, the bigger problem is how easily PFAS from these products can enter the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>. Factories that make these products often have poor containment records, leading to environmental release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

### 2. Food
Much of our food exposure comes from PFAS-treated packaging, such as takeout boxes, microwave popcorn bags, and burger wrappers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. Chemicals can leach into oils and food, especially when heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. Studies show that eating fast food and microwave popcorn can increase PFAS load, while home-cooked meals do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. Reheating food on a plate instead of in original packaging can help reduce this exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

### 3. Water
Water is the biggest source of PFAS exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. PFAS accumulates in the body over time, meaning even small concentrations (e.g., 4 parts per trillion of PFOA) in drinking water, combined with other exposures, can lead to high blood levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.

Contamination is particularly high near PFAS factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>, military bases, or airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>, due to the use of PFAS in firefighting foams that seep into soil and groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. The entire water cycle is now contaminated, with unsafe levels of at least four PFAS species found even in rainwater on the Tibetan Plateau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

> [!INFO] US EPA Drinking Water Limits
> In April 2024, the US EPA set legal limits for PFAS in drinking water:
> *   **PFOA**: 4 parts per trillion (ppt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.
> *   **PFOS**: 4 ppt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
> *   **GenX**: 10 ppt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.
> *   **PFHxS**: 10 ppt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.
> These limits are significantly lower than those for lead (10,000 ppt) or cyanide (200,000 ppt), indicating the scientific community's high concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

While PFAS exposure is widespread (98% of the population has detectable levels in their blood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>, the overall [[health_risks_associated_with_smoking_and_radiation_exposure | health risk]] from average exposure levels is considered lower than factors like smoking, lack of exercise, poor diet, or insufficient sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

However, certain populations are at higher risk:
*   **Pregnant people and infants**: PFAS can pass through the placenta to the fetus and be transferred via breast milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Young children are highly susceptible due to increased water consumption, growth rates, and proximity to contaminated surfaces like carpets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.
*   **Firefighters**: They have especially high PFAS levels due to exposure to PFAS-laced gear and firefighting foams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.
*   **Individuals in contaminated areas**: Those living or working near PFAS factories, military bases, or airports.

### Reducing PFAS Levels

*   **Water Filtration**: If water is contaminated, consider a PFAS-certified filter (reverse osmosis, granulated active carbon, or ion exchange filters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.
*   **Dietary Changes**: Reduce consumption of fast food and microwave popcorn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.
*   **Blood/Plasma Donation**: A 2022 study found that firefighters who frequently donated blood or plasma reduced their PFAS levels by up to 30% within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. While not a primary recommendation for the general public, it's an interesting finding.

> [!NOTE] Regulatory Outlook
> The responsibility for filtering drinking water should ideally fall on manufacturing processes, not individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. While some countries are banning PFAS in certain products like hygiene products, cosmetics, and food packaging, a complete ban is not yet feasible due to reliance on PFAS for essential items like medical implants and semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. The situation is reminiscent of past public health challenges with [[impact_of_leaded_gasoline_on_public_health_and_environment | leaded gasoline]], Freon, and asbestos, where research led to their eventual phase-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Consumer awareness and demand are driving companies to voluntarily remove these chemicals from products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.

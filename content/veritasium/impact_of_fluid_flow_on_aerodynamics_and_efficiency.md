Fluid flow significantly impacts aerodynamics and efficiency, particularly distinguishing between [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar]] and [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]]. While [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] is often seen as "pretty" and "well-behaved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] is a "mess" and is "literally definitionally chaotic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, lacking a universally agreed-upon definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. However, [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] is the more common state in everyday life and the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Laminar vs. Turbulent Flow
[[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | Laminar flow]] is characterized by fluid particles moving parallel to each other in organized layers or laminae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It occurs at low [[reynolds_number_and_its_role_in_fluid_dynamics | Reynolds numbers]], limiting it to low speeds, small sizes, or viscous fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

[[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | Turbulent flow]], conversely, is unpredictable, messy, and sensitively dependent on initial conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It consists of many interacting swirls of fluid, also known as eddies or vortices, which can span a huge range of sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | Turbulent flow]] is diffusive, meaning it mixes things like dye, heat, or momentum throughout the fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It is also dissipative, consuming energy from larger eddies and transferring it down to smaller eddies, eventually dissipating as heat, thus requiring a constant energy source to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Boundary Layers and Drag
When fluid flows over a surface, a boundary layer formsâ€”a region where fluid velocity adjusts from zero at the surface (due to friction and adhesion) to the free stream velocity further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. The force exerted by the fluid on the surface within this layer is known as skin friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

If the fluid velocity is high or the surface is long, a [[comparison_between_turbulent and_laminar_flow | laminar]] boundary layer can transition to a [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. In a [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] boundary layer, the fluid swirls and mixes, bringing faster-flowing fluid closer to the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This mixing increases skin friction, resulting in significantly more drag than [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar]] boundary layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Applications in Aerodynamics and Efficiency

### Aircraft
Aircraft experience significant drag from skin friction in their mostly [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] boundary layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. To reduce drag and save fuel, aircraft surfaces are designed to be as smooth as possible, as small obstacles or rough surfaces can "trip" [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar]] boundary layers into becoming [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This is why planes are frequently washed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

However, sometimes inducing [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] is beneficial. Small fins called vortex generators are added to wings to cause [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This mixes faster-flowing air closer to the surface, energizing the flow over the wing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This energized flow can follow the wing's curve for longer, preventing flow separation and stall, which dramatically decreases lift, especially at low speeds or high angles of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Therefore, [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] is sometimes induced for efficient flight and climbing at higher angles of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Golf Balls
Early smooth golf balls did not fly as far as dimpled or "nicked" ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. A smooth ball creates a [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar]] boundary layer with low skin friction, but this flow separates easily, leaving a large wake of low-pressure [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] air behind the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This large wake causes significant pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

Dimples on a golf ball force the boundary layer to become [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. A [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] boundary layer can remain attached to the ball's surface for longer before separating, which significantly reduces the size of the turbulent wake and thus the pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This reduction in pressure drag outweighs the increase in skin friction drag, allowing golf balls to travel further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The drag coefficient can drop by almost a factor of two when the boundary layer becomes [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Vortex Shedding and Energy Harnessing
When fluid flows around an object, like a cylinder, under the right conditions, vortices are shed alternately from each side, forming a regular pattern downstream known as a von Karman Vortex Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. While not strictly [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] due to its predictability, this phenomenon is part of the transition to [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Scientists are investigating ways to harness the energy contained in these vortex structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. For example, some fish can take advantage of [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] water to swim more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

In summary, while [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] might appear simpler, [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] is pervasive and essential for many [[applications_and_significance_of_turbulent_flow_in_nature_and_technology | applications and natural phenomena]], including flight, the formation of raindrops, and the performance of sports equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

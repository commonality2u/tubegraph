From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

An [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]] is a structure formed by diffuse material orbiting a massive central body, such as a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], under the influence of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This material gradually spirals inward towards the central body.

The [[First image of a black hole by Event Horizon Telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] released what is likely to be the [[Firstever image of a black hole | first-ever image of a black hole]] on April 10th, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] specifically observed is Sagittarius A*, located at the center of our Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] is surrounded by an [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Accretion Disk

The [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]] is composed of dust and gas swirling chaotically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
Key characteristics include:
*   **Temperature** The material in the disk is incredibly hot, reaching millions of degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Speed** The matter moves at a significant fraction of the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Growth** The [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] feeds off this matter, growing larger over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO)

The [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]] does not extend all the way to the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This is due to the presence of an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For a non-spinning [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], this orbit is located at three [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | Schwarzschild radii]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If matter goes inside this orbit, it quickly spirals into the center of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

While the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] at the center of the Milky Way is likely spinning, models often simplify by considering the non-spinning case for explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Appearance of the Accretion Disk

If there were no matter around a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], it would be impossible to image because it absorbs all [[use_of_electromagnetic_waves_to_view_black_holes | electromagnetic radiation]] that falls on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The light from the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]] is what allows us to "see" the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]]'s shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The way light rays are warped by the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]]'s gravity significantly affects the appearance of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Viewing Angle Effects
The image of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]] depends on the observer's viewing angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Perpendicular View** If observed perpendicular to the disk, one would see the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]]'s shadow with the disk material around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Edge-on View** When viewed edge-on, the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]]'s warping of space-time causes light rays from the back of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]] to bend over the top, appearing as if they are coming from the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Similarly, light from the bottom of the disk can bend underneath the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] and appear to come from the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This can create an image resembling the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] from the movie *Interstellar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Multiple Images** Light from the top of the disk can go around the back of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], graze the [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | photon sphere]], and appear as a very thin ring underneath the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Similarly, light from underneath the disk can bend around the back and appear over the top, forming another ring of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Relativistic Beaming
Due to the high speeds of matter in the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]], [[Relativistic beaming and plasma orbiting black holes | relativistic beaming]] (also known as Doppler beaming) occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This effect causes the side of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]] that is moving towards the observer to appear much brighter than the side moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This phenomenon creates a distinct bright spot in the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Observing how "blobs" of matter move in the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | accretion disk]] over time could provide further insights into [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

Planes typically fly at high altitudes, around 30,000 to 43,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The real answer for why planes fly so high is primarily economic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, though it also offers benefits for a smoother ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Benefits of High-Altitude Flight

### Reduced Air Resistance and Fuel Efficiency
At altitudes such as 33,000 feet (10 km), the air density is only about a third of what it is at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This reduced density means the plane encounters fewer air molecules, allowing it to fly about 73% faster for the same amount of thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. As a result, flights reach their destination faster and burn less fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While climbing consumes more fuel (approximately 80 kg/minute), cruising burns about 40 kg/minute, and descent is almost negligible at 10 kg/minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Engine Efficiency
Jet engines operate more efficiently in colder air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. At cruising altitudes, temperatures are around -50 degrees Celsius, significantly colder than the average +15 degrees Celsius at ground level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This cold environment enhances the efficiency of the combustion process within the engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Weather Avoidance
Flying at high altitudes, specifically high in the troposphere, means there is less turbulence and fewer storms to navigate around, as most weather occurs in this layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Pilots can also utilize jet stream tailwinds for further fuel savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Challenges and Safety Measures at Altitude

### Unbreathable Air and [[Cabin pressurization and airplane structural integrity | Cabin Pressurization]]
The air at high altitudes is unbreathable due to significantly lower air pressure and partial pressure of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. At 10 km (approximately 33,000 ft), the air pressure is only a quarter of that at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For normal human function, an oxygen partial pressure of at least 16 kilopascals is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Therefore, all airplane cabins cruising at high altitudes must be pressurized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. A small amount of air is continuously drawn from the compression stage of the jet engines to maintain breathable air inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This process slightly reduces engine efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### [[Airplane door mechanics and safety | Airplane Door Mechanics]]
The necessity of [[Cabin pressurization and airplane structural integrity | cabin pressurization]] led to a fundamental redesign of aircraft doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Unlike older planes where doors opened outward and pressure was uniform on both sides, modern pressurized planes have doors shaped like plugs, wider on the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This design ensures that the higher internal cabin pressure pushes the door into its frame, creating an airtight seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The pressure difference is so immense that it is impossible for a person to open these doors mid-flight, as it would require a force equivalent to lifting 9,000 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Even modern doors that appear to open outward are cleverly designed plugs. For example, a Boeing 737's main passenger door is wider and taller than its frame, requiring internal folding and rotation to open, which is impossible at altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Cabin Pressure Levels and Structural Integrity
Airplane cabins are not fully pressurized to sea-level pressure (101.3 kilopascals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. At cruising altitude, cabin pressure typically drops to around 77 kilopascals, ensuring the oxygen partial pressure remains at the minimum required 16 kilopascals for passengers to feel normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

This partial pressurization is a deliberate safety measure to minimize stress on the aircraft's fuselage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Each flight cycle involves the fuselage stretching and relaxing due to pressure changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Minimizing this stress helps extend the plane's lifespan and prevent fatigue, cracking, and corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

A notable example of structural failure due to fatigue was Aloha Airlines Flight 243 in 1988, where a small crack widened at 24,000 feet, causing the plane's roof to tear off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This incident occurred on a plane with nearly 90,000 flight cycles, far exceeding its design limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### In-Flight Door Opening Incidents
While rare, a door can be opened in flight if the pressure differential is minimal. In May 2023, a passenger on an Airbus managed to open an emergency exit during final approach when the plane was quite close to the ground, and the pressure difference was very small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Other Altitude-Related Effects

### Physiological Effects on the Body
The lower cabin pressure can cause gases in the body to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This is why a bag of chips inflates during flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The expansion of gases in bodily cavities can lead to increased flatulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### [[Airplane food taste and cabin environment effects | Airplane Food Taste]]
The taste of food on an airplane can be affected by the cabin environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The air pumped into the cabin is very dry, with relative humidity as low as 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This dryness can dehydrate nasal passages, impairing the sense of smell and, consequently, taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The lower cabin pressure can also diminish the intensity of flavors like salt and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

Interestingly, the umami (savory) taste appears to be enhanced in flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. A 2015 study suggests that loud cabin noise might unintentionally stimulate the chorda tympani nerve, which carries taste information, thereby boosting the perception of umami flavors found in foods like tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This might explain why many passengers order tomato juice or Bloody Marys on flights, even if they don't consume them on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

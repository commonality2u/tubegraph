While [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | Signaling System No. 7 (SS7)]] remains broadly in use today, it may not be as secure as widely believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Experts like Karsten Nohl and Alexandre De Oliveira have demonstrated how [[exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_phone_systems | SS7 vulnerabilities can be exploited]] to intercept phone calls, steal two-factor passcodes, and track location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These attacks can be done remotely without touching the target's phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

The [[impact_of_mobile_phone_security_breaches | threats are real]] and can have devastating consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. For example, criminals have used [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] to intercept SMS two-factor authentication codes and empty millions of dollars from bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

## Individual Protection Measures

While there isn't much an individual can do about location tracking as long as they have a SIM card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:08">[02:09:08]</a>, certain steps can enhance personal security against other forms of [[exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_phone_systems | SS7 attacks]]:

### 1. Avoid SMS-Based Two-Factor Authentication

SMS two-factor authentication is almost the default for many accounts, but it is vulnerable to interception via [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:08">[02:09:08]</a>. Attackers can trick the network into thinking the target is roaming, rerouting messages to their own Global Title (GT) and allowing them to steal one-time passwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>.

*   **Recommendation:** If possible, choose alternatives to SMS-based two-factor authentication so messages cannot be intercepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:11">[02:09:11]</a>.
*   **Alternatives:**
    *   **Authenticator Apps:** Use an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy) which generates time-based one-time passwords directly on your device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:18">[02:09:18]</a>.
    *   **Hardware Tokens:** Utilize physical hardware tokens (e.g., YubiKey) for authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:20">[02:09:20]</a>.

### 2. Use Encrypted Internet-Based Calling Services

[[exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_phone_systems | SS7 attacks]] can enable phone tapping, allowing third parties to sit on the line and record calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>.

*   **Recommendation:** If worried about phone tapping, use encrypted internet-based calling services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:21">[02:09:21]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Signal or WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:25">[02:09:25]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Experts indicate that interception attempts are "far less common" compared to tracking attempts, which number in the millions per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>. Targets are generally those of interest to state agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:15">[02:25:15]</a>.

## The Broader Context

The reliance on [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] persists because it forms the backbone of 2G and 3G communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>. While newer protocols introduced with 5G are more secure, a "first mover disadvantage" prevents widespread adoption, creating a tremendous amount of inertia to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:50">[02:57:50]</a>. It could be another 10 to 20 years until [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] networks are finally switched off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:41">[02:41:41]</a>.

Ultimately, the issue of privacy against such intrusions becomes a philosophical question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:32">[02:50:32]</a>. Some argue that privacy and the ability to form one's own thoughts without being observed are prerequisites for democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:47">[02:50:47]</a>, while others might contend "nothing to hide, nothing to fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

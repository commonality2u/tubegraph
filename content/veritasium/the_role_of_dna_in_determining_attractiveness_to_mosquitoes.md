It is a scientifically recognized phenomenon that mosquitoes are more attracted to some individuals than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This differential attraction is, at least partially, influenced by [[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | genetic factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Mosquito Biology and Lifecycle

Only female mosquitoes bite, as they require blood proteins to produce their eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The eggs develop into wriggly larvae, then pupae, before becoming flying adult mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The entire mosquito lifecycle takes just two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. One exotic strain of mosquitoes maintained by Professor Immo Hansen at New Mexico State University is exclusively fed with his own blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Testing Mosquito Attraction: The Y-Tube Method

To assess individual attractiveness to mosquitoes, [[research_on_mosquito_preferences | research on mosquito preferences]] often utilizes a Y-tube apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This setup consists of a holding chamber for mosquitoes, with two arms extending from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. A fan creates a slight draft, and a "bait" (e.g., a human hand) is placed in one of the chambers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. To maximize the attractant, participants are advised to rub their hand first to release oils and sweat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The *Aedes aegypti* mosquito species, used in some tests, is highly specialized and almost exclusively feeds on humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

In an initial test with 20 mosquitoes, a participant's hand was placed in one arm, while the other arm remained empty as a control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The mosquitoes overwhelmingly chose the arm with the human, indicating strong attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Genetic Basis of Attraction: Twin Studies

The Y-tube test has been instrumental in discovering that the basis for mosquito attractiveness is at least partially [[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | genetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. A study recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non-identical (fraternal) female twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The mosquito attractiveness of each twin was measured by the fraction of mosquitoes that flew to their arm in the Y-tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

The study found that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is correlated, meaning if one twin is attractive, the other is likely to be too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Crucially, the correlation was higher for identical twins compared to fraternal twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This strongly suggests that [[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | genetics]] influence how attractive an individual is to mosquitoes, as identical twins share more genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Personal Genetic Analysis and Attractiveness

Anecdotal evidence often suggests differences in mosquito attraction within households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. A Y-tube test comparing a participant known to be often bitten and his wife, who typically is not, showed that the participant attracted more mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While this single test wasn't rigorously scientific, it reproduced their real-world experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

To further investigate, DNA samples were analyzed focusing on seven specific genetic locations identified in a 2017 study involving 23andMe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This study used a genome-wide association study approach, analyzing DNA from 16,000 participants who rated their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. It pinpointed seven single-letter changes (SNPs) in DNA associated with varying levels of mosquito attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

In the personal analysis:
*   Four of the seven locations showed identical DNA between the participant and his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   At the first differing location, the wife had a letter change associated with significantly *decreased* attractiveness to mosquitoes (protection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The participant had no such change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   At the second differing location, the participant had a letter change making him *less* attractive (more protected) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The wife's protective change was twice as significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   At the third differing location, the participant had two copies of a variant associated with *increased* attractiveness to mosquitoes, while his wife had none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This was the only SNP linked to being *more* attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Overall, the genetic results were consistent with observed differences in mosquito attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Attraction and Repulsion

While the exact mechanisms are unclear, genetic changes likely influence the odor or volatile chemicals given off by the body, as well as the skin microbiome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Key attractants for mosquitoes include:
*   **Carbon dioxide**: Higher metabolism, recent exercise, larger body size, or pregnancy can increase CO2 output and thus attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   Other volatile compounds: Lactic acid, acetone, and ammonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Conversely, some naturally occurring chemicals can repel mosquitoes or impair their ability to find humans:
*   Octanal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   Nonanal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   Decanal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>

## Significance and Evolutionary Aspects

The heritability of mosquito attractiveness is estimated to be as significant as height or IQ, underscoring the substantial role of [[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | genetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Understanding this relationship is crucial due to the immense [[impact_of_mosquitoes_on_human_health | impact of mosquitoes on human health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Mosquitoes are considered the most dangerous animal to humans, having potentially killed more people than any other single cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Over a million people die annually from mosquito-borne illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

One fascinating [[evolutionary_aspects_of_human_interaction_with_mosquitoes | evolutionary aspect]] involves malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. If a human contracts malaria, their body chemistry changes to produce an odor that makes them *more* attractive to mosquitoes, allowing the malaria parasite to more effectively transmit itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Genetic Testing and Research

Companies like 23andMe, named for the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, offer genetic testing to help individuals understand their genetic code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. While the mosquito attractiveness test is not currently available to the public, users can opt into [[research_on_mosquito_preferences | research]] and access information about physical traits, health aspects, and ancestry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

The Gordon Dam is a significant structure located in Tasmania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It stands 126.5 meters (or 415 feet) high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Role in Demonstrating the Magnus Effect

The dam has been utilized for practical demonstrations of the [[magnus_effect | Magnus effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. When a basketball was dropped from the dam's edge without any spin, it landed almost directly below the point of release, with only minor deviation due to the breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. However, when another basketball was dropped with a bit of backspin, it exhibited a dramatic horizontal trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Bret, who performed the drop, expressed surprise at how the ball "just took off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### The Magnus Effect Explained

The [[magnus_effect | Magnus effect]] describes the force exerted on a spinning object moving through a fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. As a spinning basketball gains speed, the air on the side of the ball rotating in the same direction as the airflow is dragged along and deflected backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Conversely, on the other side, where the air moves opposite to the ball's spin, the airflow separates from the ball instead of being deflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The overall result is that the ball pushes air in one direction, causing the air to apply an equal and opposite force on the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This phenomenon was described by Heinrich Gustav Magnus in 1852, from whom it takes its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Notably, [[Isaac Newton]] had described a similar effect concerning the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College nearly two centuries earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Applications of the Magnus Effect

The [[magnus_effect | Magnus effect]] is crucial in various sports, including tennis, soccer, and golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. It also has non-sport applications:
*   **Flettner Rotors**: These spinning cylinders can replace traditional sails on ships. They use the [[magnus_effect | Magnus effect]] to deflect crosswinds and propel the vessel forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Aircraft**: Experimental planes have been designed with spinning cylinders instead of wings. While these cylinders can generate more lift than conventional wings through the [[magnus_effect | Magnus effect]], they also produce significantly more drag, rendering them impractical for most uses; one such experimental plane flew only once before crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

However, the [[magnus_effect | Magnus effect]] is seeing a resurgence in modern applications:
*   **Rotor Wing Aircraft**: An experimental rotor wing aircraft is being developed that generates all its lift from spinning cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **E-Ship 1**: This vessel incorporates four Flettner rotors to enhance its efficiency and reduce diesel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The [[magnus_effect | Magnus effect]] has the potential to aid in future innovations beyond just basketballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## World Record Attempt

Beyond scientific demonstrations, the Gordon Dam was also the site where the YouTube channel "How Ridiculous" attempted to set a world record for the highest basket ever scored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

In Australia, a country where "everything is trying to kill you," particularly snakes and spiders, facilities like the Australian Reptile Park play a crucial role in saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. They milk snakes and spiders to collect their venom, which is then used to create antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This process takes place in what is considered "the most dangerous room in the country," where venomous snakes are surrounded floor to ceiling, held only by small locks and thin glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Globally, the World Health Organization estimates 120,000 people die annually from snake bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. In Australia, fatalities are significantly lower, at one to three people per year, due to the availability of some of the best antivenom products and a federally funded program that provides antivenom for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Venom Extraction Process

The extraction process, known as "milking," is a highly dangerous and precise operation.

### Handling Venomous Snakes

Keepers use hooks to manage the snakes, initially pinning them for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The target for venom collection is a small vial, often referred to as a "shot glass," held by the assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Snakes instinctively aim for fingers, not the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. After a bite, the venom glands (considered the snake's "cheeks") are massaged to extract every possible drop, as "every drop matters" for antivenom production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Returning the snake to its enclosure is the "sketchy bit," a test of who's quicker between handler and snake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The process often leaves handlers with trembling hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Approximately 15 snakes are needed to produce one vial of antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Species Used for Extraction

The Australian Reptile Park houses some of the most toxic snakes on the planet, including the Coastal Taipan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> and the Inland Taipan (also known as the fierce snake), which is the most toxic land snake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. One drop of Inland Taipan venom can incapacitate 100 adult humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

The park selectively breeds snakes to produce more venom than their wild counterparts, with some Coastal Taipans yielding five to seven times the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This is achieved by breeding the "most psychotic ones" together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Some snakes can produce up to 4.9 grams of venom per bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. While selective breeding increases venom yield, venom expert Timothy Jackson suggests that regular milking also causes snakes to produce more venom compared to wild snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## The Nature of Snake Venom

[[evolution_of_snake_venom_and_fangs | Venom evolved]] from saliva and is primarily used for catching and digesting prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Each species has a unique venom tailored to its specific prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Evolution of Fangs

Initially, venom was squirted into a snake's mouth by rear teeth, and nearly two-thirds of all snakes remain rear-fanged today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This is because the venom gland is located behind the eye, making the shortest duct path downwards to the back of the top jaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Over time, [[evolution_of_snake_venom_and_fangs | evolutionary pressures]] caused fangs to move to the front of the jaw, improving prey capture and killing ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Fangs also evolved from smooth teeth, with venom initially flowing down the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Eventually, a groove formed to channel the venom, deepening over time to create a hollow tube that literally injects venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Only about one-seventh of the world's snakes have hollow fangs, though almost all venomous snakes in Australia do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Toxicity and Effects on Humans

Snake venom is lethal to humans because we are closely related to rodents, a common prey for snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Our shared biology, from cell structure to blood clotting and nerve signaling, makes us susceptible to venoms that target conserved molecular pathways across vertebrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

Based on studies using lab mice, one King Cobra bite contains enough venom to kill 13,000 mice, or an estimated four human-sized rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The Inland Taipan, considered the most venomous snake in the world by this measure, can kill half a million mice or over 100 humans with a single bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

[[types_and_effects_of_snake_venom_on_humans | Snake venom]] can kill in four primary ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>:
*   **Neurotoxic**: Damages the nervous system and brain by interfering with neurotransmitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Hemotoxic**: Thins blood, prevents wound healing, and causes internal bleeding by disturbing blood coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Cytotoxic**: Attacks cells, leading to severe blisters, necrosis, and cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Myotoxic**: Destroys muscles and causes paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Most venoms are complex, containing up to 200 compounds and a combination of neurotoxic, hemotoxic, cytotoxic, and myotoxic proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This complexity makes snake bites incredibly difficult to treat, as multiple toxins must be neutralized simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## The [[history_and_development_of_antivenom | History and Development of Antivenom]]

The concept of antivenom emerged from observations of indigenous practices.

### Early Discoveries

In 1870, British military doctor Edward Nicholson observed local snake handlers in Burma deliberately exposing themselves to Cobra bites, seemingly to develop an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. He noted that older handlers were less affected by accidental bites, suggesting a form of acquired immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Twenty years later, French medical researcher Albert Calmette, working in Saigon, wondered if a vaccine for snake bites could be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. He began injecting rabbits with tiny, increasing doses of Cobra venom over eight months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. After this period, the rabbits could tolerate doses 15 times the normal lethal amount, as their immune systems had developed antibodies to neutralize the venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Calmette then took blood from a venom-resistant rabbit, isolated the antibody-containing serum, and injected it into a rabbit that had never been exposed to venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This rabbit survived twice the lethal dose of Cobra venom, demonstrating that immunity could be transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This marked the creation of the first antivenom, or "antivenin" as Calmette called it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Modern Antivenom Production

Today, antivenoms are largely produced using similar methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>:
1.  **Venom Collection**: Venom is collected and frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
2.  **Donor Animal Immunization**: The venom is diluted and injected into a donor animal, typically a horse, due to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The dose is gradually increased over several months until the horse develops immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
3.  **Antibody Isolation**: Blood is drawn from the immunized horse, and only the plasma, containing the antibodies, is isolated; the red blood cells are returned to the horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

These horse antibodies serve as the life-saving antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. They work because horse antibodies are very similar to human antibodies due to shared evolutionary history, allowing them to bind to and neutralize toxic compounds in our bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_innovations_in_antivenom_production | Challenges and Innovations in Antivenom Production]]

Despite its effectiveness, the current method of antivenom production faces challenges:
*   **Dangerous Venom Collection**: Collecting venom is inherently risky for handlers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Donor Animal Involvement**: Many donor animals are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Allergic Reactions**: Some people are highly allergic to antivenom itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. One handler, Zac, experienced a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) requiring adrenaline and further antivenom after a minor scratch from a snake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

Scientists are exploring [[challenges_and_innovations_in_antivenom_production | new possibilities]], such as producing antivenom using genetically modified bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. These bacteria would produce specific antibodies for each toxin in a venom, offering a more targeted and potentially safer approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. However, for now, the traditional method remains the primary way antivenom is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

The dedicated work of individuals like Zac, who acknowledge their role in saving countless lives despite the risks, underpins this vital medical process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

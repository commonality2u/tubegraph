## Discovery and Early Use
In 1928, chemist Thomas Midgley Jr. developed a non-toxic and non-flammable refrigerant called dichlorodifluoromethane, which General Motors named Freon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Midgley demonstrated Freon's safety by inhaling it and blowing out a candle at the American Chemical Society unveiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

In the following decades, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), including Freon, became widely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. They were used as refrigerants in household appliances like fridges, as solvents, and in aerosols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

## Environmental Impacts
CFCs are light and stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. When released into the atmosphere, they ascend into the stratosphere where they can persist for 50 to 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

### Ozone Layer Depletion
In the stratosphere, if a CFC molecule is struck by an ultraviolet (UV) photon of the correct energy, it breaks apart, releasing a chlorine atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. This chlorine atom can then react with ozone, breaking it down into chlorine monoxide and oxygen gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

The result of this process was the formation of a hole in the ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. A depleted ozone layer allows more UV light to penetrate the atmosphere, leading to increased rates of skin cancer and cataracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. The historian John McNeil noted that Midgley "had more impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

### Greenhouse Gas Effect
In addition to ozone depletion, CFCs are potent greenhouse gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Per kilogram, they contribute 10,000 times more warming than carbon dioxide (CO2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

## Mitigation and Recovery
An international agreement known as the Montreal Protocol, which aimed to phase out CFCs, went into effect in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. As a result of these efforts, the ozone layer is now showing signs of recovery, though it will take many more decades for it to fully recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

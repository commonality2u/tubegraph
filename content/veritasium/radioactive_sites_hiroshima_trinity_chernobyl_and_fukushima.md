Radiation is a type of energy, and a Geiger counter measures [[understanding_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]], which has enough energy to rip electrons off atoms [00:00:39]. Radiation exposure is measured in units called Sieverts (Sv) [00:00:48]. Exposure to more than two Sieverts all at once is likely to be fatal [00:00:50]. While we are constantly exposed to low levels of [[understanding_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]], such as from naturally radioactive potassium in bananas (0.1 microSv per banana) [00:00:56], or from [[background_radiation_levels_globally | natural background radiation]] in soil, rocks, air, and space [00:01:31], certain locations on Earth have significantly higher levels due to historical events.

## Hiroshima

In Hiroshima, Japan, the world's first [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | nuclear bomb]] was detonated over a city [00:02:15]. This event occurred approximately 600 meters above the Peace Dome to achieve maximum destructive impact [00:02:12]. Nearly 70 years after the detonation, the level of radiation in Hiroshima is approximately 0.3 microSieverts per hour [00:02:23].

## Trinity Bomb Test Site

The Trinity bomb test site in New Mexico was where the world's first [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | nuclear bomb]] was detonated [00:04:11]. The immense heat from the explosion vaporized the entire area and fused the desert sand into a unique green glass known as trinitite [00:04:19]. Trinitite is unique to this site [00:04:42]. The general radiation level at the Trinity site is about 0.8 microSieverts per hour, with the trinitite itself showing readings of two or three microSieverts per hour [00:04:49]. This site is part of the broader history of the [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Manhattan Project]].

## Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor Number Four

On April 26th, 1986, Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four experienced a meltdown [00:05:40]. The extreme heat generated blew the top off the reactor, spreading radioactive isotopes across the surrounding area and into Europe [00:05:47]. Today, contamination can still be detected [00:06:01].

The radiation level near the reactor is around 5 microSieverts per hour [00:06:04]. To reduce the radiation, a couple of meters of topsoil were removed from the area and dumped elsewhere [00:06:23].

A highly radioactive location within the Chernobyl zone is the basement of the hospital in Pripyat, where the clothing of firemen who fought the Chernobyl reactor fires was dumped [00:07:54]. Readings just outside the basement door reached 500 microSieverts per hour, and inside, they were as high as 1,500 microSieverts per hour [00:08:36]. This basement is considered one of the most radioactive places on Earth [00:08:55]. Staying there for one hour would result in a dose of 2,000 microSieverts, equivalent to a year's worth of [[background_radiation_levels_globally | natural background radiation]] [00:09:00].

## Fukushima Exclusion Zone

In 2011, a nuclear power disaster occurred at Fukushima [00:09:26]. While the release of radioactive material was less than Chernobyl's, only about 10% [00:07:29], the radioactivity is "much fresher" as it's only been three years since the accident [00:07:33]. As one approaches the Fukushima exclusion zone, Geiger counter levels increase [00:06:38]. Similar to Chernobyl, the Japanese are collecting meters of topsoil and placing it in black bags along the road to reduce contamination [00:06:46]. Readings in the Fukushima exclusion zone have been around 5 to 10 microSieverts per hour [00:07:42].

It is estimated that people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 microSieverts over their lifetime due to the disaster [00:09:21]. This highlights the [[ethical_implications_and_aftermath_of_nuclear_weapons | ethical implications and aftermath of nuclear weapons]] and nuclear accidents.

## Comparative Radiation Doses

To put these levels into perspective:
*   A dental x-ray delivers a similar dose to staying near the Chernobyl reactor for one hour (5 microSieverts) [00:06:09].
*   A CT scan exposes a patient to about 7,000 microSieverts, which is three years' worth of [[background_radiation_levels_globally | natural background radiation]] [00:09:13].
*   [[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations | Radiation workers]] are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microSieverts per year [00:09:30].
*   An [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | astronaut]] on the space station for six months receives about 80,000 microSieverts of radiation [00:09:41].
*   However, the highest levels of [[understanding_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]] are typically received by smokers' lungs, which average 160,000 microSieverts per year due to radioactive polonium and lead in tobacco [00:09:58]. This demonstrates a significant [[health_impacts_of_radiation_exposure | health impacts of radiation exposure]] from everyday habits.

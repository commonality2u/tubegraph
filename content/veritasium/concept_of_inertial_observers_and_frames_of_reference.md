In [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | general relativity]], gravity is presented not as a force or gravitational field, but as an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This perspective fundamentally redefines the concept of acceleration and what constitutes an inertial observer.

## Defining an Inertial Observer

According to Albert Einstein, an inertial observer is akin to someone who is weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This idea originated from his "happiest thought": imagining a man falling off a roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While falling, the man would feel weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, and any objects he dropped would remain stationary relative to him or move in uniform motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This scenario is equivalent to being in deep space, away from large masses, with a spaceship at rest or coasting at a constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. In such a state, one feels no weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, and objects remain stationary or move in straight lines at constant velocity after a push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]>.

An inertial observer is characterized by:
*   Not accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Not being in a gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   All laws of physics applying in their reference frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, meaning no experiment can distinguish their inertial reference frame from any other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Einstein's Equivalence Principle

The [[Einsteins equivalence principle and its implications | Equivalence Principle]] states that the sensation of weightlessness (like the man falling from a roof or the "Rocket Man" in deep space) means one is in an inertial frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This implies that the man falling from the roof is *not* in a gravitational field and is *not* accelerating; he is an inertial observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

This perspective is counter-intuitive in Newtonian physics, where the falling man is clearly accelerating due to Earth's gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, [[Einsteins equivalence principle and its implications | Einstein's Equivalence Principle]] shifts the focus to the observer's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. If an observer feels weightless, they are in an inertial frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. For example, Rocket Man, even when his path appears curved to an external observer as he approaches a planet, remains oblivious inside his rocket, feeling no force or acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]>. An onboard accelerometer would register no change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]>. He continues on his inertial path through spacetime until he crashes into the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]>.

## Curved Spacetime and Geodesics

The appearance of a curved path for an inertial observer (like Rocket Man) is explained by [[Applications of NonEuclidean Geometry in General Relativity | curved spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]>. An inertial observer always moves in a straight line *through spacetime* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]>. However, spacetime around massive objects like planets is curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]>, making the straight line path appear curved to a distant observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]>.

These "straightest paths" over curved surfaces are called **geodesics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]>. Inertial observers follow these geodesics through [[Applications of NonEuclidean Geometry in General Relativity | curved spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]>. An analogy is two people walking due North from the equator: they appear to be pushed together, but they are simply following straight paths (geodesics) on a curved surface (Earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]>.

Astronauts on the space station are weightless, meaning they are inertial observers traveling on a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]>. The Earth curves spacetime around it, which is why their straight line path appears as a helix, only looking like a circular orbit if the time dimension is ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]>.

## Acceleration in General Relativity

In [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | general relativity]], the perception of "being at rest" on Earth's surface is equivalent to accelerating in a rocket ship in deep space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]>. If you feel weight (i.e., not weightless), you are not an inertial observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]>.

While Newtonian physics describes the normal force from the floor balancing the gravitational force, implying no acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]>, [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | general relativity]] states that there is no gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]>. You have no weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]>. Therefore, the only force acting on you is the normal force pushing you up, meaning you *are* accelerating upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]>.

> In [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | curved spacetime]], you need to accelerate just to stand still. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>

This acceleration is a deviation from a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]>. The floor prevents you from following a straight line path through spacetime, applying an upward force that causes you to accelerate upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]>. This is possible even if your spatial coordinates are not changing, due to the curvature of spacetime and your velocity through time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]>.

### Why All Objects Fall at the Same Rate

A classical mystery in Newtonian physics is why all objects fall at the same rate. The explanation relied on the seemingly coincidental numerical identity of gravitational mass (which experiences a gravitational field) and inertial mass (resistance to acceleration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]>.

In [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | general relativity]], there is no mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]>. All objects appear to fall the same way because they are *not accelerating* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]>. They are simply following straight line paths (geodesics) through spacetime until something stops them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]>. Similarly, objects in a rocket ship appear to accelerate at the same rate because they are not accelerating; it's the floor of the rocket accelerating into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]>.

## Experimental Validation and Predictions

The concepts of inertial observers and [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | general theory of relativity and gravity]] were validated through key [[Astronomical observations supporting general relativity | astronomical observations supporting general relativity]].

### Bending of Light

Einstein predicted that if an accelerating frame of reference bends light, then light must also bend when it passes a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]>. This was famously tested during a total solar eclipse in 1919 by Arthur Eddington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]>. His observations of stars near the sun showed their positions were deflected by the precise amount predicted by [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]>, a result twice the deflection calculated by some using a strictly Newtonian model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]>.

### Accelerating Charges

A proposed experiment to further test the nature of gravity involves comparing the behavior of a stationary charge in a gravitational field to a free-falling one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]>.

*   **Newtonian Picture:** A stationary charge should not radiate electromagnetic radiation, while a free-falling one (accelerating) should radiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]>.
*   **General Relativity Picture:** A free-falling charge is non-accelerating (following a geodesic), so it should *not* radiate. A stationary charge is accelerating (deviating from a geodesic), so it *should* give off electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]>.

Logistical challenges have prevented this experiment from being carried out, but the predicted outcome reveals one's underlying belief about the nature of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]>.

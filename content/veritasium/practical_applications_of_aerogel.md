Aerogel, known as the world's lightest and least dense solid, is composed of 99.8% air and has a mass only a few times that of the same volume of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Some [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogels]] are so light that if all the air were removed, they would be less dense than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Its unique structure, featuring a nanoporous solid skeleton, gives it remarkable [[properties_of_aerogel | properties]] that lead to various practical [[applications_of_aerogel_in_waterproofing_and_insulation | applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Thermal Insulation

One of the primary [[applications_of_aerogel_in_waterproofing_and_insulation | applications]] of aerogel is its exceptional [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal insulation capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Demonstration of Insulating Power
An experiment comparing a glass petri dish with an aerogel-topped setup demonstrated its insulating power using a Bunsen burner and thermal camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Glass Petri Dish**: After just one minute, the glass became very hot, and a chocolate bunny placed on it began to melt and smoke, eventually leading to a complete "phase change" and the petri dish cracking due to thermal expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Aerogel Setup**: Even after three minutes of direct flame exposure, there was no sign of melted chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The flame underneath the aerogel reached 600 degrees Celsius (1250 Fahrenheit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. While the bunny eventually softened and melted from convective heat wrapping around the aerogel, the aerogel itself remained cool enough to touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### How it Works (Knudsen Effect)
Despite being mostly air, aerogel is a better insulator than air because its nanoscale pores are smaller than the average distance air molecules travel before colliding (their mean free path) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This phenomenon, known as the Knudsen effect, makes it difficult for hot, fast-moving air molecules to diffuse through the aerogel and transfer heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Space Exploration
NASA has extensively used [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | aerogel insulation]] on Mars rovers such as Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity, and Curiosity. It is planned for future Mars missions to protect sensitive electronics from the extreme cold during Martian nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Particle Capture

Beyond insulation, NASA has employed aerogel for more unique [[applications_of_aerogel_in_waterproofing_and_insulation | uses]], such as capturing comet dust during the Stardust mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. When particles traveling at approximately six kilometers per second hit the low-density, porous aerogel, they enter the material, break apart its network, lose energy, and eventually come to a stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This method is effective for capturing particles intact, unlike solid surfaces which would cause them to vaporize on impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Future Applications and Challenges

While currently not common in everyday life, there are [[future_uses_of_aerogel_in_clothing_and_space_technology | expectations for wider adoption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Building Insulation**: Its extreme thermal efficiency could allow for significantly thinner insulation layers in buildings, for example, six inches of aerogel instead of ten feet of fiberglass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This could be particularly beneficial in extreme environments like Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Durability and Cost**: Scientists are actively working on [[future_developments_and_challenges_for_aerogel | reducing costs and increasing durability]] to make aerogel more accessible for widespread [[applications_of_aerogel_in_waterproofing_and_insulation | applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Waterproofing**: Original silica aerogel is hydrophilic and can be ruined by water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, methods to make it waterproof are being developed, opening up new possibilities for its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

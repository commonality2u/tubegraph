Dark matter is hypothesized to constitute approximately 85% of all matter in existence, potentially forming a "shadow universe" five times more massive than everything visible to us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The existence of dark matter is proposed to explain various astronomical observations that cannot be accounted for by ordinary, visible matter alone.

## Early Origins of the Hypothesis

The concept of unseen matter was first introduced in 1933 by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. While studying the Coma cluster, a collection of over a thousand gravitationally bound galaxies, Zwicky observed that these galaxies were orbiting their collective center of mass at speeds much faster than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. He concluded that there must be significantly more mass in the cluster than what could be seen, pulling everything inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. To explain this, Zwicky proposed the existence of "dunkle materie" (dark matter), from which the modern term originates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. His idea, however, was not widely accepted at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Evidence from Galactic Rotation Curves

Around 40 years after Zwicky's initial proposal, more evidence for dark matter emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Vera Rubin and Kent Ford observed the motion of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Standard gravitational theories predicted that stars further from the galactic center would orbit slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, Rubin and Ford found that the rotational velocity of stars remained almost constant with increasing distance from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Without additional unseen mass, these outer stars should have been flung into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

This consistent rotational velocity was also observed in other galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Using radio telescopes, Albert Bosma and others measured hydrogen gas even further out from galactic centers and found the rotational velocity still remained constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The simplest explanation for these observations is the presence of invisible matter, or dark matter, holding galaxies together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. By analyzing these rotation speeds, scientists estimate that approximately 85% of a galaxy's mass is composed of dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Alternative Theories vs. Dark Matter

While the existence of dark matter is the leading explanation, some propose [[alternative_theories_to_dark_matter | modifying our theory of gravity]] instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This approach suggests that the unusual centripetal acceleration seen in galactic outskirts is not due to an additional force from dark matter, but rather a fundamental limit to how low acceleration can go (e.g., Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or MOND) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. However, the scientific consensus strongly favors the idea of dark matter as a physical substance, implying the existence of unseen particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Further Evidence

### The Bullet Cluster

The Bullet Cluster provides compelling evidence for dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This is a site where two galaxy clusters have collided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. During the collision, most of the ordinary mass, which is primarily interstellar gas, interacted, heated up, and slowed down, accumulating in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. However, by using gravitational lensing – the way gravity bends light – scientists measured where most of the mass in the Bullet Cluster is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The results showed that the majority of the mass is not in the middle where the gas is, but rather on either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This suggests that while the ordinary matter (gas) got stuck, the dark matter passed right through the collision without interacting, creating gravitational lensing where visible matter is sparse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### [[cosmic_background_radiation_and_dark_matter | Cosmic Background Radiation and Dark Matter]]

Additional strong evidence for dark matter comes from the [[cosmic_background_radiation_and_dark_matter | cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), the oldest light in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The CMB, which formed 380,000 years after the Big Bang, shows tiny temperature differences across the early universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. These temperature fluctuations can be analyzed by counting "blobs" of different sizes and plotting them as a graph with peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The heights of these peaks are directly influenced by the amount of dark matter present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. To match the observed CMB measurements, the universe requires approximately five times as much dark matter as ordinary matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This estimation aligns consistently with the amounts of dark matter inferred from the motion of stars in galaxies and galaxies in clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Nature of Dark Matter and Ongoing Research

The dark matter hypothesis offers a coherent theoretical framework that explains a wide array of different astrophysical observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. It postulates the existence of a type of particle that interacts primarily through gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. While the exact nature of this particle remains unknown, scientists have proposed various candidates, such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. WIMPs are expected to be roughly the mass of a proton but interact with ordinary matter extremely weakly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

Currently, numerous [[dark_matter_detection_experiments | dark matter detection experiments]] are underway globally, attempting to directly detect these elusive particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. One notable experiment is DAMA/LIBRA, located under a mountain in the Italian Alps, which has been collecting data for about 20 years and shows a peculiar annual signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This signal peaks in June and reaches a minimum in November, which some scientists suggest could be the first direct evidence of dark matter due to Earth's varying speed through the galactic dark matter halo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

However, other similar experiments have not detected this signal, leading to uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. To resolve this, an almost identical experiment is being built in a gold mine near Melbourne, Australia, in the Southern Hemisphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Because the seasons are reversed there while the Earth's motion through dark matter remains the same, a confirmation of the annual signal would provide strong evidence for dark matter's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The search for [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter | dark matter interaction with ordinary matter]] is paramount for understanding this mysterious component of our universe.

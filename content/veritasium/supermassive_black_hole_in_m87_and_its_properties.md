The supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87 was the subject of the [[firstever_black_hole_image_by_event_horizon_telescope | first-ever image of a black hole]], released by the [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] (EHT) collaboration on April 10, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Imaging the Black Hole

The image shows [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole | plasma orbiting]] the supermassive black hole in M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The bright region indicates where plasma is moving towards observers, appearing brighter due to [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole | relativistic beaming]] as it travels near the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Conversely, plasma moving away appears dimmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

From the images, scientists determined that the plasma orbits clockwise, completing one orbit in approximately two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Observation Wavelength

The black hole was observed using electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters, specifically radio waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This part of the spectrum was chosen because it can reveal features close to the event horizon and pass through the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] and interstellar dust to reach Earth's telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Activity and Jets

The supermassive black hole in M87 is highly active, continuously consuming matter from its glowing hot [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It also features narrow, collimated jets extending above and below it, thought to be generated by incredibly strong magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These jets stretch at least 5,000 light-years, with one appearing to point almost directly towards Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole | Relativistic beaming]] explains why the jet coming towards us is visible in Hubble Space Telescope images, while the receding jet is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Relativistic Effects and Appearance

The [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | warping of space-time]] around the black hole allows light to be seen even from parts of the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] located behind the black hole, appearing "lensed" above and below the shadow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Image Clarity and Apparent Size

The image of the black hole appears fuzzy due to its extremely tiny apparent size from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. While the black hole itself is supermassive, with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, and its shadow is nearly the size of our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, its immense distance of 53.5 million light-years means its apparent size on the sky is only about 40 micro arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

> To put 40 micro arcseconds into perspective:
> 1.  Divide the whole sky into 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
> 2.  Divide a degree into 60 arcminutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
> 3.  Divide an arcminute into 60 arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
> 4.  Divide an arcsecond into 100, then into 100 again, and into 100 once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
> 5.  This final division represents the size of the black hole shadow, approximately 40 micro arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

This tiny angular size pushes the very limits of what is technologically capable of being seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Observational Challenges and Collaboration

To achieve the necessary resolution, dictated by the basic law of physics known as the [[technical_challenges_and_global_collaboration_in_observing_black_holes | diffraction limit]], a telescope the size of the Earth would be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Since this is impractical, scientists used eight telescopes spread across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. These telescopes simultaneously observed M87, and the Earth's rotation helped to simulate the effect of an Earth-sized telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Comparison with Sagittarius A*

The EHT also observed Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. While Sgr A* is much closer at around 26,000 light-years away, it is also significantly smaller, with a mass of only four million times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Sgr A* is less active, only periodically accreting matter, and exhibits much greater variation over time, with matter orbiting every four to thirty minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. These factors likely contribute to why an image of Sgr A* has not yet been released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Significance of the Discovery

The striking image of the black hole in M87 confirms beyond a doubt that [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] do exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This achievement provides spectacular support for the general theory of relativity, published over a hundred years ago, testing its limits in the strongest gravitational fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The pursuit of this seemingly impossible goal by 200 scientists highlights a remarkable achievement in modern science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

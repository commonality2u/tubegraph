Flames exhibit distinct behaviors depending on the gravitational acceleration present in an environment. This is due to how gravity influences the movement of hot gases and the supply of oxygen to a combustion reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51">[03:51]</a>. [[conducting_experiments_in_zero_gravity | Experiments conducted in zero-g environments]], such as aboard a Zero-G plane, provide insights into these phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36">[03:36]</a>.

## Flame Behavior in Normal Gravity (1g)

In Earth's normal gravity, flames have a distinctive, teardrop or elongated shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51">[03:51]</a>. This shape is a direct result of gravity:
*   **Buoyant Force**: The products of combustion are hotter, move faster, and take up more space than the cooler air surrounding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57">[03:57]</a>. This creates a buoyant force that is greater than their weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04">[04:04]</a>.
*   **Hot Air Rising**: Consequently, the hot air rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07">[04:07]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Supply**: This rising hot air helps to pull fresh oxygen from around the flame, sustaining the combustion reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09">[04:09]</a>.

## Flame Behavior in Hyper-G

In a hyper-g environment (e.g., 1.8 times body weight), the effect of gravity is magnified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22">[04:22]</a>.
*   **Increased Buoyancy**: This amplifies the difference between the weight of the hot air and the cooler air around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27">[04:27]</a>.
*   **Faster Rising Hot Air**: As a result, the hot air rises faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32">[04:32]</a>.
*   **Longer Flame**: This leads to a longer, more stretched flame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35">[04:35]</a>.

## Flame Behavior in Zero-G

In a zero-g environment, where there is no weight and no buoyant force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13">[05:13]</a>, flames behave very differently:
*   **No Rising Hot Air**: The hot air, despite being less dense, does not rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10">[05:10]</a>.
*   **Reduced Buoyant Force**: There is significantly less buoyant force to carry away combustion products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47">[04:47]</a>.
*   **Incomplete Combustion**: This often leads to less efficient combustion and the production of a lot of smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50">[04:50]</a>.
*   **Spherical Shape (Ideal)**: Without the influence of buoyancy, flames would ideally form a sphere, as seen on the International Space Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24">[05:24]</a>.
*   **Influence of Fuel Flow**: If there is a continuous flow of fuel from the source (e.g., a lighter), the flame may not be perfectly spherical but will still appear very strange compared to Earth-bound flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Access Issues**: It becomes more challenging for oxygen to access the fuel because combustion products tend to accumulate around the flame, hindering the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>.

Observing a flame can serve as a reliable method for determining the gravitational acceleration in a given location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36">[05:36]</a>. The unique behaviors of flames in zero gravity challenge human intuition, which is primarily developed through experiences in Earth's gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04">[07:04]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[conducting_experiments_in_zero_gravity | zero-g research]] to understand physical phenomena outside of Earth's gravitational influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20">[07:20]</a>.

Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, has undergone a significant transformation from a limited craft to a sophisticated discipline inspiring modern engineering solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Early Origins and Limited Designs

The practice of origami, which literally means "folding paper," dates back at least 400 years in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. For centuries, the number of documented designs was quite restricted, with only a handful of patterns, perhaps 100 to 200 in total, known in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The 20th Century Renaissance

The vast expansion of origami designs, now numbering in the tens of thousands, largely occurred during the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This renaissance was significantly influenced by a few Japanese origami masters, with Akira Yoshizawa being the most successful among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Yoshizawa created thousands of new designs and published numerous books detailing his work, which sparked a worldwide surge in origami creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. His influence helped shift origami from a purely aesthetic pursuit to one recognized for its potential in [[engineering_applications_of_origami | engineering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

An example of the complexity and dedication involved in modern origami design is a cactus model, complete with spines and a pot, folded from a single meter-square sheet of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This particular design took approximately seven years to complete from start to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Modern Design Methods and Mathematical Principles

The utility of origami in [[engineering_applications_of_origami | engineering]] stems from its ability to transform a flat sheet into various shapes with minimal processing, often increasing rigidity through the act of folding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This shift from aesthetic creation to functional design heavily relies on [[mathematical_principles_in_origami | mathematical methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### The Crease Pattern and Circle Packing Method

A key development in origami design is the concept of a "crease pattern," which serves as a detailed plan for folding a specific shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. For designs that can be represented as "stick figures" (e.g., animals with distinct limbs), the "circle packing method" is commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

This method involves:
*   Representing each feature of the desired object (e.g., scorpion's tail, legs, claws) as an abstract circular region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   Arranging these circles within a square sheet of paper, similar to packing balls into a box, ensuring they all fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   The arrangement of these circles forms the "skeleton" of the crease pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Geometrical rules are then applied to construct the actual crease lines:
    *   Drawing a line between the center of every pair of circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
    *   Adding "ridge folds" (halfway between two lines meeting in a V-shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
    *   Following step-by-step geometric patterns to add more lines until the complete pattern is constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
Once completed, the circles, which served as scaffolding, are removed, leaving the precise fold lines required to create the desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This systematic process revolutionized origami design by ensuring the fold pattern precisely yielded the intended shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Origamizer Algorithm for Complex Surfaces

While the circle packing method is effective for stick-figure-like objects, other algorithms are needed for more complex, surface-based shapes (e.g., spheres, blobs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Approximately ten years ago, Japanese mathematician Tomohiro Tachi developed an algorithm called "Origamizer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This algorithm can take any triangulated surface as a mathematical description and generate the precise folding pattern required to achieve that three-dimensional shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

The evolution of origami design, from ancient, limited patterns to modern, mathematically driven algorithms like circle packing and Origamizer, has transformed it into a powerful tool for [[engineering_applications_of_origami | engineers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. These principles enable the transformation of flat sheets into virtually any shape, the reduction of dimensions for compact storage, increased rigidity through folding, and the creation of specific, functional motions in devices ranging from [[origami_in_medical_and_technological_devices | medical instruments]] to [[origamis_role_in_space_and_aerodynamic_solutions | aerospace components]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This continuous development leverages centuries of folding experimentation, underpinned by rigorous [[mathematical_principles_in_origami | mathematical modeling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

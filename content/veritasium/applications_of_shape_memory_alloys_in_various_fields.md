[[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Shape memory alloys]] (SMAs) possess unique properties, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from medical devices to aerospace engineering. These properties include the ability to adjust their atomic arrangement to return to a predefined shape, convert between mechanical and thermal energy, and stretch significantly more than ordinary metals while still springing back to their original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Key Properties of [[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Shape Memory Alloys]]

### Shape Memory Effect
The shape memory effect is the ability of an alloy to return to a pre-set shape after being deformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This occurs due to solid-state phase changes:
*   **Austenite Phase:** At higher temperatures, the atoms are arranged in a cubic lattice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This is where the "parent" memory shape is set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Martensite Phase:** Upon cooling, the atoms transition into a messier, lower-symmetry arrangement called twinned martensite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. In this phase, stress can be applied to deform the material, causing it to change into a "detwinned" form of martensite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Shape Recovery:** When heated back up, the material reverts from martensite to austenite, causing the atoms to return to their original locations and thus restoring the material's original shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
The temperature at which this transition occurs can be tuned between -150 and 350 degrees Celsius by altering the ratio of elements and applying different heat treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Superelasticity (Pseudo Elasticity)
[[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Shape memory alloys]] can stretch up to 8% of their length and still return to their original size, a property known as superelasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This occurs when the material is in the austenite phase and its transition temperature is below room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Applying stress induces a phase change from austenite to detwinned martensite, allowing significant deformation. When the stress is removed, the atoms spring back to the austenite phase, restoring the material's original configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This stress-induced phase change can be felt as a "crunchy" sensation and heard as a "pinging" sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### Elastocalorics
The phase transitions in [[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | shape memory alloys]] are accompanied by energy changes. When transforming from a higher symmetry (austenite) to a lower symmetry (martensite) phase, it is exothermic (releases heat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Conversely, when the stress is removed and the material returns to austenite, it's endothermic (absorbs heat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This property is being applied in the field of elastocalorics for heat pumping applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. The material's ability to dissipate energy also means it can act as a damper, potentially forming a complete suspension system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

## Applications

### Medical Devices
[[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Shape memory alloys]], such as Nitinol (a nickel-titanium alloy, discovered in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>), are used in [[origami_in_medical_and_technological_devices | medical devices]] due to their ability to return to a pre-defined shape. A common example is in stents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Stents can be slightly cooled into their martensite phase, crushed, or elongated to become very thin. They are then inserted via a catheter to the deployment site in the body. Upon deployment, typically by natural body heat or targeted heating, the stent expands back to its original shape, opening an artery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Actuators
[[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Shape memory alloys]] can generate significant forces when heated, making them suitable for use as actuators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. For instance, a nitinol wire heated by an electrical current can contract with considerable force, capable of lifting heavy objects or even fracturing a rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Aerospace Engineering
[[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Shape memory alloys]] are being investigated for [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | aerospace engineering]] applications, particularly for active flow control on aircraft wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Vortex Generators:** Small fins on aircraft wings, called vortex generators, are crucial for takeoff and landing to manage airflow and prevent stalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. During cruise, however, these generate drag. SMAs can be designed to autonomously stow these generators when the plane reaches higher altitudes and colder temperatures, then deploy them again during descent as temperatures rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Aircraft Flaps:** This principle has been extended to control the main flaps on an aircraft. By using two tubes of nitinol with controlled heating and cooling, hydraulic actuators can be replaced, simplifying the wing box mechanism and enabling movements like a 60-degree flap angle down and 30-degree flap angle up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### Tire Technology
[[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Shape memory alloys]] are revolutionizing tire design, especially for space exploration and terrestrial vehicles.
*   **NASA Rover Wheels:** Traditional rubber pneumatic tires are unsuitable for lunar or Martian environments due to extreme temperature fluctuations (250°F to -250°F on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>) and lack of atmospheric pressure, which can cause them to become brittle or explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Existing aluminum wheels, like those on the Curiosity rover, are prone to damage from aggressive terrain, leading to holes and cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   NASA's solution involves weaving nitinol springs into a mesh to create tires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. These tires are strong enough to support the weight of a vehicle but also incredibly flexible, deforming up to 8% without permanent damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. This durability is essential for long space missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
    *   Unlike previous steel mesh wheels that deformed permanently over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, SMA tires can withstand continuous stress. The design also allows for load transfer 360 degrees around the tire, significantly increasing load-carrying capacity without adding mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Terrestrial Applications:** This technology is being adapted for earth-bound vehicles, including bicycles and Jeeps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
    *   **Airless Bicycle Tires:** A bicycle tire made with nitinol springs inside a polymer does not require air pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Its structure and shock absorption are provided by the metal springs, making it puncture-proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. These tires have been demonstrated to maintain performance even after being driven over a bed of nails and shot with a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   **Aircraft and Automobile Tires:** Airless SMA tires eliminate the need for high pressurization (300-400 psi in aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>), reducing the risk of explosions and constant maintenance for air pressure checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. They also improve fuel economy by preventing under-inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

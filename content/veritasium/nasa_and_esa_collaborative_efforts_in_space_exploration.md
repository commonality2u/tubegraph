NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are undertaking collaborative efforts in space exploration, particularly concerning the Jupiter system and its icy moons. These efforts involve coordinated missions to maximize scientific understanding.

## Coordinated Missions to Jupiter's Icy Moons

The Europa Clipper, a mission by NASA, is slated to launch in October 2024 to hunt for signs of alien life on Jupiter's moon Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This mission will not be studying Jupiter's moons in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

Concurrently, the European Space Agency's (ESA) JUICE mission (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is already en route to Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The JUICE mission is expected to arrive in the Jupiter system approximately 15 months after the Europa Clipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Europa Clipper (NASA)
The Europa Clipper's primary objective is to orbit Jupiter from afar and perform 49 close flybys of Europa over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This approach allows it to map almost the entire surface of Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> and collect data while avoiding the intense radiation belts surrounding Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The mission will utilize instruments such as an infrared spectrometer to identify chemical fingerprints and map salts and organics, an ultraviolet spectrograph to search for and potentially fly through plumes, and wide and narrow-angle cameras for high-resolution imaging of the moon's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### JUICE Mission (ESA)
While JUICE will perform a few flybys of Europa, its ultimate goal is to settle into a tight orbit around Ganymede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

## Benefits of Dual Missions

The presence of both the Europa Clipper and JUICE missions in the Jupiter system at roughly the same time offers significant advantages for scientific discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Scientists from both agencies engage in informal conversations to maximize the scientific output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

For instance, if the Europa Clipper, positioned outside Ganymede's magnetosphere, detects a significant burst originating from Jupiter, the JUICE mission, while in orbit around Ganymede, could corroborate this event by observing corresponding magnetic signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This synchronized data collection ensures that "the sum of the whole is even bigger than its parts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

The collaboration represents an example of setting ambitious goals and working together to achieve them, making a significant impact on global scientific exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

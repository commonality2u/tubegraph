For many years, directly seeing atoms was considered impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Atoms are incredibly small, approximately 0.1 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Visible light, with wavelengths between 380 and 750 nanometers, is over 3,000 times larger than an atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. When the wavelength of light is much larger than the object being observed, the light simply diffracts or bends around it, making it invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Electron Microscopy and the Challenge of Resolution

To observe atoms, a medium with a significantly smaller wavelength is required, and electrons proved to be the ideal candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This concept aligns with the [[principles_of_electron_microscopy_and_waveparticle_duality | principles of electron microscopy and wave-particle duality]], which stem from Louis de Broglie's 1924 discovery that all matter exhibits wavelike properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Electrons accelerated to relativistic speeds (e.g., 80% the speed of light) can have wavelengths as small as 2 to 3 picometers, which is over 100,000 times smaller than visible light, theoretically offering a proportional increase in resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The [[history_and_development_of_electron_microscopes | first working electron microscope]], a transmission electron microscope (TEM), was built in 1931 by Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll, utilizing electromagnetic lenses to focus electron beams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Early TEMs, made of brass and roughly bolted together, barely magnified at all, and initially weren't even better than optical microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. However, through continuous experimentation and the addition of more lenses, Ruska achieved magnifications exceeding 10,000 times by the mid-1930s, allowing detailed views of insects, bacteria, and viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### The Problem of Spherical Aberration

Despite these advancements, a significant roadblock emerged with the unavoidable flaw in electromagnetic lenses known as [[spherical_aberration_and_its_impact_on_resolution | spherical aberration and its impact on resolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Otto Scherzer, a German physicist, published a paper in 1936 claiming that this aberration would prevent further progress on the TEM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Spherical aberration causes electrons at the edges of the beam to over-deflect and focus before those in the middle, spreading the focus across the optical axis instead of to a single point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This blurs the image, especially at higher magnifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Unlike optical lenses, which can use diverging lenses to correct spherical aberration, magnetic lenses are inherently converging and cannot diverge an electron beam, making correction physically impossible with radially symmetric designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This limitation significantly slowed the microscope's resolution advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

In 1955, the field ion microscope (FIM) was developed and took the first generally accepted images of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, the FIM was limited to imaging only the tip of a needle and produced unimpressive images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Later, in 1970, Albert Crewe produced the first image of single atoms using a scanning TEM (STEM), which utilized a brighter, more directed electron source and scanned the sample bit by bit, similar to a cathode ray tube TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Despite these efforts, Scherzer's spherical aberration problem persisted, setting a hard limit on how small scientists could see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Probe microscopes, which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, could image atoms by "feeling" the surface, but they did not use lenses and thus weren't limited by spherical aberration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## The Breakthrough of Aberration Correction

The breakthrough in aberration correction for electron microscopes came from three scientists: Knut Urban, Max Haider, and Harold Rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Their innovative idea was to purposefully break the radial symmetry of the lens using a "nest of electromagnets" with multiple coils and bumpy magnetic fields (hexapole, octopole, and decapole magnets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This asymmetric lens would distort the electron beam, twisting and squeezing it into a triangular saddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. The key insight was that this distortion would create a small, localized area with a slight concave bow, effectively producing a small divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. By passing the beam through a second, opposing hexapole, they could unbend the image back into a circular shape, with the remnants of that tiny divergence in its center, which would counteract the spherical aberration of the original lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

After years of skepticism and funding challenges, their persistence paid off. In July 1997, just before their funding ran out, their new lens design was ready for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. After an initial failure and a 24-hour stabilization period for the magnets, the picture miraculously stabilized, and suddenly, there was no aberration, only clear images of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. They reduced the TEM's resolution to an astonishing 0.13 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

Shortly after, Orndrej Krivanek independently achieved the same for the scanning TEM (STEM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. In 2020, Urban, Haider, Rose, and Krivanek were awarded the prestigious Kavli Prize in Nanoscience for their monumental achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

## Impact on Material Science

Aberration correction has been a "game changer" for the field of [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | material science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. If researchers want to see atoms, measure atomic distances, or identify atom types, aberration correction is indispensable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. In [[applications_of_standards_in_industrial_materials | materials engineering]], chemical engineering, and general material science research, understanding what is happening at the atomic level is crucial for relating material properties to their structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Without the ability to see the atomic structure, only half of the necessary information is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. This is why virtually every university today requires an aberration-corrected electron microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

Most plane doors are not locked with keys, sensors, or passcodes, meaning they can be pulled by anyone if they wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, despite 40 million flights annually, these doors are virtually never opened during flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The primary reason for this security lies in the [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | physics]] of high-altitude flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Why Planes Fly So High

Planes typically fly at altitudes ranging from 30,000 to 43,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While some benefits include a smoother ride by avoiding much of the troposphere where most weather occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, the main reason for flying at high altitudes is economic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   **Reduced Air Density** At 33,000 feet (10 km), air density is only one-third of what it is at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This means the plane encounters fewer air molecules, allowing it to fly approximately 73% faster for the same thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This results in faster travel times and less fuel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Engine Efficiency** Jet engines operate more efficiently in colder air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. At cruising altitudes, temperatures are around -50 degrees Celsius, significantly colder than the average +15 degrees Celsius on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Jet Stream Tailwinds** Flying high also allows planes to take advantage of jet stream tailwinds, further reducing fuel burn and costs for airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

While climbing consumes more fuel (around 80 kilos per minute) compared to cruising (40 kilos per minute) or descent (10 kilos per minute), the overall efficiency gains at altitude are substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Challenge of High Altitude: Unbreathable Air

The primary problem with flying at high altitudes is the unbreathable air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Low Air Pressure** Air pressure decreases with altitude, falling faster than density because it depends on the weight of all air above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. At 10 km, air pressure is only one-quarter of sea level pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Oxygen Partial Pressure** Although the air still contains 21% oxygen, the partial pressure of oxygen (pressure exerted solely by oxygen molecules) at 10 km is about 5.5 kilopascals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Humans require at least 16 kilopascals of oxygen partial pressure to function normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Exposure to such low pressure would render a person unconscious in about three minutes, even at heights lower than planes fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Cabin Pressurization and Door Design

To ensure breathable air, all cabins of airplanes cruising at high altitude must be pressurized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. A small amount of air is continuously brought into the cabin from the compression stage of the jet engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This process slightly reduces engine efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

*   **Evolution of Door Design** Before pressurization, planes flew lower (up to 10,000 feet or 3 km) where oxygen partial pressure was just at the human limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Doors opened outward, and their seals were not a major concern due to equal pressure on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **The Plug Door** With pressurized cabins, all doors were redesigned into a "plug" shape, wider on the inside than the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This design means the higher pressure inside the cabin pushes the door into its frame, creating an airtight seal and preventing it from being opened during flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Force Required to Open** The pressure difference is so great that no one is strong enough to pull the door inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Even modern doors that appear to open outward are cleverly designed to function like plugs, requiring an inward movement to disengage from the frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This inward movement is impossible at altitude, requiring a force equivalent to lifting 9,000 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Cabin Pressure Levels and Consequences

Airplane cabins are not fully pressurized to sea level pressure (101.3 kilopascals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. At cruising altitude, cabin pressure drops to around 77 kilopascals, ensuring the partial pressure of oxygen is at least 16 kilopascalsâ€”the minimum for passengers to feel normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This lower pressure explains why a bag of chips inflates on a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> and can also lead to bodily gas expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

The International Space Station, in contrast, is pressurized to full sea level pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. However, planes experience a pressure difference every time they climb and descend, causing the fuselage to stretch and relax with each flight cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Aloha Airlines Flight 243 Incident

The choice to partially pressurize cabins is a safety measure to minimize stress on the aircraft fuselage and extend its lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This was tragically demonstrated in 1988 when Aloha Airlines Flight 243, with nearly 90,000 flight cycles (far more than it was designed for), experienced explosive decompression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. A small crack widened at 24,000 feet, causing a large section of the roof to tear off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The incident highlighted the dangers of metal fatigue from repeated pressurization cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Rare Incidents of Door Opening

Despite the mechanics, a rare incident occurred in May 2023 when a passenger managed to open an Airbus emergency exit door in flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This was only possible because the plane was on its final approach, very close to the ground, where the pressure differential was minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Overall Safety

The robust design of plane doors, combined with the [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | principles]] of cabin pressurization, makes it virtually impossible to open them during high-altitude flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The rare instances of doors opening only occur under specific, low-pressure differential conditions near the ground. The aviation industry's rigorous investigation of accidents and incidents, like the Aloha Airlines case, continuously leads to improvements in aircraft design and procedures, making flying one of the safest modes of transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

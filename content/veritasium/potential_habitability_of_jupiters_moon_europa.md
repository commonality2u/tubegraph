Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, has long been considered a prime candidate in the [[search_for_alien_life_on_europa | search for alien life]] within our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This idea was even popularized in Arthur C. Clarke's 1982 novel "2010, Odyssey Two," where an alien intelligence warns humanity: "All these worlds are yours, except Europa, attempt no landing there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Forty-two years later, in October 2024, NASA is launching the [[europa_clipper_mission_and_challenges | Europa Clipper]] mission to specifically hunt for signs of life on this intriguing moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Hostile Environment of Jupiter

A significant challenge for life existing on Europa, and for any probe sent there, is Jupiter itself. Jupiter generates an incredibly powerful magnetic field, almost 20,000 times stronger than Earth's at the same distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This field is created by metallic liquid hydrogen deep within the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

At the heart of this magnetic field is Jupiter's moon Io, the most volcanically active world in the solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Io's volcanoes continuously eject tons of sulfur dioxide, with one ton becoming ionized and trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field every second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. These particles are accelerated to over 300 kilometers per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, forming massive, dangerous radiation belts that extend past Europa and other Jovian moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This intense radiation is detrimental to electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Past missions like Pioneer 10 and Voyager in the 1970s experienced glitches and data corruption from brief passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Even with modern shielding, a spacecraft within these belts would only survive for about three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Europa's surface radiation dose is 5,400 milliSieverts per day, 1,800 times the annual dose on Earth, enough to cause death from radiation sickness in a couple of hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Europa's Subsurface Ocean

Despite the harsh environment, Europa harbors a significant secret: a hidden ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Evidence for this ocean includes:

*   **Lack of Craters**: Images from Voyager 1 in 1979 revealed a surface with surprisingly few craters compared to other moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This suggests geological activity in the last 60 million years has erased them, constantly smoothing and renewing the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Induced Magnetic Field**: Galileo's magnetometer data from the 1990s showed that Jupiter's wobbling magnetic field induces a relatively strong magnetic field on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This indicates the presence of an electrically conductive layer, likely a saltwater ocean, close to the surface, possibly tens of kilometers deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Surface Composition**: Europa's white surface is mostly water ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Reddish-brown regions, when analyzed, could be hydrated salts, sulfuric acid, or even bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Recent experiments at JPL showed that sea salt, when exposed to intense radiation, turns this same brownish color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Scientists suspect a saltwater ocean up to 100 kilometers deep, meaning Europa could contain twice as much water as Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Tidal Flexing and Internal Heat

Despite Europa's surface temperature being below -160 degrees Celsius due to minimal sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, its ocean is believed to remain liquid. This is due to a process called **tidal flexing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Europa's orbit around Jupiter is not perfectly circular. This is caused by an orbital resonance with Io and Ganymede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Io pulls Europa inward on one side of its orbit, while Ganymede pulls it outward on the other, making the orbit eccentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. As Europa's distance from Jupiter changes, Jupiter's gravitational pull varies, causing the moon to be constantly stretched and squeezed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This internal friction generates enough heat to keep the subsurface ocean liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

If there were no ocean, Europa would flex by only about one meter in amplitude, but with an ocean, it flexes by 30 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This significant deflection is supported by the presence of "cycloids" on Europa's surfaceâ€”strange, arcuate features that form when a crack propagates through the ice shell, following the changing stress field induced by Jupiter's tidal forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Potential for Life

The tidal flexing is also thought to push magma closer to Europa's seafloor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Water circulating through the crust would be heated and pick up minerals, ejecting them into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This process creates **hydrothermal vents**, similar to those on Earth that host thriving ecosystems without sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Lifeforms at Earth's hydrothermal vents rely on unique bacteria that feed on minerals, rather than on solar energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

If Europa's ocean has existed for billions of years, life would have had ample opportunity to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Organisms could potentially use chemical reactions involving methane, carbon dioxide, or sulfur for metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Scientists anticipate finding single-celled organisms, not complex life like fish or whales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

Surprisingly, Jupiter's intense radiation might even *enhance* Europa's habitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. High-speed particles hitting Europa's surface provide energy to water and carbon dioxide molecules, forming new compounds like formaldehyde or hydrogen peroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. These compounds could serve as food for life if they can get down into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Evidence of "chaos zones" on the surface suggests the icy crust undergoes overturn, potentially allowing these compounds to be transported into the ice shell and even the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## The [[europa_clipper_mission_and_challenges | Europa Clipper]] and Future Missions

The [[europa_clipper_mission_and_challenges | Europa Clipper]], launching in October 2024, will not land on Europa or drill through its kilometers-thick ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Instead, it will perform 49 close flybys over four years, orbiting Jupiter from afar and only swooping in periodically to minimize radiation exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This strategy allows the mission to collect data during flybys and transmit it back to Earth during quieter periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The mission's instruments include:
*   **Ultraviolet Spectrograph**: To search for plumes of water shooting out from Europa's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. If detected, Clipper could fly through them like a "SnotBot" drone collects whale snot on Earth, allowing for chemical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Similar plumes have been observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, and the Hubble Space Telescope has picked up evidence of similar eruptions on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Mass Spectrometer**: To determine the chemical composition of any plumes encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Infrared Spectrometer**: To identify chemical fingerprints of light bounced off the surface, helping to map salts and look for organic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Cameras (Wide and Narrow Angle)**: To image nearly the entire globe at resolutions better than 100 meters per pixel, with the narrow angle camera capable of half-meter per pixel images from 50 kilometers altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

While Enceladus has confirmed plumes and a near-certain subsurface ocean, Europa is considered a stronger candidate for life due to the longer potential duration of its ocean, allowing for more time for life to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

The [[europa_clipper_mission_and_challenges | Europa Clipper]] will not be alone. The European Space Agency's (ESA) JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) mission is already en route to Jupiter, arriving 15 months after Clipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. JUICE will also perform a few flybys of Europa before orbiting Ganymede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. There will be informal [[NASA_and_ESA_collaborative_efforts_in_space_exploration | collaborative efforts]] and data sharing between the two missions to maximize scientific returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

The first distant observations from [[europa_clipper_mission_and_challenges | Europa Clipper]] are expected in 2030, with high-resolution data following in 2031 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. A future mission, a lander, would be required to actually search for signs of life on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Studies suggest such a lander could survive for about a month on the surface, allowing it to scoop up material from below the radiation-processed depth for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

The deliberate crashing of the Galileo mission into Jupiter in 2003 was done to avoid contaminating Europa, highlighting the serious consideration given to the potential for life on this moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. With the launch of [[europa_clipper_mission_and_challenges | Europa Clipper]], humanity is closer than ever to answering the profound question of whether we are alone in the solar system.

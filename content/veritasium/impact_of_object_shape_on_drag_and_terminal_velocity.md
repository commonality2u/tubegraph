The shape of an object significantly influences both the [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] it experiences and its [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] when falling through a fluid like air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. [[Impact of fluid flow on aerodynamics and efficiency | Aerodynamics]] and the way air flows around an object are crucial factors in determining how fast an object can fall and its potential for impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

## Understanding Terminal Velocity and Air Resistance

Terminal velocity is the maximum speed an object will reach in free fall through still air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. It is achieved when the force of gravity pulling an object down is equal to the force of [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] pushing it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

A classic experiment illustrating this is dropping a hammer and a feather simultaneously:
*   **On the Moon**: In the near vacuum of the moon's surface, both objects speed up at the same rate due to gravity and hit the ground at the same time, as there is virtually no [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **On Earth**: On Earth, the hammer lands much faster than the feather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. The feather quickly reaches its [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] and falls at a constant speed, while the hammer continues to accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This is because, although the hammer experiences greater [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] due to its higher speed, its weight is significantly greater, making drag negligible in comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. It all comes down to the ratio of weight to [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

### Influence of Weight, Size, and Air Density

*   **Weight (Same Size/Shape)**: Objects of the same size and shape experience the same [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. However, a heavier object will have a higher [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Weight-to-Drag Ratio (Different Size/Shape)**: Some objects, despite having very different sizes, shapes, and weights (e.g., a person and a lacrosse ball), can have the same [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] if the ratio of their weight to [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Air Density**: [[Effect of air resistance on falling objects | Air resistance]] is directly proportional to the density of the air an object is moving through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. At higher altitudes where air is less dense, objects will achieve much faster [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. For example, Felix Baumgartner reached over 1300 kilometers per hour in the stratosphere due to the air being 60 times less dense than at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

## The Drag Coefficient

The impact of an object's overall shape on [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] is quantified by a dimensionless number called the Drag Coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>. This coefficient indicates how smoothly air flows around an object without creating vortices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.

A sphere, for instance, has a drag coefficient of 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. Modern bullet shapes, designed to reduce drag, have drag coefficients between 0.1 and 0.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. This modification of shape is why a modern bullet (originally a "boulette" or small ball) is no longer spherical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

## Case Studies: Common Falling Objects

### Pennies
*   **Weight and Initial Speed**: A penny weighs about 2.5 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Without [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]], a penny dropped from the Empire State Building (443 meters) would accelerate to over 300 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **Terminal Velocity**: Pennies reach [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] after falling only about 15 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Their maximum [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] is approximately 80 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. This means dropping them from a greater height, like the Empire State Building, would not increase their speed upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
*   **Tumbling Behavior**: Pennies tend to flutter and tumble as they fall, rather than falling straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. This tumbling means a penny doesn't have a single [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]]; it oscillates between one on its face and one on its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. This behavior was demonstrated in a custom wind tunnel with a gradient of wind speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: A falling penny delivers about a fifth of a Joule of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]], which is not enough to cause serious harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>.

### Ballpoint Pens
*   **Characteristics**: Ballpoint pens are about twice as heavy as pennies and have a smaller cross-sectional area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. This increases their weight-to-drag ratio compared to pennies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Despite these factors, plastic ballpoint pens still have too much drag relative to their weight to achieve a high enough [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] to be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

### Raindrops and Hail
*   **Raindrops**: Raindrops range from 0.5 to 4 millimeters in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. They have a low [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] of just 25 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Raindrops are not shaped like cartoons; they are closer to spherical, but flatter on the bottom where they encounter oncoming air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. If a raindrop gets too big, it flattens, caves in, and breaks into smaller droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. A raindrop only delivers 0.002 Joules of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>.
*   **Hail**: Hail can reach [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocities]] of over 200 km/h, about 10 times that of rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. The primary reason for its higher speed is that hail can get much larger than raindrops, up to 20 centimeters in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. Drag is proportional to cross-sectional area (radius squared), while weight scales with radius cubed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. Therefore, the bigger the hailstone, the faster its [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. Larger hailstones also have more mass, delivering more [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. A large hailstone can deliver over 80 Joules of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]], sufficient to fracture a human skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>.

### Bullets
*   **Dropped from height**: If a bullet is dropped from a skyscraper, it will tumble and likely end up falling on its side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. Cylinders tend to fall on their sides because the object finds the orientation of highest [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] to be the most stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. A bullet fired straight up will tumble on its way down, experiencing more [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] and thus reaching the ground much slower than its initial launch speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.
*   **Fired at an angle (celebratory gunfire)**: If a bullet is fired at an angle, it maintains horizontal velocity at its peak trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. Combined with the spin imparted by the gun barrel's grooves, this keeps it moving pointy-end forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. As a result, it speeds up to a significant fraction of its launch speed on the way down, posing a much greater danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>.

### Fléchettes and Lazy Dogs
*   **Design**: These were small metal pieces dropped from planes during World War I and later conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. Fléchettes ("little arrows") looked like nails with small feathers on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. The feathers ensured they fell straight, maintaining an aerodynamic profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>. Lazy Dogs used in the Korean and Vietnam wars were similar but heftier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Although the [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | energy]] stored in a falling flechette might not be enough to fracture a skull, their pointed shape allows them to apply a large force to a very small area, enabling them to pierce helmets and cause nasty injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: What Makes a Projectile Deadly?

The lower limit of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | energy]] required to fracture a human skull is around 68 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

*   **Not Lethal**: Objects weighing a few grams that are not aerodynamic, like pennies and plastic pens, are unlikely to be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>. Their [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] is too low, and the [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] delivered is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>.
*   **Lethal**: Objects weighing more than a few hundred grams traveling at [[terminal_velocity_of_different_objects | terminal velocity]] are likely to be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>. Examples include baseballs, large hailstones (over 80 Joules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>, and even a falling measuring tape (which killed a man after falling 50 stories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. Sharp or pointed objects, like flechettes, can be dangerous even with lower [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | energy]] due to concentrating force on a small area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>.

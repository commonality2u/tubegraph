The Tatara method is an ancient Japanese steel-making process that has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years, with everything done by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Steel produced using this method is exclusively used in the very best Japanese swords, which are still considered among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These swords were developed as the absolute pinnacle for the style of warfare and materials available in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. One such sword from the 16th century was appraised at $105 million, making it the most expensive sword ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Historical Context

Japanese sword making dates back approximately 3000 years, initially producing bronze swords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The discovery of metal smelting might have been related to pottery, where metallic beads were found at the bottom of furnaces used for glazes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, has low enough melting points to be smelted in regular pottery kilns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. However, bronze is too soft to hold a sharp edge for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Japanese sword makers transitioned to steel 1200 years ago during the Heian period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Steel is an alloy of iron, the fourth most common element in Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Japan was late to steel production, with artifacts found in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) dating back nearly 4,000 years, while Japan imported metals until the 8th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Raw Materials: Iron Sand

Most of the world's iron comes from banded iron formations, layered sedimentary rock formed when cyanobacteria's photosynthesis caused dissolved iron to precipitate out of ancient oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. These formations can contain up to 60% iron oxide by weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

However, Japan, with its mostly volcanic geology, has very few of these sedimentary iron oxides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Instead, the Japanese utilized iron oxides found in igneous rocks like granite and diorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. As mountains weathered, these iron oxides broke apart and were washed downstream, becoming part of the sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Recognizing that iron oxides are denser than other minerals, they observed these oxides accumulating where rivers changed direction or speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. To enhance this, they created deliberate diversions in rivers, damming sections and dragging sand into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This process allowed them to achieve iron sands with up to 80% iron oxides by weight, making it a highly concentrated source of high-quality iron with fewer impurities than typical iron ore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## The Tatara Smelting Process

The Tatara method of steelmaking takes place in the Shimane province of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The smelter is only lit for one night each year, producing steel in the same way it was done 1300 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Preparation and Operation

The process begins just after 9:00 AM with ceremonial prayers led by a Shinto priest, who also lights the fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. All workers, including the Veritasium producer Petr, remain committed for at least 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

A crucial component is charcoal, which is basically pure carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. When heated to over 1,250 degrees Celsius, iron oxides break bonds with oxygen to yield pure iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Pure iron is softer than bronze, but adding a small amount of carbon creates the incredibly strong alloy known as steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Alloys are stronger than pure metals because different sized atoms reduce the ability of atoms to slide past each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Iron sand is mixed with water to prevent it from flying up when added to the flame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. However, too much water can cause the kiln to explode as water vaporizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This delicate balance is determined by feel, mixing until the iron sand becomes clumpy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Smelting Process

To maintain the high temperatures (up to 1500 degrees Celsius) required for steelmaking, a strong, steady supply of oxygen is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Historically, this was achieved using huge, foot-operated bellows, requiring continuous effort from many men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Today, electric bellows are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

The temperature inside the smelter is just below iron's melting point of 1538 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This means the iron remains soft and malleable, clumping into a large block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Impurities like sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon oxides combine with carbon from the charcoal, melt at a lower temperature than iron, and flow to the bottom as slag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Throughout the 21-hour smelting period, charcoal and iron sand are continually added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The slag is periodically removed, with the first removal preceded by another prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This involves opening the smelter from the bottom and breaking apart impurities to allow them to flow out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Output and Sorting

After 21 hours of smelting, a total of 614 kilograms of iron sand and 670 kilograms of charcoal are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The result is a 100-kilogram block of steel, iron, and slag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Only about one-third of this block is of high enough quality for sword making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

The steel is then sorted by quality and carbon content, primarily by eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This sorting is one of the exams required to be certified as a swordsmith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The sorted grades of steel are then distributed to one of the 300 swordsmiths across Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

[[Einsteins general theory of relativity | According to the general theory of relativity]], gravity is not a force and there are no gravitational fields; gravity is instead described as an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This theory predicts that massive objects curve [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]], influencing the path of light and matter.

## The Prediction of Light Bending
[[Einsteins equivalence principle and its implications | Einstein's equivalence principle]] suggests that an accelerating frame of reference will bend light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. This concept was derived from the idea that being at rest in a gravitational field is identical to accelerating in deep space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

In an accelerating rocket, an external observer would see light travel in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. However, inside the rocket, as the rocket speeds up, the light would appear to hit the opposite wall a little lower than its source, meaning light deflects downwards in an accelerating frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

From this, Einstein reasoned that light must also bend when it passes a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The ideal experiment to test this would involve observing light from distant stars as it passes just next to the Sun, the only obvious huge mass near Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. However, the Sun's brightness typically prevents observation of stars directly beside it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## The 1919 Solar Eclipse Experiment
The opportunity to test this prediction arose during a total solar eclipse in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. During the eclipse, Sir Arthur Eddington set out to take pictures of stars located right next to the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## Validation of [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | General Relativity]]
By analyzing these pictures, Eddington found that the apparent positions of the stars were deflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This deflection matched the precise amount predicted by [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Notably, this result was twice the deflection calculated using a strictly Newtonian model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

Since this seminal experiment, [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | general relativity]] has successfully passed virtually every test conducted over the past century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

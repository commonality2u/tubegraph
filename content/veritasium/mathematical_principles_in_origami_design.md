The ancient art of paper folding, [[Origami in modern engineering | origami]], has become increasingly useful for modern engineering applications due to its underlying mathematical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While dating back at least 400 years in Japan, the number of documented designs has expanded significantly from a handful to tens of thousands, with much of this change occurring in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Japanese origami masters, particularly Akira Yoshizawa, inspired a worldwide renaissance of origami creativity by creating thousands of new designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Role of Mathematics

[[Innovations in origamiinspired technology | Origami]] is a powerful method for transforming a flat sheet into a complex three-dimensional shape with relatively little processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Many modern applications, from medical devices to space technology, benefit from origami's ability to create specific functional motions and enable miniaturization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The design of complex origami forms relies heavily on [[Mathematical reasoning and coin rotation paradox | mathematical methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The curvature of lines and how they interact through bending are all coupled, making mathematical approaches essential for designing and ensuring all folds work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

This approach extends to origami, where describing origami using mathematical tools has proven successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

## Core Mathematical Concepts in Design

### Crease Patterns and Circle Packing

A fundamental concept in origami design is the **crease pattern**, which serves as a plan for how to fold a specific shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. A highly effective method for designing complex patterns, particularly for shapes that can be represented as "stick figures" (e.g., a scorpion with legs, claws, and a tail), is the **circle packing method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Representing Features:** Each feature of the desired shape (e.g., a scorpion's claw, leg, or tail) is conceptually represented by a circular region or "circle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. These circles can be of different sizes based on the feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
2.  **Arrangement (Packing):** These abstract circles are then "packed" into a square piece of paper, much like packing balls into a box, ensuring they all fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
3.  **Constructing the Crease Pattern:** The arrangement of these circles forms the "skeleton" of the crease pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Geometrical rules are applied:
    *   A line is drawn between the center of every pair of circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
    *   Whenever two lines meet in a V-shape, a "ridge fold" is added halfway between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
    *   More complicated rules add additional lines step-by-step based on geometric patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
4.  **Final Pattern:** Once all lines are constructed, the circles (which acted as scaffolding) are removed, leaving the precise pattern of folds needed to create the desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This systematic process revolutionized origami design, ensuring the fold pattern precisely yielded the intended shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Origamizer Algorithm for Surfaces

For shapes that are not "stick figures" but rather continuous surfaces, like a sphere or a blobby animal, a different algorithm is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Around 10 years ago, Japanese mathematician Tomohiro Tachi developed an algorithm called **Origamizer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This algorithm takes a triangulated surface as a [[mathematical reasoning and coin rotation paradox | mathematical]] description and outputs the folding pattern that will form that surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Origamizer makes it possible to take a flat sheet of any material and form it into virtually any three-dimensional shape by folding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[Origami in modern engineering | utility of origami in engineering]] stems from its ability to:
*   Transform flat materials into complex shapes through folding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   Reduce dimensions for compact storage while maintaining easy deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   Increase rigidity or create specific motions through folding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   Scale principles for miniaturization of devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

Translating these ideas into practical solutions, as seen in applications like surgical tools, bulletproof walls, and deployable solar panels, requires significant [[Mathematical reasoning and coin rotation paradox | mathematical modeling]] and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. The bright ideas developed over centuries of paper folding are being systematically harnessed and expanded upon through rigorous mathematical methods.

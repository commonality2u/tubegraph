From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The [[principle_of_least_action_in_quantum_mechanics | principle of least action]] is a single, simple rule that underpins all of [[Physics and aerodynamic principles | physics]], including classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum theory, and general relativity, down to the fundamental particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This rule can effectively replace all other physical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It suggests that the local, differential equation way of thinking about the universe might be backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> and may even explain the behavior of life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Problem of Fastest Descent (Brachistochrone)

The concept begins with a simple problem: determining the shape of a ramp that allows a mass to slide from point A to point B in the fastest possible time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This is known as the problem of fastest descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Common sense might suggest a straight line, the shortest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, bending the ramp downwards at the start allows the mass to accelerate to a higher speed earlier, leading to a faster overall travel time, even if the path is slightly longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The challenge was to find the perfect balance between acceleration and path length to minimize travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Galileo believed the fastest shape was the arc of a circle, proving it was faster than any polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
Nearly 60 years later, in June 1696, Johann Bernoulli posed this problem as a challenge to the world's best mathematicians, largely to demonstrate his own superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. After no solutions were submitted within the initial six months, Gottfried Leibniz convinced Bernoulli to extend the deadline for "foreigners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Sir Isaac Newton was likely the intended target of this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Newton, then the warden of the Mint, received the challenge on January 29, 1697 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Despite his irritation, he spent the day and night solving it, completing it by 4:00 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Newton anonymously submitted his solution to the journal *Philosophical Transactions* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Upon seeing it, Bernoulli famously remarked, "I recognize the lion by his claw," knowing only Newton could provide such a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Although Newton generally surpassed Bernoulli, Bernoulli's solution to this specific problem was considered more elegant and creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Fermat's Principle of Least Time

Bernoulli's clever solution was inspired by an ancient problem concerning how light travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Hero of Alexandria (1st century AD) observed that in a single medium, light always follows the shortest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This explains why the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when light reflects off a surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. However, when light moves from one medium to another (e.g., air to water), it refracts, bending in a way that doesn't follow the shortest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This phenomenon causes objects underwater to appear in a different position than they actually are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

Over 1,600 years, Snell's Law was developed, stating that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant (n) dependent on the two media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The reason *why* it worked remained unknown until 1657 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Pierre Fermat, a judge and mathematician, became interested in light's refraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. He hypothesized that perhaps it wasn't distance but *time* that light minimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Fermat eventually proved that Snell's Law emerges naturally if light takes the path of shortest travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The constant 'n' in Snell's Law is simply the ratio of the speed of light in the first medium to its speed in the second medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Fermat called this discovery "the most extraordinary, the most unforeseen, and the happiest calculation" of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. [[Physics and aerodynamic principles | Fermat's principle of least time]] was the first demonstration that nature obeys an optimization principle, always performing the "best possible thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Bernoulli's Use of Fermat's Principle

Bernoulli applied [[Physics and aerodynamic principles | Fermat's principle of least time]] to solve the problem of fastest descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. He transformed the mechanics problem of a sliding particle into an optics problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. He imagined a ray of light passing through layers of media with decreasing density, causing it to accelerate like a falling object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. As the layers become infinitesimally thin, this creates a continuous curve where Snell's Law applies at each interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

By applying the conservation of energy to the falling particle (kinetic energy gained from potential energy loss), Bernoulli found that the particle's velocity at any point `y` is proportional to the square root of `y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. He then equated this to the changing speed of light in his optical analogy. Plugging this velocity relationship into Snell's Law at each layer, he realized that the ratio `sin(angle) / sqrt(y)` must be constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Bernoulli immediately recognized this equation as describing a cycloid, the path traced by a point on a rolling wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This curve is also known as a brachistochrone, meaning "shortest time" in Greek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

A surprising property of the cycloid is that regardless of the starting point on the curve, a mass always reaches the end in the same amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. For this reason, it is also known as the tautochrone curve ("same time" in Greek) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Bernoulli was astonished that two seemingly separate problems in optics and mechanics had the same character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Maupertuis and the Principle of Least Action

About 40 years later, Pierre Louis de Maupertuis, one of Bernoulli's students, observed similarities in the behavior of light and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. He questioned whether [[Physics and aerodynamic principles | Fermat's principle of least time]] was the most fundamental, suggesting a more foundational minimized quantity that governed both light and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

In the 1740s, Maupertuis proposed a new quantity called "action," defined as mass times velocity times distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. He posited that the farther, faster, or more massive something is, the greater its action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. For a multi-segment journey, total action is the sum of action for each segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Maupertuis claimed that out of all possible trajectories, a system would follow the path that minimized this action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. In 1744, he wrote that action is "the true expense of Nature, which she manages to make as small as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

Maupertuis' idea was met with ridicule and attack, including accusations of plagiarism from Gottfried Leibniz and Voltaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Voltaire even published a 32-page pamphlet mocking him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This negative reception was partly justified because Maupertuis' principle was not rigorously derived and had no obvious reason why nature should minimize "mass times velocity times distance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Euler and Lagrange's Contributions

Leonhard Euler vehemently defended Maupertuis' principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Euler replaced the sum in the action definition with an integral, allowing for continuous changes in speed or direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. He used this to find the path of a particle orbiting a central mass, like a planet around a star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This required finding the path with the smallest action among infinitely many possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. To do this, Euler invented a new mathematical method, although it was cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. He realized that the [[principle_of_least_action_in_quantum_mechanics | principle of least action]] only works if the total energy is conserved and is the same for all paths considered, conditions Maupertuis had not recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Joseph-Louis Lagrange, a self-taught mathematician, corresponded with Euler and refined Euler's methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Both Euler and Lagrange were strong proponents of the [[principle_of_least_action_in_quantum_mechanics | principle of least action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Around five years after Maupertuis' death, Lagrange provided a general proof for the principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## Modern Formulation: Hamilton's Principle

Euler and Lagrange developed a general approach to finding the path of least action, similar to finding the minimum of a function by setting its derivative to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. If a path has the least action, tiny variations to it (adding a small function 'eta') should result in essentially no change in action to first order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. This means the difference in action between a trial path and the true path is zero to first order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

Maupertuis' action (sum of mass times velocity times distance) was refined by Euler into an integral of mass times velocity integrated over distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. By substituting `ds = v dt`, this becomes the integral of twice the kinetic energy (`mv^2`) over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Using Euler's condition that total energy (`E`) is conserved (`T = E - V`, where T is kinetic energy and V is potential energy), the action can be rewritten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. If one considers only paths with the same travel time, the variation of the action becomes the variation of kinetic energy minus potential energy integrated over time, which equals zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

This formulation, where action is the integral of (kinetic energy - potential energy) over time, was introduced by William Rowan Hamilton in 1834, leading to the name **Hamilton's Principle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. In Hamilton's Principle, the action is an integral over time, and both the start/end points and start/end times must be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. This contrasts with Maupertuis' principle, where energy must be conserved across paths, but time can vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

### Equivalence to Newton's Second Law

To show why Hamilton's Principle works, consider a ball thrown vertically. Infinitely many possible trajectories connect its start and end points within a fixed time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. By imagining tiny variations (`eta`) to the true path (`y`), the difference in action between the true path and a trial path (`q = y + eta`) is zero to first order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

Solving this equation, which involves computing the kinetic and potential energies as functions of `y` and `eta` and using integration by parts, reveals a curious differential equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. This equation simplifies to `F = ma` (Force equals mass times acceleration), which is Newton's Second Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

Therefore, the [[principle_of_least_action_in_quantum_mechanics | principle of least action]] is equivalent to Newton's Second Law, but it encompasses more than just mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. [[Physics and aerodynamic principles | Fermat's principle of least time]] is a special case of the [[principle_of_least_action_in_quantum_mechanics | principle of least action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. This single principle unifies phenomena from light reflection/refraction to pendulum swings and planetary orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The core idea is that "the variation of the action is 0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

## The Lagrangian Approach

With Lagrange's proof, there are two ways to solve mechanics problems: using forces and vectors (Newtonian mechanics) or using energies and scalars (Lagrangian mechanics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. While the [[principle_of_least_action_in_quantum_mechanics | principle of least action]] might seem overly complicated compared to F=ma, Euler and Lagrange simplified its application significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

The quantity (kinetic energy - potential energy), or `T - V`, is called the **Lagrangian (L)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. The [[principle_of_least_action_in_quantum_mechanics | principle of least action]] works whenever a specific differential equation, known as the **Euler-Lagrange equation**, is satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. To solve any mechanics problem using this method, one simply writes down the kinetic and potential energies, plugs them into the Euler-Lagrange equation, and obtains the correct equations of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

This approach is powerful because it works in multiple dimensions by solving the Euler-Lagrange equation for each coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. It also allows the use of [[Counterintuitive engineering concepts | weird coordinate systems]] (e.g., polar coordinates for rotational problems), simplifying problem-solving compared to vector-based methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. Complex systems like a double pendulum, which are extremely difficult to solve with forces, become much easier with the Lagrangian approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

### Principle of Stationary Action

It's important to note a caveat about the name "principle of least action." While often the action is minimized, it's not always a true minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. Just as setting a derivative to zero in calculus doesn't guarantee a minimum (it could be a maximum or a saddle point), the principle more accurately describes a "stationary point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. The laws of motion derive from demanding a stationary action, meaning the first-order change in action for tiny path deviations is zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. Thus, it is more accurately called the **Principle of Stationary Action** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.

## Broader Significance

The action is more fundamental than just classical mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. Around the turn of the 20th century, action emerged as a key component in solving the UV catastrophe, a major problem in atomic [[Physics and aerodynamic principles | physics]], thus playing a role in the development of quantum theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. This demonstrates how deeply ingrained the concept of action is in the fundamental laws of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.

## Introduction
The single sentence of Euclid's fifth postulate, long suspected as a mistake in one of the oldest math books, "Elements," held the key to understanding our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This skepticism ultimately led to the realization that Euclid wasn't wrong, but that slight modifications to this postulate could open up strange new universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Surprisingly, 80 years later, these "strange new universes" proved core to understanding our own universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Euclid's Elements and the Problem of Definitions
Around 300 BC, the Greek mathematician Euclid undertook a massive project to summarize all known mathematics, creating what was intended to be the definitive math text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Before Euclid, mathematics suffered from circular reasoning, where proofs relied on concepts that were themselves unproven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Euclid resolved this by establishing a few fundamental, simple truths as postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. From these postulates, he logically proved theorems, ensuring that as long as the initial statements were true, everything derived from them must also be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This method perfected the gold standard for rigorous mathematical proof upon which all modern math relies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Euclid applied this method in his 13-book series, "The Elements," proving 465 theorems covering most of the mathematics known at the time, including geometry and number theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. These theorems were based on definitions, common notions, and five postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Euclid's Postulates
The first four postulates are relatively simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
1.  **Postulate 1**: You can draw a straight line between any two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
2.  **Postulate 2**: A straight line can be extended indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  **Postulate 3**: Given a center and a radius, you can draw a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
4.  **Postulate 4**: All right angles are equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### The Fifth Postulate (Parallel Postulate)
Euclid's fifth postulate, however, stood out due to its complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>:
> "If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side, on which are the angles less than the two right angles." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

This verbose and seemingly less obvious postulate led mathematicians for over 2,000 years to suspect it was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Many, including Greek philosopher Proclus, believed it should be a theorem provable from the first four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Despite numerous attempts by Ptolemy, Proclus, and others, direct proofs failed, often simply restating the postulate in different words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

One common formulation of the fifth postulate is: "If you have a line, and a point that is not on that line, then there is a single unique line which will be parallel to the first line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. For this reason, it is often called the **Parallel Postulate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Attempts at Proof by Contradiction
Mathematicians like al-Haytham and Omar Khayyam tried a different approach: proof by contradiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This involved keeping the first four postulates the same but assuming the fifth postulate was false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. If this led to a contradiction, it would prove Euclid's fifth postulate was correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

There were two main alternatives if the fifth postulate were false:
1.  **No parallel lines**: This scenario was ruled out as it implied that lines must be finite in length, contradicting Euclid's second postulate that lines can be extended indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
2.  **More than one parallel line**: Mathematicians assumed this must be wrong but failed to find a contradiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

After over 2,000 years, all attempts to prove the fifth postulate failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## János Bolyai's Discovery of Non-Euclidean Geometry
Around 1820, a 17-year-old student named János Bolyai dedicated himself to solving this mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. His father, Farkas Bolyai, who had also struggled with the problem, warned him to "leave the science of parallels alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. However, the young Bolyai persisted and realized that the fifth postulate might be completely independent of the other four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Bolyai imagined a world where more than one parallel line could pass through a point not on a given line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. He realized this was possible if the surface was curved, rather than flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. On such curved surfaces, the shortest paths between two points are called **geodesics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. These geodesics are considered "straight" lines in that geometry, even if they appear bent from an external perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This concept led to what is now known as [[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | hyperbolic geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Hyperbolic Geometry
[[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | Hyperbolic geometry]] can be visualized not as a single saddle shape, but as an infinitely crumpling mess resembling a crocheted piece of fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. As one moves outwards from the center, more and more fabric is created, pushing parallel lines apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

A common model for visualizing the infinite [[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | hyperbolic plane]] is the **Poincare Disk Model** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. In this model, the entire infinite plane is mapped into a finite disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Triangles appear smaller towards the edge of the disk, but they are actually the same size in the [[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | hyperbolic plane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Straight lines in this model are arcs of circles that intersect the disk at 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Bolyai, without a physical model, demonstrated that [[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | hyperbolic geometry]] was mathematically consistent, just like Euclid's geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

In 1823, the 20-year-old Bolyai declared, "Out of nothing, I have created a strange new universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Bolyai's Life and Gauss's Independent Discovery
Beyond his mathematical pursuits, Bolyai was also a master violinist and duelist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. His arrogance and difficulty accepting authority led to a famous incident where he fought and won 13 duels in succession, taking breaks to play his violin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

In 1832, Bolyai published his findings as a 24-page appendix to his father's textbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Farkas Bolyai proudly sent it to Carl Friedrich Gauss, one of the greatest mathematicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Gauss replied that the work "coincides almost exactly with my own meditations, which have occupied my mind for the past 30 or 35 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

Indeed, Gauss had privately discovered a "curious geometry" in 1824, which he described as having "paradoxical, and to the uninitiated, absurd theorems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. For example, in this geometry, the three angles of a triangle can become as small as desired if the sides are large enough, yet the area of the triangle never exceeds a definite limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This can be seen in the Poincare disk model, where large triangles have angles that approach zero, but their area remains finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Gauss concluded that this "non-Euclidean geometry" seemed thoroughly consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. However, he chose not to publish his findings "for fear of ridicule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

Bolyai was devastated by Gauss's response, believing his ideas were being undermined, and never published again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. He also later learned that Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky had independently discovered non-Euclidean geometry several years before his own publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Despite Bolyai's bitterness, Gauss privately acknowledged him as "a genius of the first order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Spherical Geometry as a Non-Euclidean Geometry
Before 1854, [[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | spherical geometry]] was not considered non-Euclidean because its "straight lines" (great circles, like the equator or lines of longitude on Earth) cannot be extended indefinitely, violating Euclid's second postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. On a sphere, any two great circles will intersect twice, meaning there are no parallel lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

In 1854, Bernhard Riemann generalized the second postulate from "infinite extension" to "unbounded," allowing spherical geometry to be considered another valid [[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | non-Euclidean geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. By using the generalized four postulates and assuming no parallel lines for the fifth, one could derive spherical or elliptic geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

Gauss, who was also a geodesist and frequently took measurements of the Earth, had precisely measured angles of a large triangle formed by three mountains in the Kingdom of Hanover in the 1820s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. While some speculate he was trying to measure the curvature of space itself, the angles he found were 180 degrees within observational error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## Euclid's True "Mistake" and the Nature of Geometry
While Euclid was right to include the fifth postulate as a distinct axiom, his true "mistake" lay in his attempt to define fundamental terms like "point" and "line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. These definitions often relied on other undefined terms, leading to an infinite recursion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. Modern mathematics instead uses *undefined terms* and focuses on the relationships between objects as defined by the postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

Geometry can be thought of as a game: the first four postulates are minimum rules, and the fifth postulate selects the "world" you play in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>:
*   **Spherical Geometry**: No parallel lines (angles of a triangle sum to >180 degrees).
*   **Flat (Euclidean) Geometry**: One parallel line (angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees).
*   **[[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | Hyperbolic Geometry]]**: More than one parallel line (angles of a triangle sum to <180 degrees).

In 1854, Riemann went further, laying the groundwork for a geometry where curvature could differ from place to place, extendable to three or more dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami unequivocally proved that [[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | hyperbolic and spherical geometries]] were just as consistent as Euclid's flat geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Non-Euclidean Geometries and General Relativity
The discovery of non-Euclidean geometries proved to be just the beginning. In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity, which showed that space and time are relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This presented a problem for Newtonian gravity, where the force of gravity depended on distances that were no longer well-defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

In 1907, Einstein had his "happiest thought" realizing that free fall in a uniform gravitational field is identical to being in deep space, experiencing no gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This implied that gravity is not a force, but rather a manifestation of **curved spacetime** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Massive objects curve spacetime, and objects moving through this curved spacetime follow the shortest path, a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Thus, an orbiting space station follows a straight line in curved spacetime, appearing curved to a distant observer because Earth curves the spacetime around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

The behavior of straight lines in curved geometries is therefore core to understanding our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Einstein's general theory of relativity, published over a hundred years ago, has been remarkably successful, with countless findings supporting its predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Gravitational Lensing**: A massive galaxy between a supernova and Earth can curve spacetime, causing light from the supernova to take multiple paths and appear in several different places, acting as a gravitational lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
*   **Gravitational Waves**: Ripples in spacetime formed by cosmic events like black hole mergers can now be measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

## Determining the Shape of the Universe
The overall shape of the entire universe can be determined by measuring the angles of a cosmic triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Flat Geometry**: Angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees.
*   **[[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | Spherical Geometry]]**: Angles sum to more than 180 degrees.
*   **[[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | Hyperbolic Geometry]]**: Angles sum to less than 180 degrees.

Gauss's terrestrial measurements were too small to detect the curvature of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. To overcome this, astronomers use the largest possible triangles by looking back in time to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the first light we can see from when the universe was 380,000 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. By measuring the angular size of temperature variations in the CMB (which are predicted to be of a certain physical size based on early universe evolution), scientists can infer the universe's geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

Data from missions like Planck show that the measured angular sizes in the CMB almost exactly match what would be expected if the universe were flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. The current best estimate for the curvature of the universe is 0.0007 ± 0.0019, which is effectively zero within the margin of error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. This suggests that the universe we live in is flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

The flatness of the universe is remarkably serendipitous; a slight increase or decrease in its average mass-energy density would result in a spherically or [[hyperbolic_and_spherical_geometries | hyperbolically curved geometry]], respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. At its core, modern physics relies on the "paradoxical and seemingly absurd geometries" discovered because mathematicians spent over 2,000 years contemplating a single sentence from Euclid's "Elements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

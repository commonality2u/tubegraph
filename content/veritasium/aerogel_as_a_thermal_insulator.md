[[properties_of_aerogel | Aerogel]] is known as the world's lightest, or least dense, solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A specific piece shown has a mass of just 1.22 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, only a few times the mass of the same volume of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This is because it is 99.8% air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, and some [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogels]] can even be less dense than air if all the air were removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This unique composition contributes significantly to its extraordinary [[Thermal insulation capabilities of aerogel | thermal insulating]] properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Demonstration of Insulating Power

An experiment was conducted to demonstrate the [[Thermal insulation capabilities of aerogel | insulating power]] of [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] using chocolate bunnies and a Bunsen burner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Control Experiment (Glass Petri Dish)
Two setups were prepared: one with a glass petri dish and the other with [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Both are made of silica but have very different physical structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Using a FLIR T1020 thermal camera, which can detect temperatures up to 2,000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, it was observed that the glass became very hot quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. After just one minute, the chocolate bunny on the glass began to smoke and melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, tilting to the side as it liquefied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The petri dish also cracked under the thermal expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Aerogel Experiment
In contrast, when the experiment was repeated with [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, after nearly three minutes, there was still no sign of melted chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The flame temperature underneath the [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] was measured at 600 degrees Celsius (1250 Fahrenheit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, yet the top of the [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] remained cool enough to touch, being only "warm to the touch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Some melting occurred around the edges where convective heat moved up and around the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. By four minutes, the bunny was only slightly soft, an impressive result considering how easily chocolate melts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The chocolate, once tested, was warm and delicious, akin to fondue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Scientific Explanation of Insulation

Although [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] is largely comprised of air (99%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, it has superior [[Thermal insulation capabilities of aerogel | thermal properties]] compared to air itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

> "It's actually a better insulator than air is." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>

This enhanced insulation is due to the nanoscale pores within the [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The width of these pores is smaller than the average distance air molecules travel before colliding with something, known as their mean free path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This phenomenon, called the [[Thermal insulation capabilities of aerogel | Knudsen effect]], makes it difficult for hot, fast-moving air molecules to diffuse through the [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] and transfer heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## [[Practical applications of aerogel | Practical Applications]]

### Space Technology
NASA has utilized [[Thermal insulation capabilities of aerogel | aerogel insulation]] on several Mars missions, including the Sojourner Rover, Spirit and Opportunity, and the Curiosity Rover, with plans for its use on future missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This is essential to prevent electronics from getting too cold during the extremely cold Martian nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

NASA has also found more exotic uses for [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]], such as capturing comet dust during the Stardust mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. When particles traveling at about six kilometers per second hit the very low-density, porous [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]], they enter the material, break apart its network, lose energy, and come to a stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This method is effective for capturing particles without vaporizing them, unlike hitting a solid surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Future Developments

While [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] is an exceptional insulator, its widespread everyday use is currently limited due to cost and durability challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. For example, it is noted that while it is cool to the touch, [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] is very [[challenges_of_working_with_brittle_aerogel | brittle]] and "not hard to break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Scientists are actively working on [[future_developments_and_challenges_for_aerogel | reducing costs and increasing durability]] of [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Significant progress has already been made; for instance, original silica [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] is hydrophilic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> and can be ruined by water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. However, there are now ways to make it [[applications_of_aerogel_in_waterproofing_and_insulation | waterproof]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. If these challenges are overcome, [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] could potentially revolutionize insulation in applications such as skyscrapers in extremely cold environments like Antarctica, where a few inches of [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] could replace feet of traditional fiberglass insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

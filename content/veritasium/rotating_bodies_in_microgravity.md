The behavior of rotating objects in [[challenges_of_microgravity_and_its_effects_on_the_human_body | microgravity]] can reveal counterintuitive phenomena, most notably the [[unique_phenomena_in_zerogravity_settings_such_as_the_intermediate_axis_theorem | Dzhanibekov effect]], also known as the [[unique_phenomena_in_zerogravity_settings_such_as_the_intermediate_axis_theorem | tennis racket theorem]] or [[unique_phenomena_in_zerogravity_settings_such_as_the_intermediate_axis_theorem | intermediate axis theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Discovery and Secrecy

In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov, while on a mission to rescue the disabled Salyut 7 [[exercising_and_maintaining_health_in_low_gravity_environments | space station]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, observed a strange phenomenon. After unpacking supplies, he noticed a wing-nut spinning off a bolt. The wing-nut maintained its orientation for a short period, then flipped 180 degrees, and continued to flip back and forth at regular intervals without any applied forces or torques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This counterintuitive behavior was kept secret by the Russians for ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Six years later, in 1991, a related phenomenon was described in a paper titled "The Twisting Tennis Racket," which made no mention of the secret Dzhanibekov effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Despite claims in the paper that the phenomenon seemed new and was not mentioned in general classical mechanics texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, the [[unique_phenomena_in_zerogravity_settings_such_as_the_intermediate_axis_theorem | intermediate axis theorem]] was described at least 150 years prior by [[historical_perspective_and_physics_behind_rotational_dynamics | Louis Poinsot]] in "The New Theory of Rotating Bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## The Intermediate Axis Theorem Explained

The [[unique_phenomena_in_zerogravity_settings_such_as_the_intermediate_axis_theorem | intermediate axis theorem]] applies to objects with three different moments of inertia about their three principal axes, known as an asymmetric top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Principal Axes and Moment of Inertia

A tennis racket provides a good illustration of the three principal axes of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:
*   **Axis 1 (Smallest Moment of Inertia):** Runs through the handle. Spinning around this axis is easiest and results in the fastest angular velocity for a given torque because the mass is distributed closest to this axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This spin is stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Axis 3 (Largest Moment of Inertia):** Runs perpendicular to the head of the racket. Spinning around this axis is slowest because the mass is distributed as far as possible from this axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This spin is also stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Axis 2 (Intermediate Moment of Inertia):** Runs parallel to the head of the racket. When rotating around this axis, an object will unpredictably make a half-twist or flip, a phenomenon that is virtually impossible to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

This effect is observed in various objects, including cell phones and a disc with a hole in it, even in a [[conducting_experiments_in_zero_gravity | zero g plane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Objects with spherical symmetry, like a spinning ring or a ball, have only one or two moments of inertia and will not demonstrate the [[unique_phenomena_in_zerogravity_settings_such_as_the_intermediate_axis_theorem | tennis racket theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Intuitive Explanation (Terry Tao's Model)

Mathematician Terry Tao provided an intuitive explanation for the [[unique_phenomena_in_zerogravity_settings_such_as_the_intermediate_axis_theorem | intermediate axis theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>:
1.  Imagine a thin, rigid, massless disc with heavy point masses on opposite edges of the x-axis and light point masses on opposite edges of the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
2.  This disc has three different moments of inertia: smallest around the x-axis (only light masses moving), largest around the z-axis (all four masses moving), and intermediate around the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
3.  When rotating perfectly around the y-axis, centrifugal forces on the big masses are balanced by centripetal forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
4.  If the disc is slightly bumped off its y-axis rotation, the small masses experience a centrifugal force proportional to their distance from the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
5.  Tension within the disc keeps the small masses orthogonal to the large masses. The large masses, due to their greater inertia, constrain the small masses to remain roughly in the y-z plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
6.  The centrifugal forces on the small masses accelerate them, increasing as they move further from the y-axis, until they flip to the opposite side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
7.  During the first half of the flip, centrifugal forces accelerate the masses; in the second half, they slow them down, bringing them to rest on the opposite side. This pattern then repeats indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Earth's Stability and Energy Dissipation

The Dzhanibekov effect gained media attention and conspiracy theories, especially around 2012, due to speculation that the Earth, as a spinning body in space, could also flip over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Cosmonaut Dzhanibekov himself attached modeling clay to the wing-nut to simulate a non-rigid body, and it too flipped periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The Russian federal space agency, RusCosmos, acknowledged a hypothesis among scientists that Earth could execute the same overturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

However, experiments by astronaut Don Pettit on the [[exercising_and_maintaining_health_in_low_gravity_environments | space station]] provide clues to Earth's stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. While a book or solid cylinder spins stably about its minimum or maximum moment of inertia axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, a liquid-filled cylinder spinning about its smallest moment of inertia axis will become unstable and eventually rotate about its largest moment of inertia axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

This occurs because, for an isolated object spinning in space, angular momentum remains constant, but kinetic energy can be converted into other forms, such as heat, through internal dissipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Spinning about the axis with the smallest moment of inertia corresponds to the greatest kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. As this energy dissipates, the body tends towards the state of minimum kinetic energy, which is achieved when rotating about the axis with the largest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

The U.S. learned this with their first satellite, Explorer One, which was designed to spin stably about its long axis but began rotating end-over-end within hours due to energy dissipation from its flexible antennas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

The Earth, like Explorer One, has internal mechanisms for dissipating energy. Therefore, over time, it has come to spin about the axis with its maximum moment of inertia, making its rotation stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Most astronomical objects, such as Mars (whose Tharsis Rise is at its equator to maximize moment of inertia) and asteroids, also spin about their maximum moment of inertia axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This ensures Earth's stability; it will not flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

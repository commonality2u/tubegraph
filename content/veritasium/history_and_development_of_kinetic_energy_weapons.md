Kinetic energy weapons, often colloquially known as "Rods from God," are hypothetical space-based weapons designed to deliver devastating impact purely through the [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] of a projectile, without the use of explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Origin and Concept

The idea for a space weapon emerged in the late 1950s, in response to the Soviet Union's advancements in space and missile technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. After the launch of Sputnik on October 4, 1957, and the successful test of the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of delivering a [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | nuclear warhead]] to the US East Coast in about 30 minutes, researcher Jerry Pournelle at Boeing conceived a space weapon concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Pournelle's idea was to place telephone pole-sized pieces of tungsten in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. These rods could be dropped on any target on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The weapon was envisioned to hit a target within 15 minutes of release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, destroy targets buried 30 meters underground (like Soviet nuke silos), and theoretically intercept ICBMs mid-flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

### Speed and Energy

Objects in orbit travel at around eight kilometers per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. While atmospheric drag would slow the rod upon re-entry, it would still impact at approximately Mach 10, or three kilometers per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

The [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] of an object is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This means increasing velocity by a factor of 10 increases [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] by a factor of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. A single 10-ton tungsten rod, without any explosives, would carry [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | energy]] equivalent to the MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast), also known as the Mother of All Bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, which released the equivalent of 11 tons of TNT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## Historical Projects and Names

*   **Project Thor**: Pournelle named his weapon concept Project Thor, after the Norse God known for throwing lightning bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Brilliant Pebbles**: In the 1980s, the kinetic missile interceptor idea was seriously considered by the Reagan administration under the codename Brilliant Pebbles, though the project was later abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Hypervelocity Rod Bundles**: The concept was resurrected in 2003 by the Air Force Transformation Plan, referring to it as hypervelocity rod bundles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Rods from God**: Colloquially, the weapon became known as Rods from God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of Kinetic Impacts

Kinetic impacts are inherently explosive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. For instance, the circular craters on the moon, regardless of the angle of asteroid impact, demonstrate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. Asteroids hit with such incredible speed that their [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] causes an explosion, heating the ground to liquid and gas, which then sprays outwards symmetrically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Similarly, Rods from God, hitting at Mach 10, would create an explosion equivalent to the largest conventional weapon ever launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

### Advantages of Kinetic Weapons

*   **Penetration**: Due to their speed, these rods could penetrate approximately 30 meters of soil, sufficient to bust bunkers or silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Precision**: The explosion is localized, allowing for precise "surgical strikes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.
*   **No Radioactive Fallout**: Unlike [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | nuclear weapons]], there is no radioactive fallout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.
*   **Legal Status**: There are no international laws or treaties prohibiting placing non-nuclear weapons in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

### Material and Shape

*   **Tungsten**: Tungsten is the preferred material for these rods for two main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>:
    *   **Density**: It is extremely dense, weighing 19 tons per cubic meter (over twice the density of steel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>. This means a given mass of tungsten can have a smaller volume, encountering less atmospheric resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Melting Point**: Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, at almost 3,500 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. This is crucial for re-entry, as it minimizes the need for shielding to prevent melting from heat buildup due to deceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.
*   **Aerodynamic Shape**: A sleek, aerodynamic rod shape is crucial to minimize drag and maintain maximum speed during re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

## Feasibility Challenges

Despite the theoretical advantages, Rods from God present significant practical challenges:

*   **[[difficulties_in_aiming_and_targeting_kinetic_projectiles | Aiming and Targeting]]**:
    *   Steering a rod at hypersonic speeds is incredibly difficult, even with potential thrusters, adjustable fins, or changes to the center of mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.
    *   Communicating with the rod from ground or space would be nearly impossible due to the superheated plasma surrounding it during re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.
    *   Even at lower altitudes (e.g., 500 meters), accurately hitting a target proved extremely difficult in experiments, with wind and swinging weights causing significant misses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.
*   **Orbital Mechanics and Time Delays**:
    *   Placing a rod in geostationary orbit (over 35,000 km away) would mean the rod takes several hours to fall to Earth, not minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.
    *   In low Earth orbit (around 350 km), the rod moves relative to the ground, completing a revolution every 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>. This could result in a strike taking up to an hour and a half from the time an order is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.
    *   To ensure a rod is always close to a target within a 15-minute window, hundreds of satellites would be required due to Earth's rotation and orbital drift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.
*   **Cost**:
    *   Launching a hundred 10-ton rods into space would cost billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.
    *   Ongoing maintenance costs would also be significant due to thruster breakdowns and malfunctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.
    *   A limited missile defense system against specific threats (e.g., North Korean ICBMs) would require around 400 rods spread across eight orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>. A global defense system would need even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>.
    *   A limited system has been estimated to cost around $300 billion, nearly half of the US military's annual budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.
*   **Counter-Measures**: Even with a costly system, enemies could evade defense by launching multiple missiles simultaneously, overwhelming the system as only one rod might be in the right location at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The practical difficulties in [[difficulties_in_aiming_and_targeting_kinetic_projectiles | aiming]], maintaining orbit, and the prohibitive costs make Rods from God unfeasible to execute in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. The weapon remains largely in the realm of science fiction, as explored by Jerry Pournelle himself, who became a science fiction writer after his time at Boeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>.

An invisible phenomenon that permeates the universe has been linked to inexplicable events, such as a plane plummeting out of the sky, a speedrunner jumping to a higher platform, and even an election recount being triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Early Investigations into Radiation

The concept of radiation originating from beyond Earth began to take shape through a series of experiments. After Henri Becquerel's [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics_discoveries | discovery of radioactivity]] with uranium in 1896, scientists began to seek ways to measure it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. One method involved a gold leaf electrometer, which discharges faster with higher levels of ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

In 1910, Theodore Wolf used an electrometer on the Eiffel Tower, expecting radiation to decrease significantly at 300 meters, but found only a slight reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Victor Hess and the Discovery of Cosmic Rays

Building on Wolf's work, Austrian physicist Victor Hess conducted balloon flights with electrometers in 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. His initial flights up to 1100 meters showed no significant change in radiation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. However, in seven subsequent flights up to 5,200 meters, Hess made a remarkable [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics_discoveries | discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>: while radiation initially dropped, it increased significantly with altitude above one kilometer, becoming several times greater than on the ground at his maximum height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This indicated the radiation was coming from the sky, not Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Hess also performed a flight during a solar eclipse, observing that the radiation readings were unaffected, suggesting it hardly emanated from the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Through these experiments, Victor Hess discovered [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]], high-energy radiation from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936 for this groundbreaking work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## The Nature and Origin of Cosmic Rays

Today, we know that [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]] are not electromagnetic rays but particles: approximately 90% protons, 9% helium nuclei, and 1% heavier nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. While some originate from the sun with low energy, high-energy [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]] come from exploding stars (supernovae) in our galaxy and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The highest energy particles are believed to emanate from black holes, including supermassive ones at galactic centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Pinpointing their exact origin is challenging because, as charged particles, they are deflected by magnetic fields in space, traversing the universe for billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

One notable example is the "OMG particle" detected on October 15, 1991, which was a single subatomic particle with an energy of 51 joules â€“ equivalent to a baseball going 100 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Primary [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]] do not reach Earth's surface directly. Instead, they collide with air molecules around 25 kilometers above ground, initiating a cascade of new particles like pions, neutrons, protons, muons, electrons, positrons, and photons, which then collide and decay further, forming a shower of particles streaming towards Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Visualizing and Identifying Cosmic Ray Particles

In 1911, Charles Wilson perfected his cloud chamber, an enclosure with supersaturated water or alcohol vapor, making it possible to "see" the paths of [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. When a [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic ray]] passes through, it ionizes the gas, causing vapor to condense into tiny droplets, revealing the particle's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

Using a cloud chamber in 1932, Carl Anderson identified a trail that resembled an electron's but curved in the opposite direction within a magnetic field, indicating a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This led to the [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics_discoveries | discovery of the anti-electron, or positron]], the first confirmed sighting of anti-matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Four years later, also using a cloud chamber, he discovered the muon, again in [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Anderson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936 with Victor Hess for his [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics_discoveries | discovery of the positron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Impact of Radiation on Electronics

Before [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]] were understood to cause issues, other forms of radiation were found to affect electronics. In the 1970s, as chip components were miniaturized, a single alpha particle could produce enough charge to flip a bit in a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

In 1978, Intel reported strange errors in their 16-kilobit dynamic random access memory (DRAM), where ones would spontaneously flip to zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The problem was traced to the ceramic packaging of the chip, which contained trace amounts of uranium and thorium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. These radioactive atoms were present because a manufacturing plant for semiconductor packaging was constructed downstream of an old uranium mill on the Green River in Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Alpha particles emitted by these elements were energetic enough to create electron-hole pairs in the silicon, leading to bit flips from one to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This phenomenon was termed a "single event upset" (SEU), a type of soft error where the device is not damaged, but the bit state changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

These findings garnered significant attention, leading chip manufacturers to be more careful in avoiding radioactive materials in microchip production and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Despite these measures, [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]] remain a cause of bit flips, such as the one that seemingly gave Maria Vindevogel 4,096 extra votes in a Belgian election recount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. It's estimated that for every 256 megabytes of RAM, one bit flip occurs per month, with neutrons from [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic ray]] showers being the main culprit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

[[impact_of_cosmic_rays_on_avionics_and_supercomputers | Cosmic rays have caused crashes of supercomputers]], particularly at higher elevations, such as at Los Alamos National Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. In avionics, at cruising altitude, the chance of a single event upset increases by 10 to 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. For instance, an Airbus A330 in 2008 experienced an incident where a bit flip in its air data inertial reference unit (ADIRU) mislabeled altitude information as angle of attack, causing the plane to pitch down sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. This incident highlighted the need for aerospace systems to be resilient to single event effects, a requirement that was not in place when the plane was built in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

In space, where [[cosmic_rays_and_their_effects_on_electronic_devices | cosmic rays]] are even more energetic, astronauts can sometimes see flashes of light with their eyes closed, believed to be heavy particles or energy bursts from radiation passing through the eyeball or optic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Protecting electronics in space is critical; for example, the computer on the Perseverance Rover is a 20-year-old Power PC launched in 2001, but it is radiation-hardened to withstand 40 times the radiation of an ordinary computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

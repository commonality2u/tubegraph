Carnot's ideal heat engine is considered one of the most important yet least understood concepts in [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It provided key insights into the fundamental limitations of converting heat into useful work.

## Historical Context

In 1813, Sadi Carnot, then a 17-year-old student, was inspired by the military conflicts affecting France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Seven years later, he visited his father, a general and physicist, who had written an essay on efficient energy transfer in mechanical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Their discussions focused on the latest breakthrough: steam engines, which were crucial for industrial and military might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. French steam engine designs were lagging behind those of countries like Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, prompting Carnot to investigate ways to improve their efficiency.

At the time, the best steam engines converted only about 3% of thermal energy into useful mechanical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Carnot aimed to improve this to give France a strategic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Description of Carnot's Ideal Heat Engine

Over three years, Carnot studied heat engines, leading to a key insight about how an ideal heat engine would function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This hypothetical engine operates without friction or energy losses to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

The engine setup involves:
*   Two large metal bars: one hot, one cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   A chamber filled with air, through which heat can only flow in or out through the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   A piston inside the chamber connected to a flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### The Four-Step Cycle

The cycle of an ideal Carnot engine proceeds as follows:
1.  **Isothermal Expansion (Heat In)**: The hot bar is brought into contact with the chamber. The air inside expands, pushing the piston up and turning the flywheel, while heat flows in to maintain its temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
2.  **Adiabatic Expansion**: The hot bar is removed. The air continues to expand, but without heat entering, its temperature decreases until it reaches the temperature of the cold bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
3.  **Isothermal Compression (Heat Out)**: The cold bar is brought into contact. The flywheel pushes the piston down, compressing the air, and heat is transferred into the cold bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
4.  **Adiabatic Compression**: The cold bar is removed. The flywheel compresses the gas further, increasing its temperature until it is just below that of the hot bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

The cycle then repeats, converting heat from the hot bar into the energy of the flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Reversibility

A crucial characteristic of Carnot's ideal engine is that it is completely [[counterintuitive_engineering_concepts | reversible]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. If the engine were run in reverse, everything would return to its original state without additional energy input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This means that running an ideal engine doesn't fundamentally change anything, as it can always be undone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Efficiency of Carnot's Ideal Heat Engine

Despite its reversibility, the efficiency of Carnot's ideal engine is not 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. In each cycle, the flywheel's energy increases by the heat flowing in from the hot bar minus the heat flowing out to the cold bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

The efficiency is calculated as:
```
Efficiency = (Heat Input from Hot Bar - Heat Output to Cold Bar) / Heat Input from Hot Bar
```
The heat input from the hot side is always greater than the heat output to the cold side because the hot gas exerts a greater pressure on the piston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. To increase efficiency, one could increase the hot side's temperature, decrease the cold side's temperature, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Absolute Zero and Kelvin Scale

Lord Kelvin recognized that Carnot's ideal heat engine could form the basis for an absolute temperature scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. He envisioned a scenario where gas expands so much that its particles effectively stop moving, exerting no pressure, and thus requiring no work to compress on the cold side, meaning no heat would be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This concept is absolute zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, and it would theoretically allow for a 100% efficient engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Using the Kelvin scale for absolute temperature, the efficiency formula can be expressed proportionally to the temperatures of the hot and cold sides:
```
Efficiency = 1 - (Temperature of Cold Side / Temperature of Hot Side)
```
The efficiency of an ideal heat engine fundamentally depends only on the temperatures of the hot and cold sides, not on the materials or design of the engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Achieving 100% efficiency would require an infinite temperature on the hot side or absolute zero on the cold side, both of which are practically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Even without friction or environmental losses, it's impossible to make a heat engine 100% efficient because heat must be dumped into the cold bar to return the piston to its original position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Real vs. Ideal Efficiency

In Carnot's time, high-pressure steam engines had a theoretical maximum efficiency of 32% (at 160 degrees Celsius), but their real efficiency was closer to 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This disparity arises because real engines experience:
*   Friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>
*   Dissipation of heat to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>
*   Non-constant temperature heat transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>

These factors mean that less energy ends up in the flywheel, and the rest is spread out over the engine's components and radiated into the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. When energy spreads out like this, it becomes impossible to retrieve, making the process irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. While the total amount of energy remains constant, its usability decreases. Energy is most usable when concentrated and least usable when spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Connection to Entropy

Decades after Carnot, German physicist Rudolf Clausius studied Carnot's engine and developed a way to quantify how spread out energy is, naming this quantity [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. When energy is concentrated in the hot bar, it represents low entropy. As energy spreads to the surroundings, entropy increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This means the same amount of energy is present, but in a more dispersed form, it is less available to do work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

In 1865, Clausius summarized the first two laws of thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>:
1.  The energy of the universe is constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
2.  The [[the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | entropy]] of the universe tends to a maximum, meaning energy spreads out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

The second law explains why hot things cool down, gases expand, and perpetual motion machines are impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, as the amount of usable energy in a closed system constantly decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. While often described as "disorder," entropy is best understood as the tendency of energy to spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This constant spreading out of energy is also what drives the arrow of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, eventually leading to the [[heat_death_of_the_universe | heat death of the universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

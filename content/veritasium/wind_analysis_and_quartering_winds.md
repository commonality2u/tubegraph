Understanding how wind interacts with tall structures is critical in structural engineering. The case of the Citicorp Center, now known as 601 Lexington, famously highlighted the often-overlooked significance of [[mechanics_of_wind_and_velocity | wind analysis]] from all directions, particularly "quartering winds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Traditional Wind Analysis

In a standard building with corner columns, wind hitting one side causes the entire frame to deform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. To counter this, diagonal bracing can be added, as beams and columns are stronger in compression or tension than bending loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. These braces carry the horizontal load, transferring forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

The concept of "building shear" dictates that the total force of wind increases as one goes down a building, meaning lower floors carry a much larger cumulative wind load than higher ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Structural engineers typically analyze wind pushing straight on a building, considering it the critical case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## The Challenge of Quartering Winds

Quartering winds are those that hit a corner of a building, rather than striking one of its faces perpendicularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. When analyzing these, the wind force is split into its perpendicular components on the adjacent faces, typically divided by the square root of two (F/√2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

In such a scenario, some diagonal stresses within a building's structure can vanish, while others can double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This phenomenon can lead to forces that are significantly higher—in the Citicorp Center's case, 40% higher—than what was calculated for a perpendicular wind load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### Dynamic Analysis

Initial calculations often assume static conditions, meaning the building is not moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. However, [[mechanics_of_wind_and_velocity | wind tunnel]] tests provide a dynamic analysis, which shows how forces change when the building is in motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. For the Citicorp Center, dynamic analysis revealed that stresses from quartering winds could increase up to 60% more than originally anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Impact on Citicorp Center

The Citicorp Center, an engineering marvel completed in 1977, was unique for its corner columns being placed at the center of each face to accommodate St. Peter's Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. To address this, structural engineer Bill LeMessurier designed a system of [[chevron_bracing_and_tuning_mass_dampers | chevron bracing]] to transfer gravity and wind loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The initial design assumed the [[chevron_bracing_and_tuning_mass_dampers | chevron braces]] would be fully welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. However, to save costs, bolts were used instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. LeMessurier's firm, like many at the time, only calculated for straight-on winds when determining the number of bolts needed for these connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Design Flaw
> When LeMessurier later re-evaluated the structure with quartering winds in mind, he found that some braces, particularly at the 30th floor, required around 10 bolts, not the 4 that were installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Further, his firm had used an incorrect factor of safety for minor structural elements, meaning they needed 14 bolts, not 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. This oversight, combined with the dynamic effects of wind, meant the building was vulnerable to collapse in winds of just 110 kilometers per hour if its [[chevron_bracing_and_tuning_mass_dampers | tuned mass damper]] failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The probability of a storm strong enough to cause collapse occurring in any given year was one in 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

The flaw was discovered in the summer of 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A secret repair plan, dubbed Project Serene, was implemented, involving welding two five-centimeter thick, two-meter long steel plates onto each of the more than 200 joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. The repairs were completed in October 1978, making the building capable of withstanding a one in 1000 year storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

## Legacy and Building Code Updates

The Citicorp Center incident, revealed publicly in 1995, led to significant changes in the engineering field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. New York City updated its building code to explicitly require calculations for quartering winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

LeMessurier's actions in disclosing and rectifying the flaw are widely taught as a case study in engineering ethics, emphasizing the responsibility of professionals beyond themselves when a social risk is identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

The general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein's "current best theory of gravity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, suggests the existence of not only [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]], but also [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | white holes]], parallel universes, and even a potential way to travel between them through wormholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Einstein's Theory of Gravity
Newtonian gravity, developed in the 1600s, struggled to explain how masses could exert force on each other over vast distances without mediation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, resolved this by proposing that a mass, such as the sun, curves the spacetime in its vicinity, and this curvature propagates, affecting other masses like Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Therefore, masses are affected by the local curvature of spacetime, eliminating the need for "action at a distance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

This curvature is described by Einstein's field equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. These equations relate the distribution of matter and energy to the resultant curvature of spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. They are a complex family of coupled, differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

### The Schwarzschild Solution and Singularities
Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial solution to Einstein's equations in 1915, describing how spacetime curves outside a single, eternal, static, spherically symmetric, and electrically neutral point mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. This solution, known as the Schwarzschild metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>, describes spacetime as nearly flat far from the mass but increasingly curved closer to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

However, the Schwarzschild solution presented two "problem spots" where the equations appeared to break down:
*   **Singularity at r=0**: At the center of the mass, the equations blow up to infinity, making it impossible to describe what is physically happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. This is a true singularity.
*   **Schwarzschild Radius**: At a specific distance from the center, known as the Schwarzschild radius, the equations also blow up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. At this radius, the escape velocity becomes the speed of light, meaning nothing, not even light, can escape from inside this region, forming a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

Initial skepticism about the existence of [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]] arose because their formation would require immense mass to collapse into a tiny space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Theoretical mechanisms like electron degeneracy pressure (forming white dwarfs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a> and neutron degeneracy pressure (forming neutron stars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a> were believed to prevent such a complete collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. However, it was later shown that neutron stars also have a maximum mass, and for the heaviest stars, collapse into a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

### The Coordinate System and Spacetime Maps
The apparent "singularity" at the event horizon of the Schwarzschild solution was a source of confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. This issue arises because the Schwarzschild solution uses a particular coordinate system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. By choosing a different coordinate system (a "coordinate substitution"), the singularity at the event horizon disappears, revealing that it is not a true physical singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.

Visualizing this, one can imagine space flowing towards the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] like a waterfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. Outside the event horizon, photons can "swim" against the flow and escape, albeit taking longer and becoming redshifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. At the horizon, space falls inward as fast as photons can travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. Inside the horizon, space falls faster than light, pulling everything into the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>. An outside observer would never see anything truly enter a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>, but an object crossing it would experience nothing unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.

Different projections of four-dimensional curved spacetime are used to understand its properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>:
*   **Light Cones**: Represent regions of spacetime that can be influenced (future light cone) or could have influenced (past light cone) a given event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Kruskal-Szekeres Diagram**: A projection where incoming and outgoing light rays always travel at 45 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>. In this diagram, the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] singularity transforms into a curved line, indicating it is a "moment in time" rather than a place in space for anything entering a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>.
*   **Penrose Diagram**: A type of Kruskal-Szekeres diagram that contracts the entire universe (infinite past, distance, and future) into a single finite map, while still showing light rays at 45 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.

## White Holes and Parallel Universes
The Penrose diagram for the Schwarzschild solution reveals new regions of spacetime:
*   **White Hole**: By tracing the past light cone from a point on the event horizon, a new region emerges where signals can be sent *out* to the universe, but nothing from the universe can ever enter it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. This is the opposite of a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], acting as a "time reverse picture" where things are expelled outwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. General relativity does not intrinsically dictate the direction of time flow, allowing for time-reversed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>.
*   **Parallel Universe**: The maximal extension of the Schwarzschild solution, pushing the Penrose diagram to its limits, reveals a second, "whole new universe" parallel to our own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>. This arises from the mathematical coordinates of the solution extending beyond what Schwarzschild initially described, akin to discovering the Southern Hemisphere from coordinates initially only covering the Northern Hemisphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:00">[25:33:00]</a>.
*   **Einstein-Rosen Bridge (Wormhole)**: The point where these two universes meet in the Penrose diagram is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>. This represents a theoretical connection between the space of both universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27:00">[27:27:00]</a>. However, these wormholes are not traversable; they "pinch off" too quickly for anything to travel through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>. In the Penrose diagram, there is no light cone that can take a traveler from one universe to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>.

## Rotating Black Holes and Extended Possibilities
All stars rotate, so any real [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] must also rotate due to the conservation of angular momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>. Solving Einstein's equations for a spinning mass proved much harder than for a static one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>. In 1963, Roy Kerr found the solution for a spinning [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], known as the Kerr solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>.

The Kerr solution presents several dramatic changes:
*   **Layered Structure**: The rotating [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] has multiple layers, including an ergosphere, outer horizon, and inner horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Spherical Symmetry**: Rotation causes the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] to bulge at the equator, making it symmetric only about its axis of spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.
*   **Space Dragging**: Space gets dragged around with the rotating [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>. Inside the ergosphere, space moves faster than the speed of light, making it impossible to remain still relative to distant stars, though escape is still possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.
*   **Inner Horizon**: Crossing the outer horizon leads to the point of no return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:39:00">[30:39:00]</a>. However, unlike a non-rotating [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], a traveler enters an inner region where they can move freely again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>.
*   **Ring Singularity**: The singularity in a rotating [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] expands from a point into a ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. It's theoretically possible to fly through this ring singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Universes/Anti-verses**: A Penrose diagram for a spinning [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] shows the singularity shifting to the sides, revealing new regions. Venturing further could lead to a white hole that expels the traveler into "a whole nother universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>. This suggests an infinite chain of universes connected by rotating [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]] and white holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:00">[32:05:00]</a>. Furthermore, flying through the ring singularity could lead to an "anti-verse" where gravity pushes instead of pulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>.

## Feasibility and Objections
While mathematically possible, these extended solutions for [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]], [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | white holes]], and wormholes face significant objections regarding their physical existence:
*   **Eternal Solutions**: Both the extended Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions describe *eternal* [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]] in empty universes, lacking a formation mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>. This is a major reason why [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]] are believed to exist in our universe, but [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | white holes]] are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>.
*   **Kerr Solution Instability**: The extended Kerr solution suggests that an infinite flux of energy could pile up along the inner horizon, creating its own singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:00">[34:31:00]</a>. This would seal off access to the ring singularity and the further universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>, making these second copies of universes impossible to reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.
*   **Traversable Wormholes and Exotic Matter**: In 1987, Michael Morris and Kip Thorne explored hypothetical wormholes that could be traversable, stable in time, and constructed by an advanced civilization for interstellar travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>. While allowed by general relativity, these geometries require "exotic matter" with a negative energy density to prevent the wormhole from collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>. Such matter is considered to be "really against the laws of physics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:00">[35:48:00]</a> and is not known to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>.

Based on current understanding, it seems unlikely that white holes, traversable wormholes, or these parallel universes exist in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>. However, just as [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]] were once considered too preposterous to be real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>, future discoveries could always lead to surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>.

Sunlight plays a critical role in the quality of open water reservoirs, particularly concerning the formation of harmful byproducts and the proliferation of algae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In Los Angeles, the presence of sunlight in the LA Reservoir led to significant water quality challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## The Bromate Problem

The primary issue stemmed from Bromide, a naturally occurring substance associated with saltwater intrusions in sources like the California Aqueduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Bromide itself is harmless and difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. However, when water is disinfected with Ozone, Bromide can convert into Bromate, which is carcinogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Regulations introduced around the year 2000 required treatment plants using Ozone to monitor Bromate formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Initially, Bromate levels at the filter plant were within the regulatory limit of 10 micrograms per liter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. However, an unexpected discovery arose when a beverage company customer reported high levels of Bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Tests revealed that Bromate levels jumped almost immediately upon water entering the open reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It was found that Bromide, when combined with Chlorine (which is necessary for disinfection), formed Bromate in bright sunlight, even more effectively than Ozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This was an unforeseen scientific discovery not covered by existing regulatory schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Faced with a water source containing Bromide and a need for Chlorine disinfection, the only viable solution was to eliminate sunlight from the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## The Shade Ball Solution

To address the sunlight problem, various options were considered, such as floating tarps or fields of chopped pipe, but these posed their own issues like becoming bird perches or creating a "Petri dish" environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The ultimate solution came in the form of [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | shade balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Initially called "bird balls," these products were previously used to deter waterfowl from ponds with mine tailings or near airports where birds could interfere with jet engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. After deployment in the LA Reservoir, all the birds were gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Testing and Design
Before full deployment, [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | shade balls]] were tested using three kiddie pools filled with reservoir water: one in sunlight, one with a tarp, and one with [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | shade balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The results showed that [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | shade balls]] immediately solved the Bromate problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

The [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | shade balls]] are black to block all light and prevent the Bromate reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. They are made of high-density polyethylene, a food-grade plastic, similar to milk jugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The black color comes from "carbon black," which makes the plastic stable and durable for at least 10 years when exposed to the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Other colors tested with unstable dyes could not guarantee longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The balls are inert and considered food-grade safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

Each ball is partially filled with water, which serves several purposes:
*   **Weight**: Prevents them from being blown away by high winds, preventing them from bouncing onto nearby freeways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Stability**: The uneven water distribution makes them wobble if they do start to roll, keeping them contained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Coverage**: The spherical shape is crucial because it allows them to spread out and cover the water completely as the reservoir levels fluctuate, preventing them from stacking up or sitting on the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

[[swimming_in_shade_balls | Driving a boat through the shade balls]] is difficult, described as being like driving through peanut butter, due to the density and stability they create on the water's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Additional Benefits of Sunlight Blockage

Beyond preventing Bromate, blocking sunlight with [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | shade balls]] provided other significant benefits:

*   **Algae Control**: Prior to the balls, large amounts of Chlorine were used to control algae growth, but outbreaks could still lead to a slight green tinge in tap water during summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. With sunlight gone, the algae problem disappeared, and chlorine addition to the reservoir became rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Reduced Evaporation**: Contrary to initial concerns that black balls would absorb more heat and increase evaporation, they actually reduce it by 80 to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This is due to several factors:
    *   [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | Shade balls]] reduce the exposed surface area of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   They limit air flow over the water's surface, preventing the removal of moist air and its replacement with dryer air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   While the top of the balls gets hot, the bottom remains cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   The balls are mostly filled with air, which acts as an excellent thermal insulator, preventing significant heat transfer to the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Measurements showed that the water under the [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | shade balls]] is actually cooler than exposed water, demonstrating a slight cooling effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Cost and Sustainability
The [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | shade balls]] cost around 33-34 cents apiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Over their lifespan, the savings from reduced chlorination and evaporation are expected to cover at least half of the cost of the balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Additionally, they are made of recyclable material, retaining some salvage value upon removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The water quality benefit, however, is considered immeasurable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

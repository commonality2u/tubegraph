Mathematics initially served practical purposes like land measurement, celestial prediction, and commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, a problem considered "impossible" emerged, requiring the separation of mathematics from the real world, algebra from geometry, and the invention of new numbers called imaginary numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Ironically, these [[development_of_complex_numbers | imaginary numbers]] later became central to fundamental physical theories of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Challenges with the Cubic Equation

In 1494, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, published "Summa de Arithmetica," a comprehensive summary of known mathematics in Renaissance Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This work included a section on the cubic equation (ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For at least 4,000 years, various ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Persians, attempted to find a general solution but were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Pacioli concluded that solving the cubic equation was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

This was surprising given that quadratic equations (without the x³ term) had been solved millennia earlier by many ancient civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The general solution for quadratics, -b ± √(b² - 4ac) / 2a, is commonly known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Geometric Derivation of Quadratic Solutions

Ancient mathematicians derived solutions geometrically rather than with equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. For example, to solve x² + 26x = 27:
*   x² was envisioned as a square with sides of length x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   26x was a rectangle with sides of length 26 and x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   These two areas sum to 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

To find x, the 26x rectangle could be cut in half to form two 13x rectangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. These could be positioned around the x² square to nearly form a larger square, missing only a 13x13 section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. By "completing the square" with a 13x13 square (area 169) on both sides of the equation, the equation becomes (x+13)² = 196 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Taking the square root, x+13 = 14, leading to x = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Limitations: The Problem of Negative Numbers

This geometric method was not complete because it could not account for negative solutions, such as x = -27 for x² + 26x = 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. For thousands of years, mathematicians ignored negative solutions because they dealt with real-world quantities like lengths and areas, where negative values made no sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This aversion led to six different versions of the quadratic equation, all arranged to keep coefficients positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Similarly, in the 11th century, Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam identified 19 different cubic equations, always with positive coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. He found numerical solutions for some through intersections of shapes like hyperbolas and circles, but could not achieve a general solution for the cubic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## The Italian Renaissance Breakthrough

### Scipione del Ferro and the Secret Solution

Around 1510, Scipione del Ferro, a mathematics professor at the University of Bologna, discovered a reliable method to solve "depressed cubics" (cubic equations without an x² term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In 16th-century Italy, mathematicians' jobs were often secured by their unique problem-solving abilities, leading to "math duels" where challengers would submit problems to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Del Ferro kept his solution secret for nearly two decades to ensure his job security, only revealing it to his student Antonio Fior on his deathbed in 1526 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### The Duel: Fior vs. Tartaglia

Fior, less talented but ambitious, boasted about his ability to solve depressed cubics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. On February 12, 1535, he challenged Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia, a self-taught mathematician known for his stutter (Tartaglia means "stutterer" in Italian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. In the duel, Fior presented Tartaglia with 30 depressed cubic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Fior couldn't solve a single problem from Tartaglia, while Tartaglia solved all 30 of Fior's problems in just two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Aware of Fior's claims and the possibility of a solution, Tartaglia had independently derived his own method for the depressed cubic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. He extended the concept of completing the square into three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For an equation like x³ + 9x = 26, he visualized x³ as a cube's volume and added volumes to reach 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. By a complex geometric rearrangement of additional volumes, he managed to transform the cubic into a quadratic in terms of y³ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This quadratic, y⁶ + 26y³ = 27, was familiar and led to y³ = 1, so y = 1, and eventually x = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Tartaglia summarized his method as an algorithm, which he recorded as a poem, as modern algebraic notation did not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Cardano's "Ars Magna" and the General Solution

Tartaglia's victory made him a celebrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Gerolamo Cardano, a polymath from Milan, persistently sought to learn Tartaglia's method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. After much flattery and aggressive letters, Cardano lured Tartaglia to Milan with the promise of an introduction to a wealthy benefactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. On March 25, 1539, Tartaglia revealed his method to Cardano, but only after extracting a solemn oath not to publish it or reveal it to anyone, and to write it only in cipher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Cardano, playing with Tartaglia's algorithm, discovered a way to solve the full cubic equation, including the x² term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. He found that substituting x - b/(3a) for x in any general cubic equation eliminated the x² term, converting it into a depressed cubic solvable by Tartaglia's formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Cardano, eager to publish his discovery, was bound by his oath to Tartaglia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. However, in 1542, he visited the son-in-law of Scipione del Ferro in Bologna, who shared del Ferro's old notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. In it, Cardano found del Ferro's solution to the depressed cubic, predating Tartaglia's by decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Believing this freed him from his oath, Cardano published "Ars Magna" (The Great Art) in 1545 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This compendium included a unique geometric proof for each of 13 arrangements of the cubic equation and acknowledged Tartaglia, del Ferro, and Fior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Tartaglia was greatly displeased, leading to a public feud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. To this day, the general solution to the cubic is often called Cardano's method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## The Emergence of [[development_of_complex_numbers | Imaginary Numbers]]

While writing "Ars Magna," Cardano encountered cubic equations, such as x³ = 15x + 4, that, when plugged into the algorithm, yielded solutions containing square roots of negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Cardano's geometric derivation of similar problems led to a paradox: a part of a square needing to have an area of 30, but also sides of length five, implying the need to add "negative area" to complete the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

Previously, square roots of negatives appeared in problems like finding two numbers that add to 10 and multiply to 40, which leads to a quadratic with negative square roots in its solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. For such problems, mathematicians understood that a negative square root indicated no real solution existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

However, the cubic equation x³ = 15x + 4 *did* have a real solution (x = 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Unable to reconcile the geometric paradox with the existence of a real solution, Cardano avoided this case in "Ars Magna," deeming the idea of square roots of negatives "as subtle as it is useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Bombelli's Breakthrough

Around 10 years later, Italian engineer Rafael Bombelli pursued this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Undeterred by the "impossible geometry," he posited that the square root of a negative "cannot be called either positive or negative" and allowed it to be its own new type of number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Bombelli assumed the terms in Cardano's solution could be combinations of ordinary numbers and this new type of number involving the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Through this, he found that the two cube roots in Cardano's equation were equivalent to 2 ± √(-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. When added together, the square roots cancelled out, leaving the correct answer of four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

This was a "miraculous" result: Cardano's method worked, but only by abandoning the geometric proof and allowing "negative areas" as intermediate, non-sensical steps in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

## Modern Mathematics and the Role of [[development_of_complex_numbers | Imaginary Numbers]]

Over the next century, modern mathematics took shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   In the 1600s, Francois Viete introduced modern symbolic notation for algebra, ending the ancient tradition of wordy and pictorial math problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Geometry ceased to be the sole source of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   Rene Descartes popularized the square roots of negatives, calling them "imaginary numbers," a name that endured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   Euler later introduced 'i' to represent the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   When combined with regular numbers, they form [[development_of_complex_numbers | complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

The cubic equation's solution led to the invention of these new numbers and freed algebra from its reliance on geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. By letting go of physically intuitive geometric descriptions, a more powerful and complete mathematics emerged, capable of solving real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## [[application_of_imaginary_numbers_in_physics | Application of Imaginary Numbers in Physics]]

The cubic was just the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. In 1925, Erwin Schrödinger, building on de Broglie's wave-particle duality, developed the Schrödinger equation, one of physics' most important equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Prominently featured within it was 'i', the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. While mathematicians were accustomed to [[development_of_complex_numbers | imaginary numbers]], physicists were uncomfortable with their appearance in a fundamental theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Schrödinger himself questioned the use of [[development_of_complex_numbers | complex numbers]], believing the wave function should be a real function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

The utility of [[development_of_complex_numbers | imaginary numbers]] in physics stems from their unique properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>:
*   They exist on a dimension perpendicular to the real number line, forming the [[development_of_complex_numbers | complex plane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   Multiplying by 'i' results in a 90-degree rotation in the [[development_of_complex_numbers | complex plane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   The function e^(ix) creates a spiral, whose real part is a cosine wave and whose imaginary part is a sine wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   These two quintessential wave functions are contained within e^(ix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.
*   Schrödinger naturally assumed solutions to his wave equation would look like e^(ikx - ωt) because its derivatives are proportional to the function itself, unlike sine or cosine functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   The linear nature of the Schrödinger equation allows for adding arbitrary numbers of these exponential solutions to form any wave shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

Physicist Freeman Dyson observed, "Schrödinger put the square root of minus one into the equation, and suddenly it made sense. Suddenly it became a wave equation instead of a heat conduction equation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The Schrödinger equation correctly describes atomic behavior and forms the basis of chemistry and most of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. The presence of the square root of minus one signifies that nature operates with [[development_of_complex_numbers | complex numbers]], not just real numbers, a discovery that surprised everyone, including Schrödinger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

[[development_of_complex_numbers | Imaginary numbers]], first discovered as a quirky intermediate step in solving the cubic, proved to be fundamental to our understanding of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. By moving beyond mathematics' direct connection to observable reality, a deeper truth about the universe was revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

Bowling is a sport that has been continuously reinvented for thousands of years, up to the present day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It is considered an ancient game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Ancient Origins

Archaeologists have discovered wall drawings in an ancient Egyptian tomb that depict a sport resembling bowling, dating back 7,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

In Germany, bowling was utilized as a religious ritual where pins symbolized sins; knocking them all down signified being a good Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Martin Luther, a known bowling enthusiast, is credited with standardizing the number of pins at nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Evolution in America

When the game arrived in America, nine-pin bowling faced a ban due to its association with gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. According to legend, 10-pin bowling was cleverly conceived to circumvent this law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Today in the U.S., nine-pin bowling is exclusively played in Texas, which opted to tax it instead of banning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Technological Advancements

### Lane Materials and Maintenance
Historically, bowling lanes were constructed from maple and pinewood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Modern lanes are predominantly synthetic, composed of fine particles coated with melamine resin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

The intentional application of oil to bowling lanes became a significant factor in the sport's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Initially, slip agents and lubricants, similar to car oil, were applied to protect the wood from wear and tear caused by bowling balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This practice was not originally intended for competitive scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. However, this oil layer allowed balls to skid rather than roll, leading to the development of the curved ball technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. As [[technological_advancements_in_bowling_equipment | technology advanced]], sophisticated [[impact_of_oil_patterns_on_bowling_lanes | lane machines]], costing around $30,000, were developed to apply precise amounts of oil on each board, creating varied oil patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Bowling Ball Development
The materials and internal structure of bowling balls have undergone substantial transformation:
*   **Hard Rubber** Bowling balls were common in the mid-1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Plastic Balls** An example is the Columbia Yellow Dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Urethane Bowling Balls** These became popular, with many titles won using this material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Reactive Resin Bowling Balls** Introduced around 1991, these are modified polyurethanes with a more porous surface, offering increased grip in the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. This is the most prevalent cover stock today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

Initially, bowling balls were perfect, symmetrically-weighted spheres, a characteristic still seen in "house balls" today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. The act of drilling finger holes removed weight from one side, leading manufacturers to add a small pancake weight on the same side for rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Later, the idea of incorporating different internal weights to enhance performance emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This led to the creation of [[manufacturing_process_of_bowling_balls | bowling balls]] with asymmetric cores, which appear identical from the outside but roll differently due to their internal weight distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. These advancements in ball technology, particularly regarding surface and internal weighting (RG and RG differential), significantly affect ball motion and the bowling game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

The introduction of new ball technologies has been correlated with increases in average scores and the number of perfect 300 games bowled per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. For example:
*   In 1976, the ban of "soaker balls" (chemically softened balls) caused a dip in perfect games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   The same year, the introduction of the Brunswick LT-48, a new rubber ball, led to more 300 games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
*   In 1991, the arrival of reactive resin balls marked another significant jump in perfect game frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

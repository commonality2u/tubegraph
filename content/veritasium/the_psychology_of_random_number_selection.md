People are generally poor at selecting things randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. When asked to pick a random color and a number, many people reliably choose blue and 7 across various cultures, a pattern known as the "blue-seven phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## The Case of 37

When asked to pick a random number between 1 and 100, the number 37 has long been suggested as the equivalent of the "blue-seven phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Initial testing by the video's creators, Derek and Emily, speaking to hundreds of people, found that 7 was the most common answer overall, possibly due to expectations of picking a number between 1 and 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, the most common two-digit number chosen was indeed 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Survey Results

While common belief and even magic tricks (like "The 37 Force") suggest 37 is reliably chosen, formal polls on this were rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The best prior finding was a Reddit poll of 1,380 people, where 69 was the most popular, followed by 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

To conduct a more extensive study, the video's creators ran the largest random number survey ever, gathering 200,000 responses from a community post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The results showed a consistent, non-random distribution of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Ignoring extreme values (1 and 100, which prime people) and non-random choices like 42 and 69, the numbers that stood out as being regarded as "more random" were 7, 73, 77, and 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

When people were asked to pick the number they thought the fewest others would pick (aiming for truly [[cultural_patterns_in_choosing_random_numbers | random selections]] by avoiding favorites or lucky numbers), 73 and 37 were overwhelmingly the most selected, nearly tied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Multiples of 10 (like 90, 30, 40, 70, 80, 60) were the least picked, as they do not "seem that random" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Why 37? Perceptions and Mathematics

The prevalence of 37 and 73 suggests they are not truly random choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Perceived Randomness
People tend to perceive even numbers as less random than odd numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Numbers like 5, 9, 1, and 50 are seen as "too extreme" or "too central," leading people to favor digits like 3 and 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Indeed, 3 and 7 were the most selected digits in the survey questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Mathematical Significance
There is also a mathematical basis for 37's prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>:

*   **Prime Numbers**: Primes, particularly, feel like the most random numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   They appear less frequently in daily life compared to composite numbers (e.g., in pixel counts, fruit boxes, square footage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   There is no simple formula to find the next prime number, implying they "essentially occur at random" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This relates to [[mathematical_uniqueness_of_prime_numbers | mathematical uniqueness of prime numbers]].
*   **Median Second Prime Factor**: For all integers, the median second prime factor is 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This means half of all numbers have a second prime factor of 37 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Other Qualities**: 37 is an irregular prime, Cuban prime, lucky prime, sexy prime, permutable prime, and a Padovan prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

> [!INFO] Childhood Fascination with 37
> The video's creator, Derek, learned that 37 was a prime number from a childhood book that described 37 as simply "a prime number" and "nothing goes into it," stating, "Someday, you'll understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This lack of explanation for 37 compared to other numbers (e.g., 26 letters in the alphabet, 30 days in September, 52 cards in a deck) intrigued him for 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## The 37% Rule in Decision Making

Beyond perception and pure mathematics, 37 holds practical importance in human decision-making, particularly in scenarios where options are encountered sequentially and decisions are immediate and final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This is known as the secretary problem or the marriage problem, applicable to hiring, renting, or even choosing a life partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] The 37% Rule
> To maximize the chance of picking the best option in such scenarios, the optimal strategy is to explore and automatically reject the first 37% of the options to gather information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. After this initial exploration phase, one should then select the first option that is better than all previous options seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Using this method, the chance of success is approximately 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This is a core concept in [[the_application_of_the_37_rule_in_decision_making | decision making]] and [[probability_theory_in_problem_solving | probability theory in problem solving]].

> The rule can also apply to time; for example, if one plans to marry in 10 years, the first 3.7 years should be spent exploring options before selecting the next person who is better than anyone previously encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

This suggests that people may subconsciously gravitate towards 37 because it "feels right" for making decisions, recognizing its ideal balance for settling and picking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Cultural Recognition and Collection

The number 37 appears widely in various contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. A man has been collecting instances of 37 since 1981, inspired by a comedy routine by Charles Fleischer, who highlighted "amazing coincidences" such as 37 holes in a telephone speaker, 37 Shakespeare plays, and 37 movements in Beethoven's Nine Symphonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

He started a website dedicated to 37 in 1994 and receives contributions from a "tireless cabal of 37 people" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. His collection includes diverse examples like 37 grams on a granola bar, a 37-inch yardstick, Jersey number 37, a nail with 37 on its head, $37 birthday money, serial numbers containing 37, a $37 million lottery, the 37th Mersenne prime, and 37 steps in a university bookstore staircase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. His interest extends to 37 represented in other bases, such as binary (100101), hexadecimal (25), and octal (45) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

The widespread subconscious recognition of 37 highlights its significance as humanity's go-to random number, a prominent prime number, and an ideal number for making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. This suggests that intuition, influenced by such unseen patterns, is a powerful tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

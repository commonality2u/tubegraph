Cosmic rays, an invisible phenomenon that permeates the universe, can inexplicably impact electronic devices, leading to errors and malfunctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. These high-energy particles can cause "bit flips" in computer memory, altering data and potentially leading to significant consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## How Cosmic Rays Affect Electronics: Bit Flips

Computers operate using binary code, where data is stored as strings of zeros and ones, each representing a power of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. A "bit flip" occurs when a bit spontaneously changes from a zero to a one, or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This can happen when a high-energy particle, such as a cosmic ray, strikes a transistor or memory cell within an electronic circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

### Single Event Upsets (SEU)
A bit flip is a type of "single event upset" (SEU), also known as a soft error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. This means the device itself isn't damaged, but the data has changed, and it can be erased and rewritten without issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. The problem of spontaneous bit flips became apparent to large computer companies starting in the 1970s, as chip components were miniaturized to the point where a single particle could produce enough charge to flip a bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Belgian Election Error (2003)
On May 18, 2003, during a Belgian election that used computer-based voting, a candidate named Maria Vindevogel received 4,096 more votes than mathematically possible in the municipality of Schaerbeek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. After extensive tests on both software and hardware failed to replicate the error, investigators concluded that the 13th bit in the vote tally, representing 2^12 or 4,096, had flipped from a zero to a one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This was strongly suspected to be caused by a cosmic ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

#### Precedent: Intel DRAM Errors (1978)
Earlier, in 1978, Intel reported similar "strange errors" in their 16-kilobit dynamic random access memory (DRAM), where ones would spontaneously flip to zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The cause was traced to the ceramic packaging of the chip, which contained trace amounts of uranium and thorium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. These [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | radioactive materials]] emitted alpha particles, which are energetic enough to create electron-hole pairs in silicon, causing electrons to accumulate and flip a bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. As a result, chip manufacturers became more careful to avoid [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | radioactive materials]] in their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. However, the Belgian election error was not caused by natural [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | radioactivity]] within the computer itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

## Origin of Cosmic Rays

### Discovery of Cosmic Rays
[[historical_discoveries_about_cosmic_rays | Cosmic rays]] were discovered by Austrian physicist Victor Hess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. In 1910, Theodore Wolf took an electrometer to the top of the Eiffel Tower, expecting less radiation at 300 meters, but found only a slight decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Inspired by this, Hess conducted balloon flights up to 5,200 meters between 1911 and 1912 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. He observed that while radiation initially dropped, above one kilometer, it significantly increased with altitude, indicating it came from the sky, not Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. A flight during a solar eclipse showed no influence on the radiation, suggesting it did not emanate from the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

### Composition and Sources
Today, it is known that cosmic rays are not [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electromagnetic waves]] but high-energy particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. Approximately 90% are protons, 9% are helium nuclei, and 1% are heavier nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   **Low-energy cosmic rays** primarily originate from the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   **High-energy cosmic rays** moving near the speed of light come from exploding stars (supernovae) within our own galaxy and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   The **highest-energy particles** are thought to originate from black holes, including supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

Because they are charged particles, cosmic rays are deflected by magnetic fields in space, making it difficult to pinpoint their exact origin as they can wind through the universe for billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. One notable event was the "OMG particle" detected on October 15, 1991, which was a single subatomic particle with the energy of a baseball going 100 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

### Cosmic Ray Showers
Primary cosmic rays rarely reach Earth's surface directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. Instead, they collide with air molecules about 25 kilometers above the ground, creating a cascade of new particles like pions, which then decay into neutrons, protons, muons, electrons, positrons, and photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. This results in a "shower" of secondary particles streaming towards the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. Neutrons from these showers are considered the main culprits for bit flips in electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

## Visible Effects on Electronics and Systems

### Video Games
In 2013, a speedrunner playing Super Mario 64 experienced an "up warp" onto a higher platform that shaved off seconds from his run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. This glitch could not be replicated, and the best explanation is that a cosmic ray caused a bit flip in Mario's height coordinate, coincidentally aligning him with the higher floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

### Common Computer Errors
Cosmic ray-triggered bit flips happen all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. An entire process can hang, leading to errors like the "blue screen of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. IBM estimated in 1996 that one bit flip occurs per month for every 256 megabytes of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

### [[impact_of_cosmic_rays_on_avionics_and_supercomputers | Supercomputer Crashes]]
[[impact_of_cosmic_rays_on_avionics_and_supercomputers | Supercomputers]], particularly those at higher elevations, are vulnerable to cosmic ray-induced crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Los Alamos National Labs, located at 2,200 meters above sea level, frequently deals with neutron-induced supercomputer crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. To counter this, their software frequently auto-saves, and neutron detectors are installed throughout the facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.

### [[impact_of_cosmic_rays_on_avionics_and_supercomputers | Avionics in Aircraft]]
At cruising altitudes in planes, [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] from cosmic rays increases significantly, raising the chance of a single event upset by 10 to 30 times compared to ground level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.

*   **Qantas Flight 72 Incident (2008)**: On October 7, 2008, an Airbus A330 en route from Singapore to Perth suddenly pitched down twice, injuring 119 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. The investigation concluded that a bit flip in the first air data inertial reference unit (ADIRU) mislabeled altitude information as angle-of-attack data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. This caused the plane to incorrectly react to what it perceived as a stall, leading to sharp dives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. A single event effect from a high-energy atmospheric particle was deemed the most likely cause, as the Airbus A330, built in 1992, had no specific regulatory requirements for resilience to such events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.

## Mitigation and [[radiation_hardening_in_space_missions_and_electronics | Radiation Hardening]]

To protect critical electronic systems from cosmic ray effects:

*   **Error Correction Code (ECC) Memory**: Modern computer chips are designed to be more resilient, often using ECC memory which can detect and correct many common memory errors, including those caused by single bit flips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.
*   **Redundancy**: In systems where failure is catastrophic, multiple identical computers run in parallel. For example, the Space Shuttle had four computers simultaneously running identical software for navigation and control. If one computer had a soft error, the other three would overrule it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. On one five-day mission (STS 48), 161 separate bit flips were tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.
*   **[[radiation_hardening_in_space_missions_and_electronics | Radiation Hardening]]**: For space missions where [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] levels are much higher, electronics undergo [[radiation_hardening_in_space_missions_and_electronics | radiation hardening]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>. This involves specialized design, materials, circuits, and software built to withstand significantly more radiation (e.g., 40 times that of an ordinary computer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>. The computer on the Perseverance Rover that landed on Mars uses a 20-year-old PowerPC chip that is [[radiation_hardening_in_space_missions_and_electronics | radiation hardened]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>. Testing for [[radiation_hardening_in_space_missions_and_electronics | radiation hardening]] involves exposing operating system processors to particle beams to induce "blue screens of death" and analyze the failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.

## Cosmic Rays in the Universe

The heliosphere, a protective bubble formed by particles streaming from the sun and the solar wind, helps deflect and slow cosmic rays from interstellar space, shielding the solar system from [[types_and_effects_of_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>. The sun's 11-year activity cycle causes this protection to fluctuate, resulting in a lower flux of cosmic rays on Earth when the sun is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>.

Beyond their effect on electronics, cosmic rays may have played a role in Earth's history by "flipping bits" in the genetic codes of living organisms, providing some of the variation upon which natural selection acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>.

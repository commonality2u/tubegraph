[[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | Fluid dynamics]] often involves understanding the behavior of fluids, which can exhibit two primary flow regimes: [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] and turbulent flow. [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | Laminar flow]] is characterized by fluid particles moving parallel to each other in organized layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. In contrast, [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] is a chaotic and unpredictable phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, comprising many interacting swirls of fluid known as eddies or vortices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Osborne Reynolds' Experiment and the Discovery of Transition

The transition from [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] to [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] was experimentally demonstrated by Osborne Reynolds in 1883 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. He conducted an experiment where water flowed through a glass pipe, introducing a stream of dye to visualize the flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Reynolds observed:
*   At low flow rates, the dye remained in a steady, [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar stream]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   As the flow rate increased, the dye began to oscillate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Beyond a certain critical point, the dye became completely diffused throughout the pipe, indicating [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

This diffusion characteristic is another key aspect of turbulence, as it effectively mixes substances like dye, heat, or momentum throughout the fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## The Reynolds Number

Reynolds found that the transition to [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] depended not only on the flow rate but also on the pipe's width and the fluid's viscosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. He formulated a dimensionless quantity, now known as the **Reynolds number**, to predict this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

The Reynolds number is calculated as:
$$Re = \frac{Velocity \times Characteristic \ Length}{Kinematic \ Viscosity}$$
where:
*   **Velocity** refers to the fluid's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Characteristic Length** is a relevant dimension of the flow, such as the diameter of a pipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Kinematic Viscosity** measures the fluid's internal friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

*   **High Reynolds numbers** typically result in [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Low Reynolds numbers** correspond to [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, meaning it occurs at low speeds, small sizes, or with viscous fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Prevalence of Turbulent Flow

In everyday life, most fluid flow is [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] because conditions often lead to high Reynolds numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This includes:
*   Air flowing in and out of human lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   Blood pumping through the aorta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   The Earth's atmosphere near the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Air flow in and around cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   [[applications_of_turbulent_flow_in_technology_and_nature | Turbulent flow]] is also essential for the formation of raindrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Boundary Layers and Drag

When a fluid flows over a surface, a **boundary layer** forms, which is a region where the fluid's velocity adjusts from zero at the surface (due to friction and adhesion) to the free-stream velocity further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This interaction creates a force on the surface known as **skin friction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

If the fluid velocity is fast or the surface is long, the boundary layer will grow and eventually transition to [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. In a [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent boundary layer]], the fluid swirls and mixes, bringing faster-flowing fluid closer to the surface, which significantly increases skin friction and overall drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Applications in Design and Technology

Understanding and manipulating the Reynolds number and its effect on boundary layers is crucial in many engineering applications:

*   **Aircraft**: The boundary layers around planes are mostly [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]], and skin friction accounts for the majority of drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Smooth, clean surfaces can reduce drag and save fuel costs by preventing premature [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
    *   However, sometimes [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] is intentionally induced. For example, vortex generators on wings cause [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] to mix faster-flowing air down closer to the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This "energizes" the fluid flow, allowing it to remain attached to the wing for longer, delaying flow separation and stall, and thus maintaining lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

*   **Golf Balls**: Smooth golf balls would not fly as far as dimpled ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. While a smooth ball has low skin friction, its [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar boundary layer]] separates easily, creating a large wake of low-pressure [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent air]] behind it, leading to significant pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Dimples on a golf ball force the boundary layer to become [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. A [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent boundary layer]] adheres longer to the ball's surface before separating, reducing the size of the wake and thereby decreasing pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This reduction in pressure drag outweighs the increased skin friction, allowing the golf ball to travel further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The drag coefficient can drop by almost a factor of two when the boundary layer becomes [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Turbulent Wakes and Harnessing Energy

Even [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent wakes]] are of interest to scientists seeking to harness the energy they contain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. A phenomenon known as periodic vortex shedding, where vortices are shed alternately from an object, creates a predictable pattern downstream called a von Karman Vortex Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. While not strictly [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] due to its predictability, it is part of the transition to [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Experiments have shown that fish can use the energy in these vortex structures to swim more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

In summary, the Reynolds number provides a critical framework for understanding and predicting fluid behavior, bridging the gap between [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar]] and [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] regimes, which has widespread [[applications_of_turbulent_flow_in_technology_and_nature | applications in technology and nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

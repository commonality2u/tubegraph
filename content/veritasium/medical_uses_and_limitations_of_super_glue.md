## Introduction
Super glue, or cyanoacrylate, is a powerful adhesive known for its rapid bonding and immense strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A single drop can hold over three tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While widely used in industrial and household applications, it also has significant medical uses and limitations due to its unique chemical properties.

## Accidental Medical Discovery
The medical potential of super glue was discovered by chemist Harry Coover, who had previously dismissed it as a "severe pain" due to its stickiness during early development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Years later, in 1951, while still working with cyanoacrylate, Coover had an insight when his coworker Fred Joyner accidentally glued two prisms together with it, ruining a refractometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Coover realized its instant, strong bonding could be a benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

The direct inspiration for its medical use came when Coover's eldest son cut his finger while building a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:03">[16:01:03]</a>. Coover applied some super glue from his lab to the cut, and it instantly sealed it shut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:06">[16:06:06]</a>. Coover immediately saw its potential to replace sutures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:22">[16:18:22]</a>.

## How Super Glue Bonds to Skin
Super glue, in liquid form, consists of identical monomer molecules called ethyl cyanoacrylate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. When applied, these monomers flow into pores and crevices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:07">[03:06:07]</a>. The polymerization of super glue is triggered by water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:28">[06:25:28]</a>, specifically the slightly negative oxygen atoms and negative hydroxide ions in water molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. These ions break open the carbon double bond in the monomer, initiating the formation of long polymer chains, which solidifies the glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

Skin is an ideal surface for super glue to stick to because it has many wrinkles and pores for the glue to seep into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. Additionally, the protein collagen in skin has negative regions that can initiate the polymerization reaction and bond directly with a monomer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. This means some of your molecules literally become part of the polymer chain, making it very difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

## Limitations of Standard Super Glue for Medical Use
Despite its sticking power, Coover and his team faced three key problems when trying to develop super glue for medical purposes:

1.  **Heat Release** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:27">[16:25:27]</a>: As super glue sets, the formation of new chemical bonds releases heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. On skin, this temperature increase is enough to irritate a wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. A cotton ball, which has a lot of surface area and absorbs water, can heat up to 120 degrees Celsius when liquid super glue is applied, even smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Toxicity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:21">[17:15:21]</a>: Over time, standard super glue in the body breaks down into toxic chemicals, such as formaldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.
3.  **Brittleness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:29">[17:25:29]</a>: Super glue is hard and brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Since living tissue is soft and flexible, an adhesive for it needs to be able to flex without breaking throughout the healing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>. The rapid polymerization of super glue typically produces short polymer chains with built-in stress, making them prone to fracturing upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

## Solving the Medical Limitations
Remarkably, Coover and his team found that all these problems could be solved by a single modification to the molecule: increasing the number of carbons in the alkyl chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>.

*   **Slower Reaction Rate:** Longer carbon chains increase the time it takes for monomers to bind, slowing down the reaction rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:56">[17:53:56]</a>. This prevents a significant, sudden temperature increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Toxicity:** The longer polymers break down much more slowly, giving the wound enough time to heal before toxins are released into the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:09">[18:06:09]</a>. The glue is typically removed before this happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Flexibility:** A slower reaction rate allows more time for monomers to form longer polymers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>. These longer polymers are more flexible and can absorb stress better than shorter chains, allowing the glue to flex without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>.

## Military and Civilian Applications
The US military quickly became interested in Coover's modified adhesive. They developed a medical super glue spray for use in the Vietnam War, which saved lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:44">[18:41:44]</a>. In one notable case, a 24-year-old soldier with severe kidney and liver injuries, who had lost a large amount of blood, was saved when surgeons sprayed super glue directly onto his liver to stop the bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>.

Despite its battlefield success, bureaucratic hurdles delayed civilian approval for years, leading Coover to abandon the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. However, his dream was eventually realized in 1998 with the approval of Dermabond, a 2-octyl cyanoacrylate medical adhesive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:32">[19:29:32]</a>. Today, medical super glue is a $900-million-a-year industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:40">[19:38:40]</a>.

## Dangers and Removal from Skin
While medical super glue is safe when properly formulated and applied, standard super glue poses risks if it comes into contact with the body.

*   **Rapid Setting in Mouth/Eyes:** Saliva, being water-based, can cause super glue to harden almost immediately upon contact, as demonstrated when a person accidentally got super glue in their mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Similarly, attempts to wash super glue off hands with soap and water can accelerate polymerization, sticking hands together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   **Eyes:** Hundreds of cases exist where people have accidentally put super glue into their eyes due to bottles resembling eyedrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.
*   **Removal:** For skin, acetone (found in nail polish remover) can dissolve the glue and release stuck parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:08">[08:06:08]</a>. However, acetone should **not** be used for eye exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. In cases of eye contact, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention rather than attempting to separate eyelids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

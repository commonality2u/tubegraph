Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, has found significant utility in modern [[engineering_applications_of_origami | engineering applications]] due to its underlying mathematical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Engineers are leveraging origami for diverse purposes, including medical devices, space applications, and even bulletproof materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Evolution of Designs through Mathematics
The number of documented origami designs has expanded dramatically, from a few hundred around 400 years ago to tens of thousands today, largely due to advancements in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This explosion in creativity was inspired by masters like Akira Yoshizawa, who created thousands of new designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The ability to systematically design complex shapes, such as a cactus with multiple spines, which took seven years to develop, highlights the intricate challenges and the need for a systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Why Origami is Useful for Engineering
The primary reason origami is so useful in engineering is its ability to transform a flat sheet into a complex three-dimensional shape with minimal processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This transformation can result in significant size reduction, as demonstrated by a one-meter square of paper folding down into a small cactus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Additionally, the simple act of folding a material can intrinsically increase its rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Mathematical Methods in Origami Design
Designing functional origami for [[engineering_applications_of_origami | engineering applications]] relies heavily on mathematical methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The speaker, with a professional background in mathematics and physics, found that origami was amenable to the same mathematical approach used to describe lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### Crease Patterns
At the core of origami mathematics is the concept of a "crease pattern," which is a plan for how to fold a specific design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### Circle Packing Method
For designs that can be represented as a "stick figure" (e.g., a scorpion with claws, legs, and a tail), the "circle packing method" is a powerful mathematical tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
1.  **Representation**: Each feature of the desired shape (e.g., claw, leg, tail) is abstractly represented by a circular region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
2.  **Arrangement**: These circles are then "packed" or arranged onto the square of paper, similar to packing balls into a box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
3.  **Skeleton**: The arrangement of these circles forms the "skeleton" of the crease pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
4.  **Construction**: Following systematic geometric rules, lines are added between the centers of every pair of circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. If two lines form a "V," a "ridge fold" is added halfway between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This step-by-step process, based on geometric patterns, constructs all the necessary fold lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
5.  **Result**: Once complete, the circles, which served as "scaffolding," are removed, leaving the precise pattern of folds needed to create the desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

This systematic process revolutionized [[history_and_evolution_of_origami_designs | origami design]], ensuring the fold pattern precisely yielded the intended shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Origamizer Algorithm
For objects that are more like a surface (e.g., a sphere or a blobby animal body) rather than a stick figure, different algorithms are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Approximately ten years ago, Japanese mathematician Tomohiro Tachi developed an algorithm called "Origamizer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. This algorithm takes a triangulated surface as a mathematical description and generates the folding pattern to create that surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

## Scalability and Miniaturization
Mathematical principles enable the scaling and miniaturization of origami-inspired devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This has led to the creation of the world's smallest origami flapping bird, which is smaller than a grain of salt and less than a millimeter square when unfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. While a microscopic flapping bird itself has no direct use, the techniques developed for creating microscopic self-folding origami have applications in [[origami_in_medical_and_technological_devices | microscopic medical devices]] and implants, such as a nano-injector for gene therapy that is only four micrometers thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, origami is useful in [[engineering_applications_of_origami | engineering]] because it offers a method to transform a flat sheet of material into almost any shape through folding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. It can also reduce the dimensions of flat products while ensuring easy deployment and can increase material rigidity through folding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The flexibility of materials can be exploited to create specific motions, and its principles are scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Translating these ideas into practical engineering solutions necessitates extensive mathematical modeling and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

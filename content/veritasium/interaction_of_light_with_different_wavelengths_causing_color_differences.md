Light is understood to be brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> and makes a room not dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The difference between colors like blue light and red light is simply the color itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Light enters the eyes, allowing us to see things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The spectrum of light ranges from white to red, orange, and green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Historical Understanding of Light
For centuries, the question of "what is light?" was a complex issue debated by scientific minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton proposed that light consisted of a stream of particles, or corpuscles, in his treatise *Opticks* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, simultaneously, Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens suggested that light behaved as a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This [[historical_debate_on_the_nature_of_light | debate over the nature of light]] continued until it was largely settled by [[nature_of_light_particles_versus_waves | Thomas Young's double-slit experiment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## The Double-Slit Experiment and Color
Thomas Young's double-slit experiment, recreated using sunlight, provides key insights into the [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | nature of light]] and how colors are formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. In this experiment, sunlight passes through two very narrow, side-by-side openings, or slits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Most people might expect to see two lines or bright spots on the bottom of a box when light passes through two slits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, the observed pattern is much more complex, featuring multiple bright spots, often described as dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Crucially, these dots often display a [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | rainbow]] effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The central bright spot typically appears white, while the spots further from the center show multiple colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Wavelengths and Interference
The presence of these colored fringes is a direct consequence of light behaving as a wave. If light were purely particles, two bright spots would be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. However, as waves, the light from one slit interacts with the light from the other slit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

This interaction is known as [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | interference]]:
*   **Constructive Interference**: Occurs when peaks of one wave align with peaks of another, or troughs with troughs, increasing the wave's amplitude and producing a bright spot of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Destructive Interference**: Occurs when a peak from one wave meets a trough from another, resulting in cancellation and no light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### How Different Wavelengths Create Color
The "rainbowing effects" observed in the experiment are due to sunlight being composed of many different colors, each possessing a different wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Because different wavelengths meet up at slightly different points when they interfere, they produce the colored fringes seen further from the central bright spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For example, reds interfere constructively at different locations than blues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

This phenomenon confirms that what we perceive as color is simply a difference in the wavelength of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Therefore, seeing a red bin or a green pot means that different wavelengths of light are reaching our eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This principle is fundamental to how we perceive the beautiful colors in our environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Initially, the results of Young's double-slit experiment were so convincing that the scientific community concluded light must be a wave, and not a particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## The Problem with Non-Flushable Wipes
The issue of wipes backing up sewer systems is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. One personal account describes how the main sewer for a building backed up into a condo, flooding the entire downstairs, because a neighbor had flushed baby wipes down the toilet, blocking the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Statistical Insights
Studies highlight the scale of this problem:
*   In 2016, a study found that 60 million baby wipes are purchased in the US annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   Of these, seven million baby wipes are flushed down toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   An examination of the New York City sewer system revealed that 38% of the material found there consisted of baby wipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   In contrast, while 14 million flushable wipes are purchased and flushed each year, they account for only 2% of what is found in sewer systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

It is crucial that anything disposed of in a toilet is capable of breaking apart to prevent clogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Testing Flushability
An experiment was conducted to demonstrate the difference in breakdown rates between various wipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. A baby wipe, a paper towel, and a "flushable" wipe (Cottonelle brand) were submerged in a fish tank for 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. After 30 minutes, their strength was tested using a roll of pennies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

| Wipe Type           | Result                                                              |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Baby Wipe           | Still supported the weight of the pennies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. |
| Paper Towel         | Still supported the weight of the pennies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. |
| Cottonelle Flushable Wipe | The pennies fell through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.                        |

This experiment illustrates that true "flushable" wipes are designed to immediately begin breaking down after flushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

Johannes Kepler was a prominent scientist who lived and worked in Prague, Czech Republic, over 400 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. His work laid foundational elements for understanding the universe, spanning both astronomy and geometry.

## Planetary Models and Orbits

Kepler is most renowned for discovering that planetary orbits are ellipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, before this realization, he developed an earlier model of the solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. In this model, planets were positioned on nested spheres, which were separated by the Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Platonic solids are geometric objects where all faces and all vertices are identical, allowing for rotational symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The five Platonic solids are:
*   Cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Tetrahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Dodecahedron (12 pentagonal sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Icosahedron (20 sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

At the time, only six planets were known, which conveniently allowed Kepler to place a unique Platonic solid as a "spacer" between each of the planetary spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. He meticulously arranged the solids to align the planetary distances with astronomical observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This approach stemmed from his profound conviction in the universe's inherent geometric regularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Sphere Packing and Kepler's Conjecture

Kepler's interest in geometry extended to practical problems, such as efficiently stacking cannonballs on a ship's deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. By 1611, he proposed that hexagonal close packing and the face-centered cubic arrangement were the most efficient ways to stack spheres, achieving approximately 74% volume occupancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Although this method appears intuitive (as seen in how oranges are stacked in supermarkets), Kepler merely stated it as a fact without a formal proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This statement became known as [[keplers_conjecture_and_the_stacking_efficiency_of_spheres | Kepler's Conjecture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. It took nearly 400 years for a formal proof to be published, finally appearing in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Snowflakes and Early Ideas of Crystallography

Kepler published his conjecture in a pamphlet titled *Deniva Sexangula*, or *On the Six-Cornered Snowflake* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. In this work, he pondered why snowflakes invariably exhibit a six-cornered shape rather than five or seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

At the time, a comprehensive theory of atoms, molecules, or their self-arrangement into crystals did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. However, Kepler was on the cusp of such understanding, speculating about the "smallest natural unit" of water (essentially a water molecule) and how these tiny units could mechanically stack to form a hexagonal crystal, similar to his hexagonal close-packed cannonballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Tilings and Non-Periodic Patterns

Kepler recognized that regular hexagons can tile a flat surface perfectly without gaps, a concept known as tiling the plane periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Periodic tilings can be duplicated by translation, and may also exhibit rotational symmetries such as two-fold (rhombus), three-fold (equilateral triangles), four-fold (squares), and six-fold (hexagons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These are the only symmetries possible for periodic tilings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Kepler noted the absence of five-fold symmetry in periodic tilings, as regular pentagons do not tile the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Despite this, he attempted to create a pattern with five-fold symmetry, which he published in his book *Harmonics Mundi* or *Harmony of the World* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. While his pattern displayed a certain five-fold symmetry, it was not perfectly clear how it would continue to tile the entire plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Centuries later, Roger Penrose developed aperiodic tilings that could only tile the plane non-periodically, often exhibiting five-fold symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Intriguingly, if Kepler's pentagon pattern is overlaid on Penrose's, the two designs perfectly match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This connection highlights Kepler's early intuitive grasp of complex geometric patterns that would only be formally understood much later in [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | mathematics and physics]].

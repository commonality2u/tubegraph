Turbulent flow is a complex fluid motion characterized by its seemingly disorganized and chaotic nature, in contrast to [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] where fluid particles move in parallel, organized layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:00:30">[00:30]</a>. Despite the lack of a universally agreed-upon formal definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:20">[01:20]</a>, it can be identified by a checklist of characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:34">[01:34]</a>.

## Defining Characteristics

While difficult to define formally, turbulent flow exhibits several key traits:

*   **Unpredictable and Chaotic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:41">[01:41]</a>: Turbulent flow is messy and unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:46">[01:46]</a>. It is definitionally chaotic, meaning it is sensitively dependent on initial conditions. A minor change in the fluid can completely alter its final state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:52">[01:52]</a>. Due to this, precise predictions cannot be made; only statistical analysis is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:06">[02:06]</a>. The Navier-Stokes equations, which govern all fluid flow including turbulence, are notoriously difficult to solve, with a million-dollar prize offered for progress in understanding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:09">[02:09]</a>.
*   **Consists of Interacting Eddies or Vortices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:03:10">[03:10]</a>: Turbulent flow is composed of numerous interacting swirls of fluid, also known as eddies or vortices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:03:13">[03:13]</a>. These eddies span a vast range of sizes, from micrometers to meters in diameter in the case of air in a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:03:19">[03:19]</a>.
*   **Diffusive** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:01">[05:01]</a>: Turbulent flow mixes things together, causing substances like dye, heat, or momentum to spread out and become distributed throughout the fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:04">[05:04]</a>.
*   **Dissipative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:07:07">[07:07]</a>: Turbulence takes in energy at the largest scales (big eddies), which is then transferred down to smaller and smaller eddies. On the smallest scales, this energy is dissipated as heat within the fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:07:11">[07:11]</a>. Therefore, maintaining turbulence requires a constant source of energy to generate large eddies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:07:25">[07:25]</a>.

## Reynolds Number and Transition to Turbulence

The transition from [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] to turbulent flow was experimentally shown by Osborne Reynolds in 1883 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:04:31">[04:31]</a>. He observed that as water flow rate increased in a pipe, an introduced dye stream transitioned from a steady, laminar flow to an oscillating state, and then diffused completely, indicating turbulent flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:04:34">[04:34]</a>.

Reynolds found that the transition to turbulence depends on:
*   Flow rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:18">[05:18]</a>
*   Pipe width (turbulence occurs more readily in wider pipes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:22">[05:22]</a>
*   Fluid viscosity (less readily with more viscous fluids like honey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:26">[05:26]</a>

He calculated a dimensionless quantity known as the [[reynolds_number_and_fluid_dynamics | Reynolds number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:30">[05:30]</a>. This number is equal to the fluid's velocity times a characteristic length (e.g., pipe diameter), divided by the fluid's kinematic viscosity (a measure of its internal friction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:34">[05:34]</a>. High [[reynolds_number_and_fluid_dynamics | Reynolds numbers]] result in turbulent flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:46">[05:46]</a>. Conversely, [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] only occurs at low [[reynolds_number_and_fluid_dynamics | Reynolds numbers]], meaning it is limited to low speeds, small sizes, or viscous fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:06:04">[06:04]</a>.

## Prevalence of Turbulent Flow

In everyday life, most fluid flow is turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:06:14">[06:14]</a>. Examples include:
*   Air flowing in and out of your lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:06:22">[06:22]</a>
*   Blood pumping through the aorta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:06:25">[06:25]</a>
*   The Earth's atmosphere near the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:06:28">[06:28]</a>
*   Air flow in and around cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:06:31">[06:31]</a>

Turbulence also exists on cosmic scales, such as the surface of the Sun, where hot plasma rises in huge convection currents forming Texas-sized cell-like structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:03:38">[03:38]</a>. The turbulent swirls on Jupiter, including the Great Red Spot (larger than Earth), demonstrate turbulence down to the limits of measurement from spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:03:49">[03:49]</a>. Even the dust between stars is in turbulent motion, causing radio sources to twinkle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:04:05">[04:05]</a>, similar to how atmospheric turbulence makes stars twinkle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:04:10">[04:10]</a>. A stunning example is the Orion Nebula, which is 24 light-years across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:04:16">[04:16]</a>.

## [[applications_of_turbulent_flow_in_technology_and_nature | Applications of Turbulent Flow in Technology and Nature]]

Turbulence plays an essential role in various natural phenomena and technological [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | applications]].

*   **Raindrop Formation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:06:36">[06:36]</a>: Modeling shows that turbulent flow is essential for the formation of raindrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:06:36">[06:36]</a>.
*   **Boundary Layers and Drag** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:07:44">[07:44]</a>: When fluid flows over a surface, a boundary layer forms where the fluid's velocity adjusts from zero at the surface (due to friction and adhesion) to the free stream velocity away from the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:07:54">[07:54]</a>. This adjustment creates "skin friction" drag on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:08:32">[08:32]</a>. If the fluid velocity is fast or the surface is long, the boundary layer can transition to turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:08:42">[08:42]</a>. Turbulent boundary layers involve fluid swirling and mixing, bringing faster fluid closer to the surface, which *increases* skin friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:08:51">[08:51]</a>. Planes and large ships primarily experience drag from turbulent boundary layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:09:07">[09:07]</a>. Smooth, clean surfaces can reduce drag by maintaining a laminar boundary layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:09:24">[09:24]</a>.
*   **Aerodynamics of Airplanes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:10:03">[10:03]</a>: While smooth surfaces generally reduce drag, airplanes sometimes intentionally induce turbulence using small fins called vortex generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:10:03">[10:03]</a>. When cruising at low speeds or high angles of attack, airflow can separate from the wing, leading to a condition known as stall, which dramatically decreases lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:10:28">[10:28]</a>. Vortex generators cause turbulence, mixing faster-flowing air down closer to the wing surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:11:02">[11:02]</a>. This energizes the fluid flow, allowing it to follow the wing's curve for longer, thus maintaining attached airflow and lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:11:15">[11:15]</a>. Turbulence is induced for efficient and effective flight, particularly at higher angles of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:11:32">[11:32]</a>.
*   **Golf Ball Dimples** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:11:44">[11:44]</a>: Smooth golf balls do not fly as far as dimpled ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:11:50">[11:50]</a>. A smooth ball forms a [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar boundary layer]] with low skin friction, but the airflow separates easily, leaving a large wake of low-pressure turbulent air behind the ball, which causes significant pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:12:03">[12:03]</a>. Dimples on a golf ball force the boundary layer to become turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:13:01">[13:01]</a>. This turbulent boundary layer can stay attached further around the ball before separating, thereby reducing the size of the low-pressure wake and consequently reducing pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:12:32">[12:32]</a>. The reduction in pressure drag outweighs the increase in skin friction, allowing the golf ball to travel further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:12:48">[12:48]</a>. This effect can reduce the drag coefficient by almost a factor of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:13:14">[13:14]</a>.
*   **Von Karman Vortex Street** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:14:00">[14:00]</a>: When fluid flows around an obstacle, under the right conditions, vortices can be shed alternately from either side, creating a regular pattern downstream called a von Karman Vortex Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:13:48">[13:48]</a>. While this phenomenon follows a predictable pattern and is not strictly turbulent, it is part of the transition to turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:14:26">[14:26]</a>. Scientists are researching ways to harness the energy within these vortex structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:14:34">[14:34]</a>.
*   **Fish Swimming Efficiency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:14:48">[14:48]</a>: Experiments suggest that fish can take advantage of turbulent water to swim more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:14:48">[14:48]</a>, demonstrating how animals have adapted to a turbulent world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:14:53">[14:53]</a>.

## Conclusion

Turbulence is ubiquitous, existing within our bodies, around us, and across scales from the smallest to the largest structures in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:15:01">[15:01]</a>. It is crucial for phenomena like flying airplanes, forming raindrops, making golf balls fly further, and even aiding fish in swimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:15:07">[15:07]</a>. While [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] might appeal to a desire for order, the world, like turbulence, is messy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:15:25">[15:25]</a>. The richness and unpredictability of turbulent flow lead some to find it deeply fascinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:15:32">[15:32]</a>.

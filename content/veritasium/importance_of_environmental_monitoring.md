Environmental monitoring is a critical application for Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. These materials help identify dangerous contaminants and understand human exposure to various substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Materials for Environmental Monitoring

### House Dust
NIST collects house dust by working with maid services, hotels, and motels, gathering vacuum bags, mixing the contents thoroughly, and then measuring everything within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Dust is considered an effective way to determine what individuals and their homes are exposed to environmentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Domestic Sludge
Domestic sludge is sold by the U.S. government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It is derived from solid material removed during wastewater treatment, which is then dried into a fine powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This sludge serves as a record of what has been expelled from human bodies and entered sewer systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Researchers can examine it for traces of toxins or heavy metals, providing insight into contaminants individuals may unknowingly be exposed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. NIST also plans to launch an actual human poop product for similar research next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Contaminated Soil and Water Samples
NIST provides various environmental samples, including:
*   **Lead Paint** They have several types of lead paint SRMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   **Glacier Water** Water from a glacier in Greenland is so rare that its distribution is limited to one unit per customer every three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   **Soil Samples** Dirt from New Jersey and Montana, including samples from contaminated industrial sites, are certified for toxic elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

These SRMs are crucial for laboratories and industries to accurately measure and monitor contaminants in various environmental matrices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

[[johannes_keplers_contributions_to_astronomy_and_geometry | Johannes Kepler]], a renowned scientist who lived and worked in Prague over 400 years ago, was deeply drawn to geometry, believing in a fundamental geometric regularity in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>. This fascination extended beyond theoretical models, like his early solar system concept involving planets on nested spheres separated by Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, to more practical inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Kepler's Conjecture

In 1611, Kepler sought to answer a practical question: how to stack cannonballs to occupy the least amount of space on a ship's deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. He proposed that hexagonal close packing and the face-centered cubic arrangement were the most efficient methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. In these arrangements, the spheres, such as cannonballs or oranges in a supermarket, occupy approximately 74% of the total volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

However, Kepler merely stated this as a fact without providing a formal proof, leading it to be known as **Kepler's Conjecture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## Proof of the Conjecture

Despite the intuitive nature of the stacking method, a formal proof of Kepler's Conjecture took around 400 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. The proof was finally published in the *Journal Form of Mathematics* in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Connection to Snowflakes

Kepler also pondered the hexagonal shape of snowflakes in his pamphlet, *Deniva Sexangula* (On the Six-Cornered Snowflake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. He questioned why snow invariably forms with six corners, rather than five or seven, suggesting an underlying cause beyond chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Although atomic and molecular theory was unknown in his time, Kepler speculated about the mechanical stacking of "tiny units" of water, resembling the hexagonal close-packed arrangement of cannonballs, to form these crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. This foreshadowed modern understanding of crystal structures and their inherent symmetries.

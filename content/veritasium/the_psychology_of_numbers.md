When asked to select a random number, people often demonstrate predictable patterns rather than true randomness. This phenomenon extends beyond simple choices, revealing deeper psychological biases and even mathematical underpinnings that influence human perception of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Non-Random Selection

People are generally poor at [[random number selection | selecting things randomly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### The Blue-Seven Phenomenon
Psychologists have identified a pattern called the "blue-seven phenomenon," where people consistently choose blue and the number 7 when asked to pick a random color and number across various cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### The 37 Phenomenon
When asked to pick a random number between 1 and 100, the number 37 has long been suggested as the equivalent of the blue-seven phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

#### Initial Observations
Interviews revealed that many people spontaneously choose 37, expressing that it was simply the first number that came to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While 7 was often the most common overall answer, possibly due to expectations of a 1-10 range, 37 was consistently the most common two-digit number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

#### Cultural Mentions
*   **Magic Trick**: There is a professional magic trick called "The 37 Force" that relies on an audience member reliably picking 37 out of thin air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Hacker Slang**: The famous Stanford MIT Jargon File, which documents hacker slang, lists 37 as the random number of choice for computer programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. It states that when groups are polled to pick a random number between 1 and 100, 37 is the most commonly chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

#### Survey Results
Despite the widespread belief, no formal polls on this phenomenon existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   A Reddit poll of 1,380 people found 69 to be the most popular number, followed by 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   A community poll with 200,000 responses asking for a random number between 1 and 100 showed that the distribution of "random" numbers is surprisingly consistent and decidedly not random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   Ignoring extremes (1, 100) and culturally significant numbers (42, 69), the numbers that stand out as perceived to be most random are 7, 73, 77, and 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

When asked to pick the number they thought the fewest others would pick, the results were even clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The most selected numbers were 73 and 37, which were nearly tied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
The actual least-picked numbers were multiples of 10 (e.g., 90, 30, 40), suggesting they don't seem random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Why 37 Feels Random

The common selection of 37 and its inverse, 73, suggests they are not truly random choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Psychological Perception
*   **Avoidance of Extremes and Centers**: People tend to avoid numbers that are too extreme (like 1 or 100) or too central (like 50), as they feel "contrived" or "too central" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Odd Numbers**: Even numbers are generally perceived as less random than odd numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Digits 3 and 7**: Numbers containing the digits 3 and 7 are frequently chosen. In surveys, 3 and 7 were the most selected individual digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Mathematical Properties
*   **Primes Feel Random**: Prime numbers are perceived as more random.
    *   They appear less frequently in daily life applications like pixel counts or square footage, as our world is often based on composite numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   There is no simple formula for primes; finding the next prime requires checking each number, making their occurrence seem random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The [[the prime number phenomenon | Prime Number Theorem]] provides an approximation but is not exact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Median Second Prime Factor**: [[the number 37 in culture and mathematics | The number 37]] holds a unique mathematical position as the median second prime factor of all integers. This means that half of all numbers have a second prime factor of 37 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

    *   The smallest prime factor (2) applies to 1/2 of numbers, and 3 applies to 1/6 of numbers (divisible by 3 but not 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   The second smallest prime factor (3) applies to numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., multiples of 6), accounting for 1/6 of all numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   Calculations for other primes (e.g., 5 accounts for 1/10 of numbers) show a distribution that converges, with 37 being the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Other Qualities**: 37 is an irregular prime, Cuban prime, lucky prime, sexy prime, permutable prime, and Padovan prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## The Secretary Problem (37% Rule)

Beyond perception, 37 also plays a practical role in decision-making, notably in a mathematical problem known as the "secretary problem" or "marriage problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This problem applies to situations where one must make an immediate and final decision on a sequence of options without knowing all possibilities in advance (e.g., renting an apartment, accepting a job offer, choosing a life partner) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The optimal strategy to maximize the chance of picking the best option is to:
1.  **Explore**: Automatically reject the first 37% of options to gather information about the range of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
2.  **Decide**: After this initial exploration phase, select the very next option that is better than all previous ones encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

Using this [[Mathematical probability strategies | mathematical probability strategy]], the chances of selecting the best option are approximately 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This rule also applies to time; for example, if aiming to marry in 10 years, one should spend the first 3.7 years exploring options before deciding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This suggests that people may subconsciously gravitate towards 37 because of its importance in optimal decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Cultural and Personal Fascination

The pervasive appearance of 37 has led to individuals actively collecting instances of the number in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. One such individual started the "37 Website" in 1994, spurred by a 1980s comedy routine by Charles Fleischer, who rattled off various coincidences involving the number 37 (e.g., 37 holes in a telephone speaker, Shakespeare wrote 37 plays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This has evolved into a "tireless cabal of 37 people" who share new sightings of the number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This fascination extends beyond base-10 representation, including its forms in Roman numerals, binary, hexadecimal, and octal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

The collective mind of humanity seems to secrete recognize 37's significance. It is not only humanity's go-to random number but also one of its most prominent prime numbers and an ideal number for making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. This innate attraction suggests it "feels right" as a point of settlement or choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

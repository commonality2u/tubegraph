The concept of [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming in shade balls]] arose from public curiosity following a video about [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] on an LA reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Despite the fact that reservoirs are for drinking water and not for swimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, an experiment was conducted using 10,000 purchased [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] to explore the physical challenges involved in moving through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Acquiring and Transporting Shade Balls

The manufacturer of the [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] initially refused to sell them for this purpose due to safety concerns, only making an exception for the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. A significant [[challenges_of_lifting_heavy_objects | challenge]] in undertaking the experiment was the weight of the [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]]. Each ball is half-full of water, making them heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. A bag of 1,200 [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] weighs 300 kilograms (660 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, meaning 10,000 [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] required a large U-Haul truck and a moving company for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Moving Through a Single Layer

Initially, 6,000 [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] were used to create a single layer across a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The manufacturer explicitly did not recommend [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming in shade balls]] due to potential danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Immediate Observations
*   **"Quicksand" Effect:** Moving through the single layer feels like being in a ball pit but with a "quicksand" effect, where movement causes sinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Physical Impact:** Swimmers are frequently hit in the face and body by the [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | balls]], likened to being "knocked around like in a rock tumbler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Noise:** The [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | balls]] create significant noise close to the head, making it nearly impossible to hear anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Increased Drag
[[swimming_in_shade_balls | Swimming in shade balls]] significantly increases drag, the force opposing motion in a fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This is because:
*   The faster a person moves, the more [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | balls]] they encounter per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   The relative speed of the [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | balls]] increases, leading to a greater impact as they are pushed out of the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   This results in a much more strenuous workout compared to regular swimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Specific strokes like breaststroke and front crawl are challenging, and butterfly stroke is even more difficult as it requires pushing [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | balls]] both forward and down/up/out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Moving Through Multiple Layers

Adding more [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | balls]] created multiple layers, similar to how the LA reservoir is covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Challenges of Multiple Layers
*   **Inability to Support Weight:** Attempts to run or slide across the surface of multiple layers of [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Each ball, when fully submerged, supports only about 300 grams. To support an average person entirely above the water would require over 260 [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] trapped directly underneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Impeded Movement:** Traditional swimming is virtually impossible in multiple layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Unlike a single layer where [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | balls]] can easily move past each other, in multiple layers they become trapped and act more like a solid, providing significantly more resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. An "unorthodox" swimming style, primarily beneath the surface of the [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | balls]], was found to be the only way to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Exaggerated Quicksand Effect:** While motionless, a person can float on the surface of multiple layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. However, any movement causes the [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | balls]] to shift, leading to rapid sinking deeper into the mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Quartering winds refer to winds that hit the corner of a building, rather than straight on one of its faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. While designers typically consider winds pushing straight on a building, the analysis of quartering winds proved to be a critical oversight in the initial design of the Citicorp Center, leading to a near-catastrophic structural flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## The Citicorp Center's Vulnerability

The Citicorp Center, opened in 1977, was hailed as an engineering marvel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Its unique design, driven by the need to build around St. Peter's Church, featured corner columns at the center of each face, making the skyscraper appear to be on stilts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Structural engineer Bill LeMessurier devised a system of diagonal chevron braces to transfer gravity and wind loads to these central stilts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This system allowed for a lighter construction, saving money and weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

However, a critical change during construction involved swapping welds for bolts to connect the chevron braces, saving approximately a quarter of a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. LeMessurier's team initially calculated the number of bolts based on winds hitting the building perpendicularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## Discovery of the Flaw

In May 1978, less than a year after the Citicorp Center opened, LeMessurier discovered its fatal flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. His realization stemmed from a conversation with another client about welding similar braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. He learned that bolts had been used instead of welds in Citicorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

A month later, a student's inquiry prompted LeMessurier to re-examine his calculations, particularly considering wind loads from all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. He then realized that the worst-case loading was not from ordinary straight-on wind, but from wind pushing straight on a corner of the building â€“ quartering winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### Increased Stresses from Quartering Winds

LeMessurier's re-calculations showed that quartering winds resulted in forces 40% higher on some chevron braces compared to perpendicular wind loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This increase was critical because the bolted connections, unlike the originally planned welds, could not adequately withstand these elevated stresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

Further analysis at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel provided a dynamic analysis, showing that stresses could increase by up to 60% when the building was moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The weakest joints were found at the 30th floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. While the original calculations specified four bolts per joint, quartering winds, combined with an incorrect factor of safety, indicated that some joints actually needed 14 bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

## Potential Catastrophe

With the structural flaw identified, LeMessurier realized that winds of just 110 kilometers per hour could cause the building to collapse in the middle of Manhattan, potentially killing thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. More than 200,000 people lived and worked in the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The risk was compounded if a storm knocked out power to the building's tuned mass damper, which was designed to reduce sway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. In such a scenario, 110 km/h winds for just five minutes could collapse the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

Historically, a storm of that magnitude had a one in 67-year chance of occurring, but without the damper, the probability increased to one in 16 in any given year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Hurricane Belle, with 110 km/h gusts, had passed through New York City just a year before Citicorp's completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

LeMessurier faced immense [[challenges_and_decision_making_in_earharts_aviation_attempts | challenges and decision making]] and ethical dilemmas, contemplating even suicide, but ultimately decided to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. The repair plan, dubbed Project Serene, involved secretly welding two five-centimeter thick steel plates on each of the 200 joints nightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. An evacuation plan for a 10-block radius was also developed with the Red Cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

The Citicorp case had significant [[impact_of_the_citicorp_case_on_building_regulations_and_architecture | historical impacts and their consequences]] on building regulations and architecture. After the story became public in 1995, New York updated its building code to explicitly require quartering wind calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. The case is now taught globally in engineering ethics courses as an example of integrity and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

While a 2021 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded that perpendicular winds exerted greater pressure, their analysis did not include the internal structure specific to Citicorp, keeping the debate somewhat alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. Nonetheless, the Citicorp Center serves as a vital reminder of the complex forces, including quartering winds, that must be considered in skyscraper design to ensure public safety.

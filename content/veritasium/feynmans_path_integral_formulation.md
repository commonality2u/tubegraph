For much of modern physics, it was believed that every object travels along a single, distinct trajectory through space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, this view has been disproven by the understanding that everything is actually exploring all possible paths simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, a concept central to [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] and formalized by Richard Feynman's path integral formulation.

## The Principle of Least Action

A simple thought experiment involving a person running and swimming to rescue a friend illustrates that the fastest path is not necessarily the shortest straight line, but an optimal path somewhere in between, depending on speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | mathematical relationship]] is identical to the law governing light passing from one medium to another, where light also takes the fastest path from point A to point B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This raises a curious question: how does light "know" which path to take to minimize its journey time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>?

The initial, classical understanding was that light simply obeys local rules, changing direction upon encountering a new medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, this view does not account for the fact that light, and indeed all quantum particles like electrons and protons, truly explore all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The apparent single, well-defined trajectories we observe are, in essence, a profound illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

This concept is rooted in a quantity known as "action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The obscure scientist Maupertuis proposed that a quantity called "action," defined as mass times velocity times distance, should always be minimized by any system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Later, Hamilton showed this action to be equivalent to the integral over time of kinetic energy minus potential energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Action became a useful alternative method for solving physics problems, especially when Newton's laws became too complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## The Birth of Quantum Mechanics and Planck's Constant

Around the turn of the 20th century, action became central to the birth of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This began with the problem of blackbody radiation, specifically, how to maximize visible light from a hot filament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Scientists observed that above 500°C, all materials emitted light with an almost identical distribution, with hotter objects emitting more energy and shifting the peak wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

To understand this theoretically, they imagined a perfect blackbody, an object that absorbs all light falling on it and perfectly emits radiation based on its temperature, such as a hole in a metal cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Theorists reasoned that electrons in the cavity walls emit electromagnetic waves, which form standing waves inside the cavity. Only these standing waves survive over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Based on this, the Rayleigh-Jeans law predicted that the number of vibrational modes, and thus emitted energy, would increase with shorter wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This led to the "ultraviolet catastrophe," predicting infinite energy at the shortest wavelengths, which contradicted experimental data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Max Planck solved this problem, despite his professor's advice that physics was a "complete science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. In an "act of desperation," Planck proposed that energy could only be emitted in discrete multiples of a smallest amount, a "quantum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. He posited that the energy of one quantum was directly proportional to its frequency, expressed as `E = hf`, where `h` is a constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This "quantization" explained why fewer atoms could emit higher frequency (shorter wavelength) radiation, causing the spectrum to peak and then fall to zero, thus resolving the ultraviolet catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Planck's constant `h` has the units of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, and he later proposed that any change in nature would occur in whole multiples of this quantum of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Quantization Spreads

The idea of quantization spread rapidly:
*   In 1905, Albert Einstein used Planck's theory to claim that light truly consists of discrete packets, or photons, with energy `hf`, explaining the photoelectric effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   In 1913, Niels Bohr sought to understand atomic stability. He realized that an electron orbiting a nucleus has angular momentum (mass times velocity times radius), which also has the same units as action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Bohr arbitrarily "discretized" the orbital angular momentum, proposing it could only exist in multiples of `h-bar` (`h/2π`). This "quantized" angular momentum allowed him to correctly predict the energy levels of the hydrogen atom and its spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   Eleven years later, Louis de Broglie provided a physical reason for Bohr's quantization. He proposed that if light could be both a wave and a particle, then matter particles like electrons could also be waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. De Broglie defined the wavelength of any object as Planck's constant divided by its momentum (`λ = h/mv`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. For an electron to remain bound in an atom, it must exist as a standing wave, meaning a whole number of wavelengths must fit around the orbit's circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This condition mathematically reproduced Bohr's quantized angular momentum, providing a deeper understanding of its origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Feynman's Path Integral Formulation

It is this wave nature of quantum objects that implies they do not follow a single path, but rather explore all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### The Double-Slit Experiment Analogy
In the double-slit experiment, where electrons are fired one at a time through two slits to a screen, it's impossible to determine which slit the particle went through. [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | Quantum mechanics]] dictates that it must go through both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. To find the probability of finding a particle at a point on the screen, one must add up the amplitudes of the wave going through each slit and then square the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

Richard Feynman, as a student (in a story, though not strictly true, the logic is sound), extended this concept: if you add a third, fourth, or infinite number of slits, you continue to add the amplitudes from all slits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. If you imagine infinite screens, each with infinite slits, it becomes clear that even in empty space, particles must be exploring all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This includes paths that seemingly travel faster than light, go back in time, or even traverse absurd distances like to the moon and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### How it Works
Feynman's formulation suggests that anything moving from point A to point B has some chance to take any path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. To calculate the probability of an event, we must include all these paths. Each path is assigned an "amplitude" (a complex number represented as a vector or "arrow" that spins). The "stopwatch" for each path measures its "phase," which increases as the particle wave follows the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This phase (`phi`) is directly proportional to the classical action of that path, divided by Planck's constant (specifically, `e^(i * Action/h-bar)`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

The total probability is found by adding up all these "arrows" for all possible paths and then squaring the length of the resulting arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

### Why We See Single Trajectories
The key to understanding why we don't observe "crazy paths" lies in the incredibly small value of Planck's constant, `h-bar` (approximately 10^-34 joule-seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. For everyday, macroscopic objects, the action of any ordinary path is vastly larger than `h-bar`. This means the phase for these paths spins around trillions of times, causing their amplitude arrows to point in essentially random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

When these random arrows are summed, they largely cancel each other out through destructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. The only paths whose amplitudes do *not* cancel out are those extremely close to the path of "least action" (or more precisely, stationary action, where the action doesn't change significantly with small variations in the path). For these paths, the arrows point in nearly the same direction, leading to constructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. These are the paths we observe, explaining how classical mechanics emerges from [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

Massive particles have large actions compared to `h-bar`, so only paths extremely close to the true path of least action contribute significantly, making them appear more particle-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. For smaller particles like electrons or photons, actions are smaller, allowing for a greater spread of trajectories they might take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

### Experimental Demonstration
The reality of this principle can be demonstrated with a diffraction grating. While typically light reflecting off a mirror follows the angle of incidence equals angle of reflection, a finely grooved grating (like a piece of foil with thousands of lines per millimeter) can manipulate the interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. By selectively canceling out the phases of some paths, this grating can cause light to reflect at unexpected angles, confirming that light *does* explore all paths, but normally most of these "crazy" paths destructively interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This even works with a laser, making light appear to reflect from a part of the mirror where it shouldn't, due to the clever interference of the grating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

## Action as the Fundamental Concept
The principle of least action, and by extension Feynman's path integral formulation, is a fundamental concept in theoretical physics. Modern physicists, especially in particle physics, often work with "action" and "Lagrangians" (which define the action of a system) rather than forces or energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. The laws of physics can be derived directly from the correct Lagrangian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, making it a single mathematical framework applicable across classical mechanics, special relativity, and electrodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. The hunt for a "theory of everything" is essentially a search for the universal Lagrangian that can describe all laws of physics in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

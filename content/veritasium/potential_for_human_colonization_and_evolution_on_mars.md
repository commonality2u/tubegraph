Becoming a multiplanetary species is seen as crucial for humanity's long-term survival, with Mars being a primary candidate for colonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Travel to Mars would involve an eight-month journey through microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Martian Gravity and its Effects

The gravity on Mars is approximately 37% of Earth's gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This lower gravity would allow individuals to jump much higher, potentially doubling airtime for an average jumper and making it easy to dunk on a regulation basketball hoop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For comparison, the Moon's gravity is only 1/6 of Earth's, enabling "crazy aerobics" without exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## [[Challenges of microgravity and its effects on the human body]]

### Physiological Impacts
A significant challenge of low gravity environments, such as during the transit to Mars or on the Martian surface, is the difficulty in exercising effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. On Earth, even lifting an arm provides a minor workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, but this natural resistance is absent in microgravity and significantly reduced on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

During spaceflight, muscles weaken and atrophy; studies indicate a muscle mass decrease of up to 20% in flights lasting merely 5 to 11 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Traditional weightlifting is ineffective in these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, necessitating reliance on elastic resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Astronauts on the space station, for instance, are elastically tethered to treadmills and exercise for two and a half hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Furthermore, the lack of weight pushing on bones leads to a decrease in bone density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Astronauts can lose 1 to 2 percent of bone mass per month, primarily in their lower extremities, a rate over ten times faster than age-related osteoporosis on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Everyday Activities
In weightless conditions, other forces like the surface tension of water become significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This makes everyday activities such as washing one's face, showering, brushing teeth, and using the bathroom considerably more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Unique Physics Phenomena
The absence of Earth's gravity also reveals unusual physical effects. An example is the behavior of a spinning disc, which, in microgravity, can flip back and forth around its intermediate axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This phenomenon, known as the intermediate axis theorem, demonstrates that rotation about an intermediate axis (neither the least nor greatest moment of inertia) is unstable, and any small disturbance will cause it to rotate about another axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### [[Radiation exposure during space travel]]
A journey to Mars also involves significant exposure to radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Astronauts have reported seeing flashes of light with their eyes closed while in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. These flashes are believed to be the human body's reaction to cosmic radiation, likely from heavy particles or energy bursts passing through the eyeball or optic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges for Colonization
These difficulties are considered challenges to be overcome, rather than insurmountable obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Solutions for Physical Health
*   **Spacesuits:** Modern spacesuits, weighing as much as 310 pounds on Earth, would make a person feel about as heavy on Mars as they do on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This extra weight would help maintain muscle and bone mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Radiation Shielding:** Spaceships can be shielded against radiation using materials like insulation or water, which is an excellent radiation absorber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Nausea
One major challenge of different gravity environments is the nausea it induces, as human bodies have not evolved for such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Potential for Human Evolution on Mars
Human bodies have evolved over millions of years under Earth's gravity of 9.8 m/sÂ² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. If humanity were to establish colonies and permanently live on Mars, future human evolution might take very different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Certain rules in [[mathematics]] can lead to unexpected and paradoxical results, such as line segments having no length or a single sphere being transformable into two identical spheres without adding material [00:00:00]. These counterintuitive outcomes stem from an axiom that, while appearing intuitive and practical, also creates significant paradoxes [00:00:17]. The core of this issue revolves around the concept of choice in [[mathematics]] [00:00:29].

## The Problem of Choice in Mathematics

In [[mathematics]], unlike human thought, true random selection is not possible because formulas consistently yield the same results [00:00:40]. Computers, for instance, simulate randomness using algorithms based on factors like current local time [00:00:51]. Therefore, mathematical selection must follow a defined rule [00:01:07].

A simple rule might be to "always choose the smallest thing" [00:01:10]. For whole positive integers, this would be one [00:01:14], and for prime numbers, it would be two [00:01:18]. However, this rule fails when applied to [[real_numbers | real numbers]] (any number—positive, negative, whole, fraction, or irrational like pi or the square root of two) [00:01:22]. It's impossible to choose the smallest [[real_numbers | real number]] as they stretch to negative [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] [00:01:30]. Even trying to choose the smallest number after one leads to an infinite sequence of closer numbers (e.g., 1.01, 1.0001, etc.) [00:01:38]. This inability to specify order (next, previous, first, last) within [[real_numbers | real numbers]] highlights a paradox: despite infinite options, a clear selection method is elusive [00:02:01].

## [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Georg Cantor]] and the Sizes of [[infinity_in_mathematics | Infinity]]

The quest to resolve this began in 1870 with [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Georg Cantor]], a German mathematician who aimed to definitively order the [[real_numbers | real numbers]] [00:02:16]. His early work, published at age 29, challenged centuries-old understandings of [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] [00:02:31].

### Galileo's View on [[infinity_in_mathematics | Infinity]]

For centuries, the understanding of [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] was shaped by Galileo's 1638 book [00:02:42]. Galileo posed the question of whether there are more natural numbers or square numbers [00:02:48]. While square numbers appear sparser, Galileo realized that a one-to-one mapping could be made between every natural number and its square (e.g., 1->1, 2->4, 3->9) [00:03:05]. This led him to conclude that the two sets must be of the same size, implying that terms like "more than" or "less than" don't apply to [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] in the usual sense [00:03:12]. This view, that [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] is one undifferentiated concept of "foreverness," prevailed for hundreds of years [00:03:31].

### [[countable_vs_uncountable_infinity | Countable vs. Uncountable Infinities]]

In 1874, [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]] challenged this by wondering if there could be two [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] sets that could not be perfectly mapped to each other, thus representing different sizes of [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] [00:03:50]. He compared the set of natural numbers to the set of [[real_numbers | real numbers]] between zero and one [00:04:00].

[[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]]'s strategy involved assuming a perfect one-to-one mapping between these sets [00:04:06]. He imagined an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] list pairing natural numbers with [[real_numbers | real numbers]] between zero and one, written in any order [00:04:11]. He then constructed a new [[real_numbers | real number]] by taking the first digit of the first number and adding one, the second digit of the second number and adding one, and so on, subtracting one if the digit was eight or nine to avoid duplicates [00:04:29]. This new number, constructed diagonally, would differ from every number on his original list in at least one decimal place [00:04:57]. This proof, known as [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]]'s Diagonalization Proof, demonstrated that there are more [[real_numbers | real numbers]] between zero and one than there are natural numbers extending to [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] [00:05:14].

[[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]]'s revelation was profound: [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] comes in different "sizes" [00:05:26].
*   **[[countable_vs_uncountable_infinity | Countable Infinities]]**: Sets like square numbers, integers, or rational numbers can be perfectly paired with natural numbers, meaning they can be literally counted (one, two, three, etc.) [00:05:32].
*   **[[countable_vs_uncountable_infinity | Uncountable Infinities]]**: Larger infinities, such as the set of all [[real_numbers | real numbers]] or complex numbers, cannot be matched one-to-one with natural numbers [00:05:47].

This discovery "rocked the mathematical community," being labeled a "horror" and a "grave disease" [00:06:00].

## The Well-Ordering Theorem

Undeterred, [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]] pursued a grander goal: to show that even uncountably [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] sets could be placed in a definitive order, what he called a "well-order" [00:06:17]. For a set to be well-ordered, it needs:
1.  A clear starting point [00:06:33].
2.  Every subset must also have a clear starting point [00:06:36].

For example, natural numbers are well-ordered (starting point one; any subset like 6, 7, 8 starts with six) [00:06:44]. [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]] also showed how integers, which stretch to [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] in both directions, could be well-ordered [00:07:01]. He proposed starting with zero, then ordering by absolute value (1, -1, 2, -2, etc.) [00:07:07]. This ordering allowed integers to be mapped to natural numbers, proving they are the same size [00:07:27]. Other valid well-orderings exist, such as 0, 1, 2... followed by -1, -2... [00:07:37].

### Cantor's Claim and Controversy

In his next book, [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]] published his well-ordering theorem, claiming that every set, including uncountably [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] ones like the [[real_numbers | real numbers]], could be well-ordered [00:08:09]. However, he couldn't actually prove this [00:08:21]. His confidence stemmed from his devout Lutheran beliefs, asserting divine inspiration for his theory [00:08:34].

Without mathematical proof, this claim led to a second wave of attacks and ostracization from the mathematical community [00:09:06]. A prominent critic was Leopold Kronecker, [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]]'s former teacher and head of [[mathematics]] at the University of Berlin, who dismissed [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]] as a "scientific charlatan" [00:09:15]. Kronecker's opposition reportedly led to [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]]'s denied applications to the University of Berlin [00:09:31].

### Cantor's Personal Struggles

In 1884, [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]] suffered the first of many nervous breakdowns, being confined to a sanitarium [00:09:49]. His inability to find a starting point for well-ordering the [[real_numbers | real numbers]] haunted him [00:10:00]. After his release, he stepped away from [[mathematics]] for 15 years, teaching philosophy [00:10:07].

A major challenge came at the 1904 International Congress of Mathematicians, where Julius König announced proof that [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]]'s well-ordering theorem was wrong [00:10:18]. This public humiliation deeply affected [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]] [00:10:39].

## The Resolution: [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Zermelo]] and the [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Axiom of Choice]]

Among the attendees was Ernst [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Zermelo]], a German mathematician interested in [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]]'s work [00:10:42]. Within 24 hours, [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Zermelo]] found a contradiction in König's proof [00:10:57]. A month later, he published a three-page article titled "Proof That Every Set Can Be Well-Ordered," which was flawless [00:11:05].

### Formalizing the [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Axiom of Choice]]

[[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Zermelo]]'s breakthrough identified an unconscious mechanism in [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]]'s work: the assumption that one could make an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] number of choices at once from any set, including uncountably [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] ones [00:11:15]. This assumption was not explicitly permitted in the mathematical rule book [00:11:40].

[[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Zermelo]] realized this assumption needed to be formalized as an axiom – a simple statement accepted as true without proof [00:11:48]. He proposed [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]], stating that if you have [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinitely]] many non-empty sets, there is a way to choose one element from each set [00:12:04]. While seemingly obvious for finite sets or [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] sets with a clear rule (like "choose the smallest"), it becomes crucial when no natural rule exists and choices must be made from [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinitely]] many, especially uncountable, sets [00:12:16]. The axiom doesn't specify *how* the choices are made, only that they *are possible* [00:12:39].

### Well-Ordering the Real Numbers with the [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Axiom of Choice]]

[[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Zermelo]] used [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] to well-order the [[real_numbers | real numbers]] [00:12:58]. He chooses a number (X1) from the set of all [[real_numbers | real numbers]], then another (X2) from the remaining subset, and so on [00:13:00]. Crucially, these choices are made from *all possible subsets simultaneously*, not one at a time [00:13:24].

To account for the greater number of [[real_numbers | real numbers]] compared to natural numbers, [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Zermelo]] introduces "omega numbers" (e.g., omega, omega+1, omega+2) [00:13:47]. These numbers extend beyond the natural numbers, indicating order but not quantity [00:14:06]. This allows for labeling chosen [[real_numbers | real numbers]] (X omega, X omega+1, etc.) until the original set is empty, creating a well-ordered set where every number has a first number, and every subset also has a first number [00:14:16].

This well-ordered sequence of [[real_numbers | real numbers]] might appear unfamiliar (e.g., a billion before 0.2), but it proves that such an order exists [00:14:43]. It resolves the issue of mathematically choosing a "first" [[real_numbers | real number]], enabling a starting point for any set, regardless of its [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] [00:14:54]. Thus, [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]]'s well-ordering theorem and [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Zermelo]]'s [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Axiom of Choice]] are equivalent [00:15:11]. [[georg_cantor_and_the_development_of_set_theory | Cantor]] was greatly relieved by [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Zermelo]]'s proof [00:15:19].

## Paradoxical Consequences of the [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Axiom of Choice]]

Despite its utility, the [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Axiom of Choice]] generated disturbing results, as mathematicians had unknowingly relied on it for decades [00:17:00].

### Vitali Set and Non-Measurable Sets

In 1905, Giuseppe Vitali used [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] to construct a set of numbers that challenged the concept of "length" [00:17:55]. Vitali assigned every [[real_numbers | real number]] between zero and one into one of [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] "bins" or groups [00:18:07]. Numbers with a rational difference went into the same bin, while those with an irrational difference went into separate bins [00:18:32]. For example, 3/4 and 1/2 would be in the same bin (difference 1/4), as would √2/2 and (√2/2 - 1/4) [00:19:06]. All rational numbers between 0 and 1 would be in one group [00:19:18].

Vitali then used [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] to select exactly one representative number from each group, forming the "Vitali set" [00:20:13]. He then made [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] copies of this set, shifting each by a different rational number between negative one and positive one [00:20:53]. Merging these shifted sets covers every [[real_numbers | real number]] between zero and one without overlap [00:21:31].

The paradox arises when trying to determine the "size" of the Vitali set [00:21:49]. The union of the shifted sets must have a size between one and three [00:21:56]. However, if the Vitali set had zero length, its [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] sum would be zero; if it had any small positive length, its [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] sum would be [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] [00:22:29]. This contradiction leads to the conclusion that the Vitali set is "unmeasurable" [00:22:44]. Non-measurable sets defy consistent definitions of size, length, area, or probability, challenging the foundation of quantifiable [[mathematics]] [00:22:54].

### Banach-Tarski Paradox

In 1924, Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski used [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] to demonstrate the Banach-Tarski Paradox [00:23:19]. They proved that a single solid ball could be split into just five pieces, which, by careful rotation and movement, could be reassembled into two identical balls [00:23:27]. This process could theoretically continue to produce an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] number of balls from one [00:23:41].

This is explained through an analogy of an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinitely]] branching graph, where moves (up, down, left, right) are made without immediate reversal, and each new line is half the size of the previous one [00:23:56]. The graph can be broken into five sections, which can then be shifted and reassembled to perfectly recreate the entire graph twice over [00:24:32].

Applying this to a ball, four rotations (up, down, left, right) by an irrational portion of a circle are used [00:25:33]. The [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Axiom of Choice]] is needed to pick unique starting points to cover the uncountably [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] points on the ball's surface [00:26:21]. The points are then split into five groups (one for starting points, four based on the final rotation), which can be rotated and reassembled to form two identical balls [00:26:51].

While theoretically possible, these "cuts" are not physically plausible because the pieces are non-measurable, similar to the Vitali set [00:28:06]. The process violates common understanding of size and volume, leading to paradoxes [00:28:18].

## The Status of the [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Axiom of Choice]]

The debates surrounding [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] created a crisis in [[mathematics]] for over 30 years [00:29:20].

### Independence of the [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | Axiom of Choice]]

Answers began to emerge in 1938 when [[gdels_incompleteness_theorems | Kurt Gödel]], an Austrian mathematician, proved that a mathematical universe exists where all other accepted axioms of [[history_and_foundations_of_set_theory_and_mathematics | set theory]] hold true, and so does [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] [00:29:32]. Then, in 1963, Paul Cohen proved that another universe exists where the other axioms hold true, but [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] does not [00:29:47].

This situation is analogous to the parallel postulate in geometry [00:29:57]. The first four postulates (axioms) are fundamental rules, while the fifth (parallel postulate) determines the type of geometry (e.g., spherical, flat, hyperbolic) [00:30:03]. All these geometries are valid, depending on the chosen axioms [00:30:29]. Similarly, [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] can neither be proven nor disproven from other axioms [00:30:38]. As long as the other axioms are consistent, adding [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | choice]] does not introduce contradictions [00:30:43]. Cohen received the Fields Medal for his work on this and other contributions to [[history_and_foundations_of_set_theory_and_mathematics | set theory]] [00:30:51].

### Modern Acceptance and Utility

After [[gdels_incompleteness_theorems | Gödel]] and Cohen's work, most debates about [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] subsided [00:30:58]. Despite its counterintuitive results like non-measurable sets and infinite duplication, it is incredibly useful [00:31:15]. It allows mathematicians to replace lengthy explicit proofs with concise arguments, often extending finite case proofs to [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] cases in a single line, reducing 20-page proofs to half a page [00:31:24].

Furthermore, [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] is essential for some proofs where the general case cannot be proven without it [00:31:45]. While some mathematicians prefer proofs without [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | choice]] for the additional information provided by step-by-step generalization to [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] cases, and some study universes without it [00:31:53], [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] is almost universally accepted today [00:32:12]. Generations of mathematicians have been taught with it as a given, often using it unknowingly [00:32:17]. Not including [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] makes progress in modern [[mathematics]] very difficult [00:32:28].

Ultimately, the decision to include [[the_axiom_of_choice_and_its_implications | the Axiom of Choice]] depends on the specific mathematical goals [00:32:36].

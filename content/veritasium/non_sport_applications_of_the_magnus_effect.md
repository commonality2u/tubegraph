While the [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] is widely recognized for its importance in sports like tennis, soccer, and golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, it also has potential and historical applications outside of sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The effect describes how rotating objects flying through the air are affected by a force perpendicular to the direction of motion and the axis of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Flettner Rotors on Ships

One notable non-sport application of the [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] is seen in "Flettner rotors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. These spinning cylinders can replace traditional sails on ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. By deflecting crosswinds, Flettner rotors use the [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] to propel the ship forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

A modern example is the E-Ship 1, which utilizes four spinning Flettner rotors to enhance its efficiency and reduce the amount of diesel fuel consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

## Experimental Aircraft Designs

The [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] has also been explored in aviation:

*   **Early Aircraft:** An experimental plane was built with spinning cylinders taking the place of wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. These cylinders were capable of generating more lift than conventional wings by utilizing the [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. However, this design also produced significantly more drag, rendering it impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This particular plane only flew once before it crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Modern Revival:** The [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] is experiencing a resurgence in aerospace interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. There are current experimental rotor wing aircraft that derive all their lift from spinning cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

Looking ahead, the [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] could contribute to more than just the flight of [[magnus_effect_on_a_basketball | basketballs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

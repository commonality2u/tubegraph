Shade balls are small, spherical objects deployed in large numbers on the surface of water reservoirs. The Los Angeles Reservoir, for instance, holds 96 million shade balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While often mistakenly believed to primarily reduce evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, their main [[purpose_of_shade_balls_in_reservoirs | purpose]] is to prevent the formation of harmful chemicals in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Key Design Features

### Shape and Stability
Shade balls are spherical, a design choice crucial for their functionality. This shape prevents them from stacking up or perching on the reservoir's banks as water levels fluctuate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. They are designed to spread out completely, covering the water as best as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Partial Water Filling
These balls are partially filled with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This feature is vital to prevent them from being blown away by high winds, such as those experienced at the LA Reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The water filling also makes them wobble if they do start to roll, further aiding in their containment within the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This partial filling, however, makes them significantly more difficult to push aside, especially when they form close-packed, crystal-like structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Driving a boat through them is described as very difficult, akin to moving through peanut butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Designs
Other proposed designs, such as hexagonal shapes, were considered but rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The concern was that these shapes might lock together or get stuck on the reservoir banks as water levels change, which would hinder their ability to effectively cover the water surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Material Composition

### High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)
Shade balls are made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This material is commonly used in the water industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, and is the same material used for gallon milk jugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Food-Grade Plastic for Drinking Water Safety
The HDPE used is a food-grade plastic, ensuring it is safe for contact with drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. They are described as "totally inert" and harmless, even if a piece were to be chewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Color and Pigmentation (Carbon Black)
Shade balls are intentionally black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: The black color is chosen to block all light from reaching the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This is critical because sunlight triggers a reaction between bromide and chlorine, forming carcinogenic bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Longevity**: The black pigment is safe for drinking water contact and is stable even when exposed to elements for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Carbon Black**: The material contains "carbon black," which is essential for making the plastic last for at least 10 years in the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Without carbon black, the balls would be clear like milk cartons and would not last in the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Alternative Colors**: Tests were conducted with three different shades of blue, but the dyes were unstable and could not guarantee a lifespan of more than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Heat Absorption**: Although they absorb more energy and get hotter on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, the balls do not bleach or transfer significant heat to the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The bottom of the balls remains cool, and the air trapped within the balls acts as a good thermal insulator, resulting in a slight cooling effect on the water beneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Cost and Lifespan
Shade balls cost approximately 33-34 cents each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> and are designed to last for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. They also have a salvage value as they are a recyclable material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The savings from reduced chlorination and [[impact_of_shade_balls_on_evaporation_and_water_quality | evaporation]] are estimated to cover at least half the cost of the balls over their lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

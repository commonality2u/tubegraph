The phenomenon of [[cognitive_biases_in_problem_solving | cognitive biases]] significantly influences how individuals approach problem-solving and seek information. One such bias, confirmation bias, was vividly demonstrated through a number sequence game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## The Number Sequence Game

Participants were presented with an initial three-number sequence: 2, 4, 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Their task was to determine the underlying rule by proposing their own sets of three numbers, to which the host would respond "yes" (it follows the rule) or "no" (it doesn't) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Initial Approaches and Misconceptions
Most participants immediately formed a hypothesis, such as "multiply by 2," and then consistently proposed sequences that fit *their* perceived rule, like 16, 32, 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, 3, 6, 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, or 10, 20, 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. While all these sequences followed the *actual* rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, "multiply by 2" was not the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This approach, common among most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, involved seeking to confirm what they already believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### The Breakthrough: Seeking Disconfirming Evidence
The key to solving the puzzle lay in proposing numbers that were *not* expected to fit the participant's hypothesis. When a participant suggested 2, 4, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, and it was confirmed to fit the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, it started to challenge their initial assumptions. This eventually led to the correct rule: "numbers in increasing order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Any numbers in ascending order, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 10, 15, 25, would follow the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The only way to get a "no" was to propose numbers not in ascending order, such as 10, 9, 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## What is Confirmation Bias?
Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek out and interpret information in a way that confirms one's existing beliefs or hypotheses. Instead of trying to disprove their own theories, people often look for evidence that supports what they already think is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### The Black Swan Metaphor
The concept of confirmation bias is illustrated by the "black swan" metaphor, inspired by the book *The Black Swan* by Nassim Taleb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Historically, the theory held that all swans were white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Every sighting of a white swan seemed to confirm this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, one can never definitively prove a theory true through confirming instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The discovery of black swans in Australia disproved the long-held belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## The Importance of Disconfirming Evidence
To truly test a theory or belief, it is crucial to seek "no's" rather than "yes's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Getting a "no" provides much more informative data than a "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Scientific Method
> This principle is fundamental to the [[the_importance_of_disconfirming_evidence | scientific method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Scientists actively set out to disprove their theories; it is only when they *cannot* disprove them that the theories are considered to be getting at something true about reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Application in Daily Life
Applying this strategy in daily life means that if one believes something to be true, they should try as hard as possible to disprove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This rigorous approach helps to uncover the truth and avoid self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

[[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Quantum mechanics]] operates differently from classical mechanics, where knowing a system's state (like a particle's position and velocity) allows for precise future calculations using equations such as Newton's second law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. In [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]], knowing a particle's quantum state, specifically its [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]], enables calculation of its future behavior using the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] typically spreads out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The challenge arises because the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] itself is not directly observed in [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Instead, measurement reveals the particle at a single point in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This presents a conflict: how to reconcile the smoothly evolving, spread-out [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] with the point-like particle detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Early quantum theorists prioritized the measurement, as it was directly observed and aligned with our experience of a world of discrete particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Max Born's Interpretation and Wavefunction Collapse

Erwin Schrödinger formulated his [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave equation]] because scientists like [[De Broglies hypothesis and waveparticle duality | De Broglie]] suspected that matter possessed [[Wave particle duality | wave-like properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Max Born proposed a way to interpret the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]]: squaring its complex amplitude at any point in space yields the probability of finding the particle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This "Born rule" introduced probability into the core of reality's description, making the universe non-deterministic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The conventional understanding of [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] introduces two sets of rules:
*   When not observed, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] evolves according to the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   When a measurement is made, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] suddenly and irreversibly "collapses," with the probability of a particular outcome given by the squared amplitude of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] associated with that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Schrödinger's Cat Thought Experiment

Schrödinger disliked this formulation, leading him to invent the famous "Schrödinger's Cat" thought experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. In this experiment, a cat is placed in a box with a radioactive atom, a radiation detector, and a release mechanism for poisonous cyanide gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The goal is to magnify the quantum state of the atom to a macroscopic, tangible level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

If the atom decays, the detector triggers the poison, and the cat dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. If it doesn't decay, the cat lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Since the cat's state is tied to the atom's state, they are said to be **entangled** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. According to [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]], the atom is typically in a **superposition** of both decayed and not-decayed states simultaneously, assuming no measurement has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This superposition then extends to the detector and the cat, meaning the cat is, quantum mechanically, both alive and dead at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Only when the box is opened and a measurement is made does the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] "collapse," and the cat becomes definitively either dead or alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Schrödinger used this to highlight what he saw as a flaw in the standard interpretation of [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Superposition

**Superposition** is the concept that quantum objects can exist in multiple states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While it seems counter-intuitive, it's indirectly observed in experiments like the double-slit experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. When individual electrons are fired through two slits, they produce an interference pattern on a screen, forcing the conclusion that a single electron somehow passes through both slits simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This behavior is easily understood with waves, which are spread out in space and can interfere with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Since electrons are represented by a [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] when not observed, the double-slit experiment provides concrete evidence for superposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Entanglement

**Entanglement** describes a situation where interacting particles are described by a single, shared [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]], rather than separate ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. For example, if two electrons scatter off each other, their individual trajectories are probabilistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. However, if the momentum of one electron is measured, the momentum of the other is immediately known to be equal and opposite due to conservation of momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This happens instantaneously, even if the electrons are light-years apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Before measurement, each electron's momentum is in a superposition of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Measuring one instantaneously collapses the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] for both, because they are entangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Rigorously, there is only one [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]]: that of the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Individual [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave functions]] are only applicable to isolated, unentangled particles; once they interact, entanglement is the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Measurement and the Many Worlds Interpretation

Superposition and entanglement are fundamental aspects of [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum theory]], described by [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave functions]] evolving via the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The "measurement postulate," which states a separate rule for measurement, can seem odd because measurement is simply the interaction of one quantum system with another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

If the measurement postulate is removed, and all systems (including observers) obey the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]], then in Schrödinger's cat experiment, when an observer opens the box, there is no [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Instead, the observer becomes entangled with the superposed state of the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This implies the observer would see the cat both alive and dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The solution proposed by the [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds Interpretation]] (formulated by Hugh Everett) is that the observer who saw the cat alive and the observer who saw it dead inhabit separate worlds, which will never interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. These "separate worlds" arise from **environmental decoherence**: when a quantum object in superposition becomes entangled with its environment (e.g., air molecules, photons), it causes the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] of the universe to "branch," essentially splitting the universe into slightly different copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

In a more realistic account of Schrödinger's cat:
1.  The radioactive atom evolves into a superposition of decayed and not-decayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
2.  The detector becomes entangled with this superposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
3.  The detector, interacting with its environment (air molecules, photons), decoheres, branching the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
4.  At that moment, the observer (and the cat) are split into two identical copies, each entangled with one outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. When the box is opened, each observer copy finds the cat in a definite state (alive or dead), unaware that the other outcome also happened to a different copy of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

This [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds Interpretation]] suggests that the branching of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] happens constantly, potentially infinitely often, creating infinite subtly different worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This seemingly implausible idea is a natural consequence of the mathematics of [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] if the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] collapse is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The experience of reality would be the same as in the collapse picture, but the [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds]] formalism is considered cleaner and more elegant, relying only on [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave functions]] evolving under the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

In this view, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] is the complete picture of reality, and our measurement is just the part we become entangled with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The universe becomes deterministic again, as every outcome happens 100% of the time; we only experience a single "sliver" of the multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### Common Questions and Objections to Many Worlds

*   **Energy Conservation:** The total energy of the whole [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] is 100% conserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The branching subdivides the universe's energy into different pieces, but the overall energy remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Branching:** Branching occurs whenever a quantum system in superposition becomes entangled with its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. For example, radioactive decays in one's body (around 5000 times per second) cause branching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Whether it's infinitely often or finite depends on unknowns about quantum gravity and cosmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **"Everything that could possibly happen happens":** This is a [[misconceptions_in_classical_paths_versus_quantum_paths | misconception]]. The [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds Interpretation]] simply states that the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] obeys the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] predicts what *could* potentially happen, not *everything*. For example, an electron will not convert into a proton because it violates conservation laws, and the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] gives zero probability to such events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. While low-probability events (like a version of oneself becoming president) can happen in some branches, they are very low amplitude worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Instantaneous Branching:** The concept of branching, and whether it happens instantly across space or spreads at the speed of light, is a human convenience for description, not an intrinsic part of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. The underlying reality is the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] of the universe, and different descriptions yield the same predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This is analogous to describing air in a room by temperature and pressure rather than listing every molecule's position and velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

While [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] is one of the most important materials in the world, enabling much large-scale infrastructure, its production has significant environmental impacts, primarily through carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

## Carbon Emissions from Production

The creation of [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]], the "glue" that binds concrete, releases substantial amounts of CO2. Even in primitive cement production, heating limestone to around 1,000 degrees Celsius drives off CO2 from the rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Modern [[chemical_composition_and_properties_of_concrete | concrete]] production is estimated to contribute about 8% of the global total CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. This amount is more than the entire aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

## Origin of Raw Materials

The core component of [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]] and [[chemical_composition_and_properties_of_concrete | concrete]], limestone, originates from ancient sea life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Limestone is formed from the compressed skeletons and shells of marine organisms that died millions of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This means that significant portions of modern infrastructure, such as skyscrapers and overpasses, are effectively made from ancient marine life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

## Addressing the Impact

Efforts to mitigate the environmental impact of [[chemical_composition_and_properties_of_concrete | concrete]] production involve both individual and systemic actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. While individual actions like changing light bulbs or installing solar panels are beneficial, large-scale systemic change is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

Organizations like Wren aim to help individuals calculate and offset their carbon footprints by funding diverse carbon reduction projects, including:
*   Tree planting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>
*   Mineral weathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>
*   Rainforest protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>

Additionally, these organizations support policy groups, such as the Clean Air Task Force, which advocate for new technologies and policies to achieve a zero-emissions economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

The [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] describes the phenomenon where a spinning object moving through a fluid experiences a force perpendicular to both its direction of motion and its axis of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This effect was notably demonstrated by dropping a basketball from the Gordon Dam in Tasmania, which stands at 126.5 meters (415 feet) high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Experimental Observation

When a basketball was simply dropped from the dam's edge, it was slightly influenced by the breeze but ultimately landed almost directly below its drop point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. However, when another basketball was dropped with a bit of backspin, it dramatically veered away from its initial trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The person who dropped it noted that they "literally just dropped it, with a bit of spin, like I didn't even throw it, and it just took off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This unexpected deviation was due to the [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## How the Magnus Effect Works

The [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] occurs as a rotating ball picks up speed through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   On one side of the ball, the air moves in the same direction as the ball's spin. This air is dragged along with the ball and deflected backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   On the opposite side, the air moves against the direction of the ball's spin. Here, the airflow separates from the ball rather than being deflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The net result is that the ball pushes air in one direction, and in accordance with Newton's third law, the air applies an equal and opposite force on the ball, causing it to move in the other direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Historical Context

The effect is named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus, who provided a description of it in 1852 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, Isaac Newton had described the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College nearly two centuries earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Applications Beyond Sports

While the [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] is crucial in various sports like tennis, soccer, and golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, it also has [[non_sport_applications_of_the_magnus_effect | non-sport applications]].
*   **Flettner Rotors**: Some sailboats utilize spinning cylinders known as "Flettner rotors" instead of traditional sails. These rotors harness the [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] to deflect crosswinds and propel the ship forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. For example, the E-Ship 1 employs four Flettner rotors to enhance efficiency and reduce diesel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Aircraft Design**: Experimental aircraft have been designed with spinning cylinders instead of wings. These cylinders can generate more lift than conventional wings using the [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]], though they also create significantly more drag, making them largely impractical in their initial forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Despite early failures, the [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] is making a comeback in experimental rotor wing aircraft that generate all their lift from spinning cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The [[magnus_effect_in_sports | Magnus effect]] demonstrates its potential to influence various fields, extending its utility beyond just basketballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

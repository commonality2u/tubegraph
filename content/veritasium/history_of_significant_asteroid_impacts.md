Asteroids, the leftover debris from the formation of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago, pose a significant threat to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35">[02:35]</a>. While most asteroids orbit the sun in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06">[04:06]</a>, some, known as [[Nearearth objects and their detection difficulties | Near Earth Objects]] (NEOs), have orbits that bring them closer to our planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18">[04:18]</a>. The physicist Stephen Hawking once considered an asteroid impact the greatest threat to life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26">[04:26]</a>.

## The [[Chelyabinsk asteroid event | Chelyabinsk Asteroid Event]] (2013)

On February 15, 2013, an asteroid heavier than the Eiffel Tower struck Earth's atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15">[00:15]</a>. This asteroid, approximately 20 meters in diameter, which is about the width of two school buses, exploded 30 kilometers above the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24">[00:24]</a>. The explosion was brighter than the sun but silent initially due to its high altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28">[00:28]</a>. The shockwave hit 90 seconds after the blast, causing devastation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35">[00:35]</a>.

Many people looked out their windows after seeing the bright flash and smoke trail, resulting in 1,500 injuries from glass, and thousands of buildings were damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52">[00:52]</a>. What makes this event particularly notable is that on the same day, scientists had predicted a close fly-by of a different, similarly sized asteroid named Duende, which passed within 27,000 kilometers of Earth 16 hours after the Chelyabinsk event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08">[01:08]</a>. However, the Chelyabinsk asteroid was completely missed by detection efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36">[01:36]</a>.

### Detection Difficulties

Missing asteroids like Chelyabinsk is not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41">[01:41]</a>. Since 1988, over 1,200 asteroids larger than a meter have collided with Earth, but only five were detected before impact, none with more than a day's warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49">[01:49]</a>.

Several factors contribute to these detection challenges:
*   **Size and Darkness** Asteroids range from meters to kilometers in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>. They are rough and dark, reflecting only about 15% of the light that hits them, making them difficult to spot in the vastness of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19">[05:19]</a>.
*   **Observation Method** Most are found by ground-based telescopes looking for moving dots in sequential pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39">[04:39]</a>.
*   **Opposition Effect** The best chance to see asteroids is when they are fully illuminated by the sun, meaning over 85% of detected NEOs are found in the 45 degrees of sky directly opposite the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26">[05:26]</a>. This "opposition effect" implies that many asteroids approaching from the direction of the sun, like Chelyabinsk, remain undetected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41">[05:41]</a>.
*   **Orbital Prediction Limits** Even once detected, predicting an asteroid's precise path years into the future is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22">[06:22]</a>. Planetary gravity can significantly alter orbits, leading to "dynamical chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54">[06:54]</a>. Current predictions are only accurate for about 100 years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12">[07:12]</a>.

## Past Major [[Impact of asteroids on Earth | Asteroid Impacts]] and Their Consequences

### The Barringer Crater Impact

The Barringer Crater in Arizona is a well-known site of an ancient asteroid impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33">[07:33]</a>. For many years, it was believed to be volcanic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44">[07:44]</a>. Mining engineer Daniel Barringer, however, was the first to suggest it was formed by a meteorite impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36">[07:36]</a>. He spent 27 years drilling for the metallic meteorite, believing it was worth a fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56">[07:56]</a>.

However, Barringer was unaware that the 50-meter iron asteroid that created the crater 50,000 years ago had entirely vaporized upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22">[09:22]</a>. At high speeds (around 30 kilometers per second), the kinetic energy of an impact is so immense that it completely vaporizes the projectile, turning it into a superheated, high-pressure gas that causes an explosion and blows out the crater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39">[08:39]</a>. This 50-meter asteroid released energy equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT, over 600 times the energy of the Hiroshima bomb, demonstrating that an impact closely resembles a large nuclear explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39">[09:39]</a>.

### The Dinosaur Extinction Event

About 65 million years ago, a 10-kilometer asteroid struck Earth, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16">[10:16]</a>. Asteroids above a critical size (a couple of kilometers) deliver enough energy to have global effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23">[10:23]</a>. The impact launched a massive amount of debris into sub-orbital trajectories, which then fell back to Earth globally, including on the opposite side of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39">[10:39]</a>.

This created a sky full of meteors, turning the atmosphere into a "red, hot glow," effectively cooking everything on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53">[10:53]</a>. Only animals living underground or in water had a chance of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30">[11:30]</a>.

## Future Risk and Current Capabilities

The probability of a 10-kilometer asteroid impact like the one that caused the KT extinction event is about one in a hundred million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57">[11:57]</a>. Fortunately, scientists have identified no 10-kilometer impactors with a path intersecting Earth for the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12">[12:12]</a>.

However, there are exponentially more asteroids of smaller sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33">[12:33]</a>. While 90-98% of 1-2 kilometer asteroids have been identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17">[13:17]</a>, these are still capable of causing massive regional damage, enough to obliterate a country the size of France or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49">[12:49]</a>.

The greatest remaining threat comes from asteroids a few hundred meters in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46">[13:46]</a>. These are large enough to obliterate a major city, causing widespread destruction, city-wide fires, and high-speed ejecta that would devastate a 100-kilometer zone around the impact site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57">[13:57]</a>. Many of these have not yet been detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53">[13:53]</a>.

### Limited Deflection Strategies

Current capabilities for [[Current and potential asteroid deflection strategies | asteroid deflection strategies]] are extremely limited:
*   **Bombing:** Bombing an asteroid is not guaranteed to work as it might just break into fragments that gravity could pull back together into a "rubble pile," especially if it's already one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48">[14:48]</a>.
*   **Nudging with Rockets:** Attaching rockets to gently push an asteroid off course would require centuries of sustained thrust from rockets far more powerful than currently exist, and the ability to keep them attached to a rotating body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22">[15:22]</a>.
*   **Ablation with Lasers:** Boiling the surface of an asteroid with lasers to change its trajectory requires lasers far more powerful than we can currently create, and they would need to be brought to the object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53">[15:53]</a>.
*   **Wrapping in Foil:** The idea of wrapping an asteroid in reflective foil to alter its radiative properties (and thus its movement) is impractical due to the massive amount of foil required and the difficulty of deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06">[16:06]</a>.

In truth, there is currently no way to deflect a kilometer-sized asteroid, let alone a 10-kilometer one, which would be "a thousand times more hopeless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26">[16:26]</a>.

### Evacuation Challenges

Even the most hopeful strategy—evacuating a city if an impact location is known—is fraught with difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52">[16:52]</a>. Historical examples of city evacuations, even with a week's warning for hurricanes, show that freeways quickly become blocked when millions of people attempt to leave simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58">[16:58]</a>.

Given these limitations, the most feasible approach is to continue building telescopes and conducting surveys to detect and track asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50">[17:50]</a>. By understanding the threat, humanity can then focus efforts on developing specific deflection strategies for particular dangerous objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04">[18:04]</a>.

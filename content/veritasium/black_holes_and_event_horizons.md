## The Appearance of a Black Hole

From an external observer's perspective, an object approaching a black hole would appear to slow down as it gets closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its time would appear to be slowing down, and at the exact moment it should cross the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]], it would seem to stop, frozen in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The light emitted from the object would become dimmer and redder until it completely fades from view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This phenomenon is due to extreme [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | redshift]], meaning the light is still coming from the point where the object "crossed," but it is too redshifted to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

In theory, if one could see that redshifted light, one would see everything that has ever fallen into the black hole, frozen on its horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, in practice, photons are emitted at discrete intervals, so a last photon is emitted outside the horizon, causing these images to fade after some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## General Relativity and Spacetime Curvature

The unusual behavior observed around black holes is one of the "strange results" of the general theory of relativity, which is our current best theory of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Developed by Albert Einstein, general relativity resolves a fundamental flaw in Newtonian gravity, which struggled to explain how masses could exert force on each other across vast distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Einstein's theory posits that instead of direct forces, a mass like the Sun curves the spacetime in its immediate vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This curvature then affects other masses, such as the Earth orbiting the Sun because the spacetime it's passing through is curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This concept eliminates the need for "action at a distance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Mathematically, this is described by Einstein's field equations. These equations relate the distribution of matter and energy to the resultant curvature of spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. They are a family of coupled differential equations, making them complex to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Spacetime Diagrams

To understand spacetime and solutions to Einstein's equations, the concept of light cones is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. A future light cone represents all possible events that can happen to an observer in the future, as nothing can travel faster than light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Conversely, a past light cone defines all events in the past that could have affected the observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. In a spacetime diagram, light rays are conventionally depicted traveling at 45 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. In flat spacetime, a formula called the spacetime interval is used to measure distances between events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. However, around a mass, spacetime is curved, requiring modifications to this equation to account for the geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Schwarzschild Solution

The first non-trivial solution to Einstein's equations was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. He simplified the scenario to an eternal, static universe containing only a single, spherically symmetric, electrically neutral, and non-rotating point mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The resulting [[schwarzschild_solution_and_singularities | Schwarzschild metric]] describes how spacetime curves outside of such a mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. It shows that spacetime becomes increasingly curved closer to the mass, attracting objects and causing time to run slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Initially, two "problem spots" were noticed in Schwarzschild's solution:
*   **Singularity at r=0**: At the very center of the mass, the equation blows up to infinity, meaning it cannot describe what is physically happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This is known as a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Apparent Singularity at the Schwarzschild Radius**: At a specific distance from the center, known as the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | Schwarzschild radius]], another term in the equation "blows up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. At this radius, the spacetime curvature becomes so steep that the escape velocity—the speed needed for anything to leave—is the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This implies that nothing, not even light, could escape from within this radius, forming a dark object that swallows matter and light—a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Formation of Black Holes

Most scientists initially doubted the existence of black holes because it seemed to require too much mass collapsing into too tiny a space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Astronomers were studying what happens at the end of a star's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. When a star's nuclear fuel runs out, the outward radiation pressure that balances gravity drops, causing the star material to collapse inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Initially, mechanisms like "electron degeneracy pressure" (based on Pauli's exclusion principle and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) were proposed to prevent complete collapse, leading to the formation of white dwarfs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. However, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar demonstrated that electron degeneracy pressure has limits (the Chandrasekhar limit), beyond which it cannot support a star against collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Later, "neutron degeneracy pressure" was identified as a stronger force, leading to the formation of neutron stars for heavier stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Yet, even neutron stars have a maximum mass, discovered by Jay Robert Oppenheimer and George Volkoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder subsequently showed that for the heaviest stars, there is nothing left to prevent their indefinite contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This theoretical prediction solidified the idea that black holes could indeed form.

## Resolution of the Event Horizon Singularity

Einstein himself struggled with the idea that time freezes at the horizon, suggesting nothing could ever enter a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Oppenheimer offered a key insight: while an outside observer would never see anything go in, an object traveling across the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]] would not notice anything unusual and would pass through without knowing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

The apparent singularity at the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]] in the [[schwarzschild_solution_and_singularities | Schwarzschild solution]] was later understood to be a "poor choice of coordinate system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. By choosing a different coordinate system, this singularity disappears, confirming that objects can indeed cross into the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

One analogy to visualize this is describing space as flowing towards the black hole like a waterfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Closer to the black hole, space flows faster. Photons emitted by an approaching object must "swim" against this flow. Just outside the horizon, photons can barely make it out, but it takes longer and longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. At the horizon, space falls inwards as fast as photons can swim, meaning photons either eventually escape or fall in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Inside the horizon, space falls faster than the speed of light, ensuring everything falls into the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

## Rotating Black Holes (Kerr Solution)

While the [[schwarzschild_solution_and_singularities | Schwarzschild solution]] describes a non-rotating black hole, every star rotates, implying that every black hole must also rotate due to angular momentum conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. Solving Einstein's equations for a spinning mass proved much harder, taking 40 years until Roy Kerr found the solution in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

The Kerr solution introduces several dramatic changes:
*   **Layered Structure**: A rotating black hole consists of several layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
*   **Non-Spherical Symmetry**: Rotation causes the black hole to bulge around its equator, making it symmetric only about its axis of spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Ergosphere**: Space gets dragged around with the rotating black hole, taking particles along with it. Closer in, space is dragged faster, eventually exceeding the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. This region, called the ergosphere, makes it impossible to stay still relative to distant stars, though one can still escape the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Outer Horizon**: This is the "point of no return," similar to the Schwarzschild event horizon, where one can only go inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Inner Event Horizon**: Inside the outer horizon, another region allows for free movement, where one is not necessarily doomed to the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Ring Singularity**: Unlike the point singularity in a non-rotating black hole, the singularity in a rotating black hole expands out to be a ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. It is theorized that one could fly through this ring singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

## Theoretical Implications: White Holes, Wormholes, and Parallel Universes

Penrose diagrams, which map infinite spacetime onto a single finite diagram (where light rays always travel at 45 degrees), are particularly useful for visualizing the full extent of black hole solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. When extending the [[schwarzschild_solution_and_singularities | Schwarzschild solution]] to its "maximal extension" using these diagrams:
*   **White Holes**: A new region appears where things can come out but never go in, the opposite of a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. This is known as a white hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. White holes are considered the time-reversed picture of black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.
*   **Parallel Universes**: The solution implies the existence of a whole new universe, parallel to our own, connected through the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Einstein-Rosen Bridge (Wormhole)**: The point where these regions cross signifies an Einstein-Rosen Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>, a theoretical "wormhole" that connects the space of both universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

For a rotating black hole, the Penrose diagram shows how the singularity lifts and moves to the sides, revealing a new region inside the inner horizon where one can move freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Venturing further could lead to a white hole that pushes you into another universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. By aiming for the center of the ring singularity, one might even find an "anti-verse" where gravity pushes instead of pulls, or return to a universe with normal gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

## Reality of These Concepts

While these theoretical extensions are mathematically consistent with Einstein's general relativity, their existence in reality is highly debated:
*   **Eternal Solutions**: Both the extended [[schwarzschild_solution_and_singularities | Schwarzschild]] and Kerr solutions describe eternal black holes in an empty universe, lacking a formation mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. This is one reason why black holes are believed to exist, but white holes are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.
*   **Inner Horizon Singularity**: For the maximally extended Kerr solution, an "infinite flux of energy" can pile up along the inner horizon, creating its own singularity and effectively sealing off the ring singularity and any beyond-universe connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. This suggests that the exotic elements of rotating black holes might not be physically traversable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.
*   **Exotic Matter for Wormholes**: Traversable wormholes (those with no horizons, stable in time, and constructible) would require an exotic kind of matter with negative energy density to prevent them from collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. Such matter is believed to be against the laws of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

According to our current best understanding, it is likely that white holes, traversable wormholes, and parallel universes connected via these mechanisms do not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. However, scientists once thought black holes didn't exist either, leaving open the possibility of future surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

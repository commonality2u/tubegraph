The Citicorp Center, opened in 1977, was initially hailed as an engineering marvel and an "acrobatic act of architecture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Its unique design, driven by specific site constraints and an innovative structural engineer, ultimately led to a critical re-evaluation of building codes and the adoption of advanced engineering solutions worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

## Architectural Innovation and Design Challenges
In the 1960s, financial giant Citicorp sought a new Manhattan headquarters on a city block that included Saint Peter's church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The church pastor, Ralph Peterson, insisted the church remain on its exact spot, be physically distinct and independent from the new tower, and have two-thirds of the space above it remain open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Architect Hugh Stubbins and structural engineer Bill LeMessurier were hired to address these constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. To maximize floor area while accommodating the church, LeMessurier proposed an unprecedented design: constructing the skyscraper on stilts, not just by notching one corner, but all four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This was a radical idea, making the engineer's job harder but satisfying the architectural requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The stilts were positioned at the center of each face of the building, rather than the corners, creating an inherent engineering problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. LeMessurier's solution was a unique system of six layers of diagonal braces, or chevrons, up each face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. These chevrons transferred both gravity and wind loads to the mid-face stilts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. By removing columns at the top and middle of each chevron, every eight stories acted as a separate unit, forcing half the gravity load through the chevrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This unique structural system was driven by the specific conditions of the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Integration of a Tuned Mass Damper
Due to its light construction, the building was prone to swaying in the wind, which, while not a structural issue, could be uncomfortable for occupants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. LeMessurier's elegant solution was the world's first [[tuned_mass_dampers_in_skyscraper_engineering | tuned mass damper (TMD)]] in a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This system, previously used in bridges and ships, involved a 400-ton concrete block on the top floor that would oscillate out of phase with the building's motion, dissipating kinetic energy through viscous dampers and reducing sway by approximately 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This saved about $4 million by reducing the need for additional structural steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## The Flaw and Its Impact
The flaw was discovered when LeMessurier learned that his firm had agreed to use bolts instead of welds to connect the chevron braces, saving a quarter of a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. His team had calculated bolt requirements based on straight-on wind loads, not considering "quartering winds" â€“ winds hitting the building's corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

When LeMessurier performed calculations for quartering winds, he found that the forces on some braces were 40% higher than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Crucially, his firm also used an incorrect factor of safety for these "minor structural elements," underestimating the tension in the braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The weakest joints on the 30th floor, which needed 14 bolts, had only four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Dynamic analysis further revealed that stresses could increase by up to 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. If the [[tuned_mass_dampers_in_skyscraper_engineering | tuned mass damper]] lost power, 110 kilometer per hour winds for just five minutes could cause collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

### Emergency Repairs and Public Reaction
LeMessurier's decision to reveal and fix the flaw, known as Project Serene, demonstrated exceptional [[engineering_ethics_and_bill_lemessuriers_response | engineering ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. The repairs, costing $4 to $5 million, involved welders secretly reinforcing over 200 joints with steel plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. A potential mass panic was averted partly due to a newspaper strike that blacked out press coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

## Legacy and Influence on Building Regulations and Architecture
For almost two decades, the secret of Citicorp's near-catastrophe remained confined to a small group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. However, when *The New Yorker* brought Project Serene to light in 1995, LeMessurier was praised for his integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

The Citicorp case had a profound impact on building regulations and the field of architecture and engineering:
*   **Building Code Updates** After the article, New York updated its building code to specifically require calculations for quartering winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. This ensures that future designs account for a broader range of wind loads, a lesson learned directly from the Citicorp flaw.
*   **Wider Adoption of Tuned Mass Dampers** Since the first TMD in Citicorp, these systems have become widespread globally, enabling architects to design taller and slimmer skyscrapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. Six of the 20 tallest buildings in the world now include TMDs, especially critical in typhoon or earthquake-prone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. For example, Taipei 101 uses a 660-ton pendulum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. LeMessurier himself became known as the "father of the tuned mass damper" in Japan, where the technology is ubiquitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.
*   **Case Study in Engineering Ethics** The Citicorp case is taught worldwide as a prime example of [[engineering_ethics_and_bill_lemessuriers_response | good engineering ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. It highlights the responsibility of engineers to prioritize public safety, even when it means admitting mistakes and risking professional ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. This reinforced the principle that professionals have a responsibility beyond themselves, especially when a social risk could "kill thousands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

Despite its ongoing controversies, such as the mysterious student who first raised concerns about the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>, the Citicorp Center's story remains a pivotal moment in architectural and structural engineering history, demonstrating how a near-disaster can lead to significant advancements in safety and design practices.

The term IQ is prevalent in popular culture, often understood as an objective and rigorous measurement of intellectual ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article explores what IQ tests claim to measure, what they can predict about an individual's life, and the nuances of these predictions.

## What IQ Tests Aim to Measure

The concept of intelligence testing dates back hundreds of years, with a significant breakthrough occurring in 1904 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. English psychologist Charles Spearman observed a clear positive correlation between students' grades in different subjects, such as math and English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Students who performed well in one subject tended to perform well in all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Spearman proposed that this correlation could be explained by a "general intelligence" factor, or *g-factor*, which captures how quickly students learn new material, recognize patterns, and think critically across subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. He also suggested *subject-specific factors*, or *s-factors*, which account for the imperfect correlations in performance across subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. While s-factors could be trained, Spearman believed general intelligence was fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

The world's first [[history_of_iq_tests | IQ test]], the Binet-Simon test, was developed by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon in France to identify children needing more help in school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This test assigned a "mental age" based on performance relative to other students, which was then used to calculate an "intelligence quotient" (IQ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The Stanford-Binet test, a standardized version, became widely used in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Modern [[what_iq_tests_actually_measure | IQ tests]] assess various mental abilities like memory, verbal, spatial, and [[the_psychology_of_numbers | numerical skills]], aiming to approximate the g-factor by averaging scores across distinct tasks to minimize subject-specific distortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Scores are normalized, typically with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This means 68% of people have an IQ between 85 and 115, and only about 2% score above 130 or below 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## What IQ Can Predict

IQ tests, despite their brevity, show a surprising ability to predict various life outcomes:

*   **Brain Size**
    *   A 2005 meta-analysis estimated a correlation of 0.33 between IQ and brain size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **School Success**
    *   A 2007 study in Scotland measured the IQs of 13,000 11-year-olds and found a correlation of about 0.8 with their national school examination scores five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This means about two-thirds of the variation in exam scores could be predicted by IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
    *   IQ is a good predictor of how much schooling a person will complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
    *   Tests like the SAT, ACT, and GRE correlate with standard IQ tests at around 0.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Job Success**
    *   One of the most robust findings is that IQ predicts job success, particularly in technical or high-complexity jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
    *   Correlations typically range from 0.2 to 0.6, with the highest effect seen in military training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
    *   The U.S. military does not accept anyone with an IQ under 80 and limits recruits with IQs between 81 and 92 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. During the Vietnam War, relaxing these requirements led to recruits below the threshold being 1.5 to 3 times more likely to fail training and requiring 3 to 9 times more remedial training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. This led to increased strain and a three times higher fatality rate for these recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Longevity**
    *   A Scottish study found that for every 15-point increase in IQ at age 11, individuals were 27% more likely to be alive at age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
    *   A large meta-analysis confirmed that higher IQs correlate with a lower risk of dying within the study timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Income**
    *   Studies show a tendency for income to increase with IQ, with a correlation coefficient of 0.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
    *   However, the variance is huge; a large meta-analysis found the correlation between IQ and income to be 0.21, explaining only 4.4% of the variance in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This might be because intelligence isn't always highly rewarded financially, or highly intelligent people may prioritize interests other than accumulating money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Net Worth**
    *   The relationship with net worth is even weaker, hardly correlating with IQ, suggesting higher IQ doesn't necessarily translate into better saving or wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## Nuances and Limitations in Prediction

Despite its predictive power, [[controversies_and_criticisms_of_iq_tests | IQ tests]] and the g-factor concept have significant limitations and [[what_iq_tests_actually_measure | nuances]]:

*   **Stability over Lifetime and Genetic Basis**
    *   IQ appears fairly consistent over one's lifetime, with scores 80 years apart correlating at 0.5 to 0.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
    *   There is evidence for a genetic basis; identical twins show a strong correlation in IQ scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
    *   However, IQ is not entirely determined by genetics; twin studies suggest it's about 50/50 heritability and environment across the lifespan, though estimates range from 40% to 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Not Completely Fixed**
    *   Education can improve IQ, indicating it's not completely fixed over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
    *   Intelligence might also be comprised of multiple constructs, such as fluid intelligence (ability to learn and solve novel problems) and crystallized intelligence (accumulated knowledge), which peak at different ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Environmental Influences**
    *   The "Flynn Effect" demonstrates that average IQ scores have increased by about two to three points per decade over the last century, totaling around a 30-point increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. This is attributed to factors like improved childhood nutrition and health, better [[impacts_of_education_and_culture_on_iq | education]], and a societal shift from manual labor to abstract thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
    *   IQ tests do not objectively measure intelligence independent of culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. So-called "culture fair" tests are impossible to construct because cultures differ in basic concepts like words for shapes or spatial relations, influencing how people think about and use categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. They also fail to assess forms of intelligence vital for survival in other cultures, such as ethnobotanical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.
*   **Other Factors Affecting Score**
    *   **Motivation**: Incentivizing test-takers with money can increase IQ scores by up to 20 points, especially for those with below-average IQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
    *   **Training and Coaching**: Familiarity with IQ-style questions and specific strategies can boost scores by up to eight points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
    *   **Test-Taking Strategy**: Knowing when to skip questions, eliminate wrong answers, and guess impacts performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
    *   **Anxiety**: A small amount of anxiety can be beneficial, but too much negatively impacts performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

## Modern Applications and Perspectives

Despite the [[controversies_and_criticisms_of_iq_tests | controversies and criticisms of IQ tests]], particularly regarding their misuse in the American eugenics movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, IQ tests still have relevant modern applications:

*   **Forensic Neuroscience**: IQ tests are used in legal cases, such as the Atkins defense, which eliminates the death penalty for individuals with intellectual disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. Measures are embedded in tests to detect attempts to fake poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Enhancement**: Boosting cognitive ability early in life could delay the onset of functional problems in old age due to cognitive decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
*   **Identifying Talent**: IQ tests can identify individuals with strong intellectual abilities who might not otherwise demonstrate them in traditional settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. Using standardized IQ tests for gifted programs, rather than relying solely on teacher opinions, can lead to a higher proportion of poorer and minority students being identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. The initial motivation for such tests was to reduce social biases in educational access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

Psychologists and the public often have a "love-hate relationship" with intelligence and IQ scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Extremist views on both sides—those who believe IQ is paramount and those who believe it's entirely useless and a tool of prejudice—are unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. A more moderate view is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

It is crucial to understand that IQ does not determine someone's worth; how an individual interacts with and helps others is far more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. While IQ can predict certain outcomes, it doesn't entirely dictate a person's life trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. Individuals can significantly improve their outcomes by building knowledge and analytical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. The only aspect of personality that correlates with IQ is openness to experience, suggesting that a willingness to try new things leads to more learning and increased intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

Researchers employ specific experiments to understand [[spider_response_to_visual_stimuli | spider]] visual perception, particularly their ability to discriminate colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Experimental Setup

The theory behind the experiment is to display a moving shape on a screen that differs from the background only in color, not in brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective is to observe if the spider attempts to follow the shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Challenges and Control

A challenge in studying [[jumping_spider_behavior | jumping spiders]] is that they will naturally turn and respond to visual stimuli, which alters their visual field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. To maintain [[control_of_spider_movement_in_experiments | control over what the spiders see]], researchers hold them in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This is achieved by attaching tiny [[use_of_magnets_in_spider_research | magnets]] to their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Monitoring Movement Intent

While held in place, spiders are given a ball to stand on, which they grasp with their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Researchers monitor the movement of this ball under their feet to determine where the spider intends to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For example, if a spider rotates the ball to the left, it likely indicates an attempt to look to the right to follow the moving shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This observed behavior serves as evidence that the [[spider_response_to_visual_stimuli | spider]] can differentiate between the colors of the moving shape and its background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

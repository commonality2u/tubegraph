The world's strongest magnet is located at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Since the year 2000, this facility has held the Guinness World Record for the strongest continuous magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The magnet is capable of drawing objects in, generating electric current, and levitating non-magnetic items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its powerful [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic fields]] make it incredibly difficult to film due to interference with camera equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Magnetic Field Strength

For context, Earth's [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]] is approximately 0.00005 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. A typical fridge magnet is around 0.01 Tesla, and MRI machines can reach up to three Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This electromagnet, however, creates a [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]] of 45 Tesla, which is nearly a million times stronger than Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The extreme strength of the magnet has led to incidents, such as a chair being accelerated across a room and having its components pulled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Construction and Operation

To achieve such a powerful field, the magnet is a hybrid system consisting of an outer [[Superconducting and resistive magnets | superconducting magnet]] and an inner [[Superconducting and resistive magnets | resistive magnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The apparatus is two stories tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The maximum field, or field center, occurs within a narrow cylinder running through its middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, specifically about a centimeter tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This small, intense region is where users conduct experiments on very small samples, such as computer or cell phone chips, for material science and kinetic matter research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Ramping the magnet up to full power takes about an hour and a half, requiring 47,000 amps of current at 500 volts into the outer [[Superconducting and resistive magnets | superconducting electromagnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### The Fringe Field

Although the direct center of the magnet is inaccessible for filming, experiments can be conducted in the "fringe field" that extends above and around the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While much weaker than 45 Tesla, the fringe field remains considerably dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The size of the fringe field depends on the bore's dimensions in a [[Superconducting and resistive magnets | superconducting magnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. At the 100 Gauss line within the fringe field, objects with shapes will start to orient themselves to the field, and if they get too close, they can be violently pulled in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Consequently, no ferromagnetic objects or metallic implants are permitted within this 100 Gauss line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Interaction with Materials

### Ferromagnetic Materials

Materials that are attracted to [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic fields]] are known as ferromagnetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Examples include iron, nickel, and cobalt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

*   **Nerf Football**: A Nerf football with steel washers placed inside clearly showed attraction to the magnet, unlike an unmodified one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. When thrown, it would stick to the side of the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Ferrofluid**: Ferrofluid, which contains nanoscale magnetite particles suspended in solution, demonstrates this attraction vividly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. In an external [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]], these particles align like iron filings around a bar magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Even meters away, the ferrofluid developed parallel ridges, forming spikes and climbing the vessel as it got closer to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

The word "magnet" originates from "Magnesia," a part of Greece where naturally magnetized pieces of magnetite, also called lodestones, were discovered over 3000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. By the 11th century in China, it was recognized that magnets could be used to create compass needles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Ferromagnetism occurs because elements with half-full outer electron shells have unpaired electrons that act as tiny magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For a bulk material to be magnetic, these atomic magnetic fields must align within domains, and all domains must align with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This alignment can be achieved by applying a strong external [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]], effectively turning a non-magnetic ferromagnetic material into a permanent magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Non-Ferromagnetic Conductive Materials (Eddy Currents & Lenz's Law)

The behavior of non-ferromagnetic materials in a strong [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]] can be surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Materials that conduct electricity fall significantly slower when moving through the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

This phenomenon is explained by **Lenz's Law** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. As a metal plate falls through the [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]], the changing number of magnetic field lines (magnetic flux) induces electric currents, called eddy currents, within the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. These eddy currents generate their own [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]] that opposes the change in flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. For example, if a plate falls towards a north magnetic pole, the induced currents create a north magnetic pole, repelling the plate and slowing its descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

*   **Falling Plates**: A large metal plate visibly warms up as it falls through the field due to the energy dissipated as heat by the eddy currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. An electromagnetic levitator in Paris illustrates this, boiling water on a levitated plate due to intense heat generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Opposing Movement**: Lenz's Law dictates that any attempt to move the conductive material in the field is opposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. If one tries to pick up the plate, a south magnetic pole is induced, attracting it back to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Similarly, an aluminum cylinder refuses to roll across the top of the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Potato Cannon Projectiles**: Firing aluminum projectiles from a potato cannon across the magnet demonstrates significant deceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. As the projectile enters the [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]], induced eddy currents rotate it to align with the magnetic field lines, minimizing flux change and slowing it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Projectiles containing coils of wire connected to LEDs lit up, showcasing the changing induced currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

In all these cases, the induced electrical energy is dissipated as light or heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### Superconductors and Levitation

If a material like a superconductor, below its critical temperature, does not dissipate energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>:
*   It has zero electrical resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   When a magnet is brought close, currents are induced to oppose the change in flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   These currents persist indefinitely and expel all [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]] from the material (Meissner effect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

However, some superconductors have non-superconducting filaments or engineered defects that trap magnetic field lines, preventing them from moving freely. This phenomenon is known as flux pinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

*   **Human Levitator**: The lab features a human levitator, where a 90-pound (40 kg) magnet hovers above a ring of superconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. When a person stands on the magnet, pushing it towards the superconductors, the induced currents in the superconductors create a repulsive [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]], causing the magnet and person to levitate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

### [[Magnetism in nonferromagnetic materials | Magnetism in Nonferromagnetic Materials]] (Para- and Diamagnetism)

All materials possess [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic properties]], but they are usually only discernible in strong [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic fields]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

*   **Paramagnetism**: Some materials are always attracted to [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic fields]], regardless of pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This is paramagnetism. Liquid oxygen is a paramagnetic example; it is visibly attracted to a magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The presence of the external field strengthens the material's overall [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]], causing attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Diamagnetism**: Most materials, including water, are repelled by a strong enough [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]] (either north or south pole) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This is diamagnetism. In an external field, water molecules effectively become opposing magnets and are repelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This repulsion can be used to levitate objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Strawberries and raspberries, being mostly water, can be levitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Living organisms, which contain significant amounts of water, can also be levitated; frogs, grasshoppers, and even mice have been levitated in experiments to study the effects of weightlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

While there are no lasting or long-term effects on living things from strong [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic fields]], it has been observed that the stones in the inner ear can become polarized, causing rodents to spin in circles for a few minutes after exiting the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

## The Engineering Behind the Strongest Magnet

Building the world's strongest magnet requires combining different technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. [[Superconducting and resistive magnets | Superconducting magnets]] alone have a limit of approximately 20 Tesla, as they cease to be superconducting above a certain [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]] strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

The solution is a hybrid design:
*   **Outer Superconducting Electromagnet**: This part produces 11.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Inner Resistive Magnet**: This part produces 33.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

When combined, their fields add up to 45 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Ordinary wire-wound electromagnets typically cannot exceed two Tesla because heat cannot be effectively removed from the innermost windings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

To overcome this, the resistive magnet uses a design developed by Francis Bitter in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Instead of round wire, the conductor is flattened into very thin plates, stacked with alternating insulators to form a helix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. This "Bitter plate" design allows cooling water to be pushed axially through the stack, effectively removing heat even from the innermost parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. This enables much higher currents (up to 57,000 amps) to pass through the coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

The coils are stacked, aligned with tie rods, and subjected to about 20 tons of force to hold them together and ensure electrical connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. Thousands of gallons of deionized water per minute are pumped through the coils to keep them from melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

Occasionally, material failure occurs when the metal deforms beyond its elastic limit, shorting to adjacent coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Such failures can be expensive, leading to the vaporization of metal and destruction of multiple coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory holds the record for the highest continuous [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]] in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. China has recently commissioned a similar 45 Tesla hybrid magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

## Energy Consumption and Purpose

Running the world's strongest magnets requires a substantial amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. The Mag Lab consumes about 8% of Tallahassee's total electricity generating capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, with an electricity budget of $250,000 to $300,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. They operate within the city's federally mandated reserve, allowing the city to monetize power that would otherwise be unused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. In return, the lab can rapidly ramp down its power consumption when the city needs the reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

The primary purpose of such strong [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic fields]] is to drive material discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This involves:
*   Growing new materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   Placing materials in extreme environments (high [[Magnetic fields and their effects | magnetic field]], high electric field, high pressure, ultralow temperature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
*   Improving the cleanliness of existing materials by removing impurities, which enhances properties and allows for observation of phenomena previously unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

Scientists believe that the current five-year period will be an "inflection point" for what can be achieved with these powerful magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>, suggesting significant future [[applications_and_impacts_of_strong_magnets | applications and impacts of strong magnets]].

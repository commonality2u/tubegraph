The United States government maintains a vast warehouse of substances, many of which are [[standard_reference_materials_and_their_uses | Standard Reference Materials (SRMs)]] used to ensure accuracy and consistency across various industries, particularly in the realm of industrial materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These materials range from steel and limestone to more unusual items like domestic sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Historical Context: Steel Standards

In the early 1900s, specifically around 1905, a significant problem arose concerning the quality of steel used in rail cars, including locomotives and tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. While manufacturers understood the necessary alloy compositions, foundries lacked a consistent method to compare their material results with industry standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

To address this, Congress directed the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST) to develop standard steel samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. These standards involved analyzing steel for all its constituent elements, such as chromium, iron, and carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. These standardized steels were then distributed to foundries, enabling them to compare their products against a known, reliable source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. These steel standards were among NIST's very first products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Modern Industrial Material SRMs

Today, steel continues to be one of the most crucial [[standard_reference_materials_and_their_uses | Standard Reference Materials]] at NIST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Charpy Samples

NIST's best-selling product related to industrial materials are "Charpies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. These are specialized steel samples used to test the material's strength through a method developed by Professor Charpy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

#### The Charpy Test
The Charpy test involves:
*   A pendulum with a weight that is raised to a specific height, allowing its potential energy to be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   A standard piece of metal, known as a Charpy, with a V-notch, held in a vice at the bottom of the pendulum's swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   The pendulum swings through, breaking the Charpy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   The amount of energy required to break the steel sample is then calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

This test is critical because steel is used in vital infrastructure like pipelines, defense industries (e.g., tanks), and containers for nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Consequently, companies in the United States and internationally are required to annually check their materials against NIST's Charpies to ensure appropriate structural and mechanical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. NIST sells approximately 8,000 Charpy units per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### Limestone No. 1

NIST's very first standard sample, Limestone Number One, was produced over 110 years ago and is still being made and sold today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Despite its age, it remains popular, with 40 to 50 units sold annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This longevity highlights the enduring need for fundamental material standards.

## SRMs for Validation

Beyond calibration, some [[standard_reference_materials_and_their_uses | SRMs]] are used for validation, meaning they are directly incorporated into industry tests to ensure consistent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### Standard Cigarettes
One such example is standard cigarettes, which were developed in response to a significant issue of fires started by smoking materials, particularly in homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. These cigarettes, alongside ASTM tests, help manufacturers assess the flammability of materials in furniture, sheets, or mattresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The use of standardized NIST cigarettes ensures consistency in these flammability tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This standardization, coupled with regulations and public education, has significantly contributed to saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Standard Bullet
NIST also sells a standard bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. When a bullet is fired, the rifling in the gun barrel leaves unique marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Forensic labs analyze these grooves to match bullets from crime scenes to suspected weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The standard bullet, which has manufactured nano-indentations replicating these marks, is used by labs to validate their equipment and ensure accurate measurements of bullet grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

The existence of a vast array of [[standard_reference_materials_and_their_uses | Standard Reference Materials]] ensures that our world functions reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. From the structural integrity of steel-framed buildings to the safety of household products, a dedicated group of people at NIST diligently characterizes and verifies these materials, guaranteeing consistency and accuracy across various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

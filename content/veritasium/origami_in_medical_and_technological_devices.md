Engineers are increasingly drawing inspiration from origami for diverse applications, ranging from medical devices to space technology and even protective gear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This ancient art of paper folding provides useful principles for modern [[engineering_applications_of_origami | engineering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Historical Context

Origami, meaning "folding paper," has a history in Japan dating back at least 400 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. While the number of designs was historically limited, a significant expansion occurred in the 20th century, with tens of thousands of patterns documented today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This surge was largely influenced by Japanese origami masters, particularly Akira Yoshizawa, whose work inspired a global renaissance in origami creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Why Origami is Useful in Engineering

The primary utility of origami in [[engineering_applications_of_origami | engineering]] stems from its ability to transform a flat sheet into complex shapes with minimal processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This allows for significant size reduction from a large flat sheet to a compact folded object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Key Benefits for Engineering:
*   **Shape Transformation**: Converts a flat material into a desired three-dimensional form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Compactness and Deployability**: Enables a large structure to be stored compactly and then deployed easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Increased Rigidity**: The act of folding a material can inherently make it more rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, allowing for stronger structures from thinner materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Controlled Motion**: Leverages the flexibility of materials to create specific, functional motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Scalability and Miniaturization**: Principles can be scaled down to create microscopic devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Applications in Medical Devices

Origami principles are being applied to create innovative medical tools, often allowing for smaller incisions and more complex operations inside the body.

### Surgical Catheters
Origami bellows have been developed for flexible catheters used with surgical robots like the Da Vinci system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. These bellows prevent catheters from buckling by maintaining a consistent internal opening, providing continuous support as the catheter is inserted into the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Micro-Gripers for Robotic Surgery
A variant of a mini-gripper, inspired by origami, is now used in robotic surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This device replaces previous mechanisms, reducing the number of parts by 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. It is smaller but offers a wider range of motion, allowing for small incisions that then morph into a gripper for complex tasks inside the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Microscopic Devices and Nano-Injectors
Origami can be miniaturized significantly. The world's smallest origami flapping bird, smaller than a grain of salt, demonstrates techniques for creating microscopic self-folding origami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. While the bird itself has no practical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, this research facilitates the development of microscopic machines for medical applications and implants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. An example is a nano-injector used in gene therapy to deliver DNA to cells, which is only four micrometers thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Applications in Technological Devices

Origami's principles extend to various technological applications, from space exploration to everyday safety.

### Deployable Structures for Space
The Miura-ori pattern, a "granddaddy of deployable structures," has been used for solar arrays, notably flying on a space mission in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This pattern allows for single-motion opening and closing, becoming very thin and compact when flattened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Another pattern, the "origami flasher," has been proposed for satellite solar arrays to increase compactness for launch and enhance deployment reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. These demonstrate origami's role in [[origamis_role_in_space_and_aerodynamic_solutions | space solutions]].

### Aerodynamics for Freight Locomotives
New research in origami aims to improve the aerodynamics of freight locomotives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. By designing a deployable nose cone based on an origami pattern, which folds flat when not needed, engineers can significantly improve aerodynamics. Computer models and wind tunnel testing indicate that this could save companies millions of dollars annually in diesel fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Bulletproof Collapsible Walls
A foldable, bulletproof, collapsible wall based on the Yoshimura crease pattern has been developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Made from materials like Kevlar, it can be stored compactly in a police officer's car and deployed for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Tests show that 12 layers of Kevlar can stop handgun bullets, and a new design with interchangeable panels aims to stop rifle rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Compliant Mechanisms
Origami inspires the design of [[examples_of_compliant_mechanisms_in_everyday_objects | compliant mechanisms]], which use the flexibility of a material to achieve motion, rather than traditional hinges or bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This approach led to the creation of a continuously revolving compliant mechanism called a "Kalita cycle," challenging previous assumptions about compliant mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Mathematical Principles in Origami

The effective translation of origami into [[engineering_applications_of_origami | engineering applications]] heavily relies on [[mathematical_principles_in_origami | mathematical methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Crease Patterns and Circle Packing
A core mathematical concept is representing an origami design as a "crease pattern," which is a plan for folding a shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. For objects that can be represented as "stick figures" (e.g., a scorpion with legs and a tail), the "circle packing method" is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. This involves representing each feature of the object by a circular region and arranging these circles on a square sheet of paper, similar to packing balls into a box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The arrangement of these circles forms the skeleton of the crease pattern, from which all necessary fold lines can be geometrically constructed by following specific rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This systematic process ensures the resulting fold pattern yields the desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Origamizer Algorithm
For objects that are more like surfaces (e.g., a sphere or a blob-like animal), the stick figure algorithm is not suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. About a decade ago, Japanese mathematician Tomohiro Tachi developed "Origamizer," an algorithm that takes a triangulated surface as a mathematical description and generates the corresponding folding pattern to create that surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This algorithm allows any sheet of material to take on virtually any three-dimensional shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

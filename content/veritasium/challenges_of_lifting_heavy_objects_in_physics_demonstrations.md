Demonstrations involving heavy objects can highlight counter-intuitive physics principles, such as [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | gyroscopic precession]]. A key challenge in these demonstrations is managing the perceived and actual weight of the objects involved.

## The Demonstration Apparatus

An apparatus constructed at the University of Sydney's mechanical engineering shop consists of a 40-pound (19 kilogram) flywheel attached to the end of a meter-long shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Initial Challenges with a Non-Spinning Flywheel

Without the flywheel spinning, it is virtually impossible for one person to hold the shaft horizontally with a single hand at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Attempting to lift the entire apparatus over one's head with a single hand when the flywheel is not spinning is also extremely difficult and awkward, requiring significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Effect of Spinning: Gyroscopic Precession

When the flywheel is spun up to several thousand RPM, the dynamics change dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Holding the shaft horizontally with one hand becomes possible; the shaft remains horizontal, and the wheel appears "weightless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This phenomenon is known as [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | gyroscopic precession]]. Instead of pulling the wheel straight down, its weight creates a torque that causes it to move around in a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Lifting a Spinning Flywheel

The true test of the counter-intuitive nature of [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | gyroscopic precession]] involves lifting the spinning flywheel over the head with one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Despite the apparatus being a 40-pound (19 kilogram) object, when the flywheel is spinning at maximum speed, lifting it feels "incredibly light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The person performing the lift experiences a sensation that the object is "wanting to go up by itself" and that they are "not struggling" or applying the expected amount of force for such a weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Verifying Apparent Weightlessness with [[measurement_of_large_forces | a Scale]]

To demonstrate that the object is not *actually* weightless, even if it feels that way, a scale can be used.

*   The weight of the person performing the demonstration is approximately 72 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   When the person picks up the non-spinning flywheel, the scale reads about 91 kilograms, accounting for the flywheel's 19-kilogram weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

The audience is then challenged to predict whether the scale reading will be more than, less than, or equal to 91 kilograms when the spinning flywheel is lifted over the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This highlights the distinction between the *perceived* effort and the *actual* force being exerted due to the principles of rotational dynamics.

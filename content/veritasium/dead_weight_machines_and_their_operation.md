Dead weight machines are specialized devices used to measure and calibrate exceptionally large forces with high accuracy. These machines employ precisely known masses, leveraging their weight under gravity to create a standard force for calibrating force sensors.

## Purpose and Scale
While an apple weighs approximately 1 newton and the world record for jet engine thrust is 570,000 newtons, the Saturn V rocket that launched people to the moon had a thrust of 33,360,000 newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Accurately [[measurement_of_large_forces | measuring forces]] of this magnitude requires highly specialized equipment.

## The World's Largest Dead Weight Machine
Rick Seifarth, a physical scientist in the Mass and Force Group, manages a dead weight machine with an astonishing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This machine can apply 4,448,222 newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This specific number is precisely equivalent to 1,000,000 pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It consists of twenty 50,000-pound increments, cumulatively reaching 4.45 meganewtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This facility is believed to be the location where the largest mass objects in the world are calibrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> and is considered the biggest machine of its type globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Another machine at the facility has a capacity of 13.3 meganewtons, or three million pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## How it Works
The dead weight machine operates by using precisely calibrated masses located below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Their weight is utilized to calibrate force sensors, also known as force transducers, in the lab upstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The calibration process involves:
1.  Placing a force transducer on a compression head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  A hydraulic ram in the attic begins to raise a green lifting frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
3.  Once the force transducer contacts a red loading frame, it starts lifting the weights located downstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
4.  As the lifting frame continues to rise, more of the 50,000-pound weights become suspended by the force sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
5.  Since the weights create an accurately known force, the readouts from the force transducer can be precisely calibrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Applications
Calibrated force transducers are then used in the field, often embedded in test stands. For example, they are critical for monitoring forces during rocket engine firings, ensuring that thrust levels are accurate and within specified parameters, such as 104% of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This precision is vital for the safety and performance of complex engineering systems like airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. As Rick Seifarth states, "one physical test is worth a thousand expert opinions," emphasizing the importance of direct, accurate measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Precision and Uncertainty
The precision required for these measurements is extreme. Each 50,000-pound mass piece, roughly equivalent to ten minivans, has its exact value known to within several American nickels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Calibration Process
This minuscule uncertainty is achieved by a rigorous calibration process:
1.  The calibration starts by comparing combinations of known weights, beginning with K20, the United States fundamental mass standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This process is part of the broader efforts on [[alternative_approaches_to_defining_the_kilogram | defining the kilogram]] accurately.
2.  Weights are gradually scaled up; for instance, a 5-kilogram mass is compared to two 2-kilogram and one 1-kilogram mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
3.  The process converts to pounds, moving from 50-pound masses to 500 pounds, then 2,500 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
4.  Using a scale in the floor, weights are scaled up to 10,000 pounds, 20,000 pounds, and finally 30,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
5.  Combinations of these large weights are then used to calibrate the 50,000-pound masses that form the dead weight machine's stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Accuracy
The vertical force vector generated by these weights is sold with an uncertainty of 0.0005%, or five parts per million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This means that at a full 1,000,000 pounds of applied force, the accuracy is guaranteed to be within five pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Achieving this level of precision requires accounting for several factors:
*   **Gravitational Acceleration:** The gravitational acceleration at the machine's location is slightly less than Earth's standard gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. An additional 600 pounds are added to compensate for this difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Buoyant Force:** The masses displace 125 pounds of air, creating a buoyant force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. A further 125 pounds must be added to counteract this and reach the precise million pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

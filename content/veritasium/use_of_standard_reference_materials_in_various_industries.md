Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) are precisely characterized samples of substances used across a multitude of industries to ensure accuracy, consistency, and safety in measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. These materials are often meticulously analyzed by institutions like the [[Role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST | National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]], which produces and sells nearly 1300 different SRMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The high cost of SRMs, sometimes thousands of dollars for a single jar, is primarily due to the extensive scientific effort required to precisely determine their composition and properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The overarching goal of an SRM is to quantify something about the world that is often difficult to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Food Industry

SRMs are vital in the food industry for ensuring product accuracy and safety.
*   **Nutritional Labeling**
    *   One example is peanut butter, where a single jar can cost around a thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. [[Role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST | NIST]] scientists spend years meticulously measuring the fats and other compounds in these homogenous jars, providing a certificate of exact composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Food manufacturers use this standard peanut butter to calibrate their equipment, ensuring that the nutritional values printed on their product labels are accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
    *   Other food SRMs include "Meat Homogenate," a mixed meat product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, and a "standard trout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. These are developed in consultation with industry to provide matrices that closely match the foods being measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   [[Role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST | NIST]] offers about 30 different food items, categorized by their position on a "food triangle" based on carbohydrate, fat, and protein content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   A "typical diet" SRM, made by blending and freeze-drying a composite of average American consumption, helps characterize nutritional components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Contaminant Detection**
    *   Beyond nutrients, SRMs are critical for detecting harmful substances. For instance, the standard peanut butter contains a known level of naturally occurring aflatoxins, a carcinogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Factories use this to calibrate their equipment to accurately detect elevated levels of aflatoxins in their products, preventing potentially dangerous batches from reaching consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Manufacturing and Materials Science

SRMs have a foundational role in ensuring the quality and safety of manufactured materials.
*   **Steel Quality**
    *   In the early 1900s, there were significant issues with the quality of steel used in rail cars, as foundries lacked a common standard for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Congress mandated the National Bureau of Standards (now [[Role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST | NIST]]) to create standard steel samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. These standards, analyzed for all constituent elements like chrome, iron, and carbon, allowed foundries to compare their results to a known source, ensuring consistent quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
    *   [[Role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST | NIST]]'s best-selling product is the Charpy bar, a standard piece of steel with a V-notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. These bars are used annually by companies worldwide to test the impact strength of their steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The test involves breaking the Charpy bar with a pendulum, and the energy required to break it is calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This is critical for steels used in pipelines, defense industries, and nuclear waste storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. [[Role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST | NIST]] sells about 8,000 Charpy bars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Historical Materials**
    *   [[Role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST | NIST]] still produces its very first SRM, limestone number one, 110 years after its inception, selling 40 to 50 units a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Safety and Flammability Testing

SRMs are used to standardize safety tests, particularly those involving fire.
*   **Cigarette Flammability**
    *   Standardized cigarettes were developed to help manufacturers determine the flammability of materials like mattresses, sheets, and bed clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. These SRMs, used in conjunction with ASTM tests, ensure consistent results when assessing how easily materials might ignite from a combustible source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

[[how_bicycles_work | Most people do not know how bicycles work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When riding a bicycle, turning the handlebars in the direction you want to go, as you would with a car, does not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This is because steering a bicycle affects both its direction and your balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## The Counterintuitive Nature of Turning
To turn a bicycle left, you must first steer the handlebars slightly to the right, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This action is known as countersteering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Why Countersteering is Necessary
If you attempt to turn right by steering the handlebars to the right, you effectively steer the bike out from under you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This causes you to lean to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. To prevent falling, the only course of action is to steer the bike to the left, resulting in a left turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Therefore, to genuinely turn right, you must first countersteer to the left to initiate a lean to the right, allowing you to turn into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Intuitive Action
Riders perform countersteering intuitively without explicit knowledge or conscious thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. When asked to turn in a specific direction, cyclists will naturally countersteer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Analogy to an Inverted Pendulum
Riding a bicycle is analogous to balancing an inverted pendulum, such as a broomstick on your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. To move the pendulum in a desired direction, you first move its base in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This initiates a lean in the intended direction, allowing you to move with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Similarly, on a unicycle, to move forward, you first pedal backward to lean forward before moving with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Steering for Balance
The primary purpose of steering in bicycling is not just to turn the bike, but to maintain balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. It is difficult to balance on a stationary bike because steering, which is essential for keeping the bike underneath you, does not work when motionless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Balance is achieved by steering the bike to keep it beneath the rider, rather than solely by body positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Even when riding straight, constant small steering adjustments are made to maintain balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This involves moving the front wheel's contact patch under the rider, similar to balancing a broomstick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

A bicycle with locked handlebars, preventing any steering, is as difficult to balance as a stationary bike, even when moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This demonstrates that the [[gyroscopic_effect_and_bike_stability | gyroscopic effect]] of spinning wheels does not directly keep the bike upright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, but rather the ability to steer the bike back under the rider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

[[bicycle_balance_and_steering_mechanisms | Bicycles are designed to steer themselves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. If they begin to fall to one side, the handlebars automatically turn in that direction, steering the wheels back underneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This [[selfsteering_mechanisms_in_bicycles | self-correcting steering]] is the primary reason bicycles remain stable without a rider, rather than the gyroscopic effect alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

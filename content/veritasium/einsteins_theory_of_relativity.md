The [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | General Theory of Relativity]] is our current best [[General theory of relativity and gravity | theory of gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Its first solution predicted black holes, white holes, the existence of parallel universes, and possibly a way to travel between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

### Origin and Fundamental Concept
The [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general theory of relativity]] emerged, in part, due to a fundamental flaw in Newtonian gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Isaac Newton, in the 1600s, observed phenomena like an apple falling and the Moon orbiting the Earth, concluding that every object with mass attracts every other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. However, Newton was troubled by how masses separated by vast distances could exert force on each other, considering "action at a distance" to be an absurdity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

Over 200 years later, Albert Einstein determined how gravity is mediated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Instead of bodies directly exerting forces on each other, a mass (like the Sun) [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | curves the spacetime]] in its immediate vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | curvature]] then extends outwards, causing objects like Earth to orbit the Sun because the [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | spacetime]] it travels through is [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | curved]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Masses are thus affected by the local [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | curvature]] of [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | spacetime]], eliminating the need for action at a distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### [[general relativity equations | Einstein's Field Equations]]
This concept is mathematically described by [[general relativity equations | Einstein's field equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. These equations, developed by Einstein over a decade after special relativity, link the distribution of matter and energy to the resultant [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | curvature]] of [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:23]</a>. Though they appear as a single line, they represent a family of coupled differential equations, requiring many steps to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Solutions to [[general relativity equations | Einstein's equations]] describe how [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | spacetime]] [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | curves]] and how to measure the separation between two events in that [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | curved geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

### Solutions to [[general relativity equations | Einstein's Equations]]
Einstein published his equations in 1915 but could not find an exact solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

#### Schwarzschild Solution
Karl Schwarzschild, an astrophysicist stationed on the Eastern Front during WWI, found the first non-trivial solution to [[general relativity equations | Einstein's equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. He imagined the simplest scenario: an eternal, static universe containing only a single, spherically symmetric, electrically neutral, non-rotating point mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. This solution, known as the Schwarzschild metric, describes how [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | spacetime curves]] outside the mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. It shows that far from the mass, [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | spacetime]] is nearly flat, but closer to it, [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | spacetime]] becomes increasingly [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | curved]], attracting objects and causing time to run slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

Initially simple, this solution presented two problem spots:
*   **Singularity at the center (r=0)**: Here, terms in the equation are divided by zero, causing them to "blow up" to infinity, meaning the equation can no longer describe physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   **Singularity at the Schwarzschild radius (r=2M)**: At this specific distance, a second singularity appears where terms also "blow up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. At the Schwarzschild radius, the [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | spacetime curvature]] becomes so steep that the escape velocity reaches the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. This implies that inside this radius, nothing, not even light, can escape, leading to the concept of a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

Many scientists initially doubted the existence of black holes, believing some physical process would prevent stars from collapsing into a single point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. However, later work by Jay Robert Oppenheimer and George Volkoff showed that even neutron stars have a maximum mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder then demonstrated that for the heaviest stars, there's nothing to prevent indefinite contraction once their fuel runs out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

Einstein struggled with the idea of black holes because his mathematical analysis showed time freezing on the event horizon, implying nothing could ever enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. Oppenheimer offered a resolution: while an outside observer would never see anything enter (as the last photons they receive are from just outside the horizon and become infinitely redshifted and dimmed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>, an observer falling across the event horizon would not notice anything unusual and would pass through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

The "singularity" at the event horizon in the Schwarzschild solution is not a real physical singularity but a result of a poor choice of coordinate system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>. By choosing a different coordinate system through a coordinate substitution, this singularity disappears, allowing things to cross into the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.

Visualizations like Penrose diagrams, which map infinite [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | spacetime]] onto a finite diagram, reveal that for a Schwarzschild black hole, the singularity is not a place in space but a moment in timeâ€”the very last moment for anything that enters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>.

#### Schwarzschild Solution and its [[Experiments and predictions related to general relativity | Predictions]]
Pushing the Schwarzschild solution to its mathematical limits, where every edge ends at a singularity or infinity, leads to several theoretical [[Experiments and predictions related to general relativity | predictions]]:

*   **White Holes**: The time-reversed picture of a black hole, where things are expelled outwards instead of falling in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. If you are inside a white hole's event horizon, you *must* be ejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>. [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | Relativity]] does not specify the direction of time flow, so any solution has a time-reversed counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>.
*   **Parallel Universes**: The Schwarzschild solution, when maximally extended, implies the existence of a whole new universe parallel to our own, which could be entered by being "ejected" from a white hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. An astronaut falling into a black hole in one universe could find themselves in the same black hole as someone from another universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>.
*   **Wormholes (Einstein-Rosen Bridges)**: The solution includes a point where universes cross, known as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>. This creates a theoretical wormhole connecting the space of both universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>. However, these wormholes are not stable in time; they pinch off too quickly for anything to traverse them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>.

#### Kerr Solution (Rotating Black Holes)
While Schwarzschild's solution was found quickly, solving [[general relativity equations | Einstein's equations]] for a spinning mass proved much harder, taking 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>. In 1963, Roy Kerr found the solution for a spinning black hole, which is far more complicated than Schwarzschild's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>. This solution introduces several dramatic changes:
*   **Layered Structure**: The black hole consists of multiple layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>.
*   **No Spherical Symmetry**: Rotation causes it to bulge at the equator, making it only symmetric about its spin axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.
*   **Ergosphere**: Space near a rotating black hole gets dragged around with it, creating a region called the ergosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>. Within the ergosphere, it's impossible to stay still relative to distant stars, but escape from the black hole is still possible as space doesn't flow directly inward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:00">[30:26:00]</a>.
*   **Inner Event Horizon**: Beyond the outer horizon (point of no return), one can enter a region where free movement is possible again, avoiding the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>.
*   **Ring Singularity**: In a rotating black hole, the singularity expands from a point into a ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. It's theoretically possible to fly through this ring singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>.
*   **Anti-verse**: Flying through the center of the ring singularity leads to an "anti-verse," a strange universe where gravity pushes instead of pulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>. One could theoretically jump back across the singularity to a universe with normal gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:48:00">[32:48:00]</a>.
*   **Infinite Universes**: The maximally extended Kerr solution suggests an infinite number of universes connected by black holes and white holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14:00">[33:14:00]</a>.

### Physical Reality and Limitations of these [[Experiments and predictions related to general relativity | Predictions]]
While these solutions of [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | relativity]] yield fascinating [[Experiments and predictions related to general relativity | predictions]], their physical existence is debated:
*   **Eternal Solutions**: Both the extended Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions describe eternal black holes in an empty universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>. They do not include a formation mechanism, which is why black holes are believed to exist in our universe, but white holes are generally thought not to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>.
*   **Inner Horizon Instability**: For the maximally extended Kerr solution, an immortal astronaut could pile up infinite light along the inner horizon, creating an infinite flux of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:26:00">[34:26:00]</a>. This energy concentration would create its own singularity, sealing off the ring singularity and any beyond-universe connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>. This suggests that all white holes, wormholes, and parallel/anti-universes predicted by the Kerr solution might disappear in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[35:03:00]</a>.
*   **Traversable Wormholes**: Michael Morris and Kip Thorne, in 1987, explored wormholes for interstellar travel that are horizon-less, stable, and constructible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>. While [[general relativity equations | Einstein's general relativity]] allows for such geometries in theory, they require an exotic kind of matter with negative energy density to prevent collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:24:00">[35:24:00]</a>. Such matter is considered to be against the laws of physics, making these "science fiction" wormholes unlikely to be possible if one adheres to the actual properties of matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:00">[35:48:00]</a>.

Based on our current best understanding, white holes, traversable wormholes, and these parallel universes are unlikely to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>. However, since black holes were once thought impossible, future discoveries might bring new surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>.

Mosquitoes exhibit a preference for certain individuals over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This attraction is at least partially [[genetic_factors_influencing_mosquito_attraction | genetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Mosquito Biology and Lifecycle

Only female mosquitoes bite, as they require blood proteins to produce their eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The [[mosquito_breeding_and_lifecycle | mosquito lifecycle]] begins with eggs hatching into wriggly larvae, which then develop into pupae before transforming into flying, adult mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These adults subsequently seek out vertebrate blood for further egg production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The entire [[mosquito_breeding_and_lifecycle | lifecycle]] spans approximately two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Professor Immo Hansen, a "mosquito man" at New Mexico State University, maintains colonies of various mosquito species, including an exotic strain he feeds with his own blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. He reported receiving about 25 bites at a time when feeding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Some mosquito species, like the one used in the Y-tube test, are highly specialized and feed almost exclusively on humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Mosquito Attraction

### Genetic Influences

Research indicates that [[genetic_factors_influencing_mosquito_attraction | genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This was demonstrated through a Y-tube test study involving 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non-identical (fraternal) female twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The study found a higher correlation in mosquito attractiveness among identical twins compared to fraternal twins, suggesting a significant genetic component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The researchers estimate that [[genetic_factors_influencing_mosquito_attraction | attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

A 2017 study, involving 16,000 participants who opted into research with 23andMe, identified seven specific locations on human DNA (single letter changes) associated with varying levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Chemical Signals and Body Odor

It is believed that [[chemical_signals_affecting_mosquito_behavior | genetic changes influencing mosquito attraction]] are related to the odor or [[chemical_signals_affecting_mosquito_behavior | volatile chemicals]] our bodies emit, as well as the skin microbiome (bacteria on our skin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Mosquitoes primarily track carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Therefore, individuals with higher metabolism, those who have recently exercised, larger people, or pregnant individuals are more likely to attract mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Other [[chemical_signals_affecting_mosquito_behavior | volatile chemicals]] that attract mosquitoes include lactic acid, acetone, and ammonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Conversely, some naturally occurring [[chemical_signals_affecting_mosquito_behavior | chemicals]] that humans give off, such as octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, appear to repel mosquitoes or hinder their ability to locate humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Mosquitoes' Impact on Human Health

Mosquitoes are considered the most dangerous animal in the world due to their profound impact on human health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Malaria alone has historically killed more people than humans have killed each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. While some estimates that mosquitoes have killed over half of all humans who have ever lived are debated and likely too high, over a million people die annually from mosquito-borne illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This makes mosquitoes responsible for more human deaths than any other single cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

One striking example of [[role_of_evolution_in_human_attractiveness_to_mosquitoes | evolution]] is how the malaria parasite manipulates its host's body chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. If a human contracts malaria, their body begins to produce an odor that makes them *more* attractive to mosquitoes, thus facilitating the parasite's transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Research Methods: The Y-Tube Test

The Y-tube test is a method used to assess mosquito attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Mosquitoes are placed in a holding chamber, and a fan induces a draft towards two arms of a Y-shaped tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. A "bait," such as a human hand (often rubbed to enhance the release of oils and sweat), is inserted into one arm, while the other serves as a control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Researchers then observe which arm the mosquitoes choose, quantifying attraction by the fraction of mosquitoes that fly towards the bait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This test was instrumental in discovering the genetic basis for mosquito attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## 23andMe's Role in Research

23andMe, a company that interprets sections of human genetic code, has been involved in identifying specific DNA locations linked to mosquito attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Through genome-wide association studies, where participants opt-in to research and report their perceived mosquito attractiveness, scientists can identify genetic commonalities among those who report high or low attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. While the mosquito attractiveness test is not currently available to customers, 23andMe offers information on physical traits, health aspects, and ancestral origins based on an individual's DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

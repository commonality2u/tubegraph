The [[Development of the atomic bomb | development of the atomic bomb]] during World War II profoundly changed the course of history, shaping global politics and leading to a [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | nuclear arms race]] that defined the Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The creation of these weapons allowed humanity to destroy itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Pre-War Scientific Discoveries

Prior to World War II, the idea of obtaining significant energy from radioactive atoms was largely dismissed by leading scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. [[History of Physics and Mathematics | Ernest Rutherford]], [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer's]] former mentor, stated in 1933 that anyone expecting power from atom transformations was "talking moonshine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Albert Einstein similarly believed in 1933 that there was "not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

However, key discoveries quickly shifted this perception:
*   **Proton Acceleration** John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton successfully accelerated protons to smash into lithium nuclei in 1932, earning them a Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This method, however, was highly inefficient due to protons being repelled by positively charged nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Neutron Discovery** The discovery of the neutron in 1932 provided a particle with no electric charge, meaning it would not be repelled by a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Chain Reaction Theory** In 1933, Leo Szilard conceived the idea of a nuclear chain reaction: an element split by neutrons that would emit more neutrons, capable of sustaining a reaction if assembled in a sufficiently large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Uranium Fission** On January 29, 1939, German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann successfully split a uranium atom by bombarding it with neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Initially skeptical, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] quickly realized the implications when Louise Alvarez replicated the experiment, speculating that extra neutrons could be used to generate power or make bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The Push for the Atomic Bomb

The impending threat of World War II catalyzed efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
*   **Einstein-Szilard Letter** In August 1939, Einstein, at Szilard's urging, wrote to President Franklin Roosevelt, warning him of the possibility of nuclear weapons and noting Germany's access to uranium from recently occupied Czechoslovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Formal Committee** Roosevelt established an informal uranium committee, which was upgraded to the S-1 committee in 1941, with the explicit goal of developing an atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **[[Manhattan Project and Los Alamos Laboratory | Manhattan Project]]** In May 1942, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] was hired as the coordinator of rapid rupture for the S-1 committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. On September 18, 1942, General Leslie Groves was put in charge of the [[Manhattan Project and Los Alamos Laboratory | Manhattan Project]], an undertaking for the [[Development of the atomic bomb | development of the atomic bomb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Groves chose [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] to be the science director of the soon-to-be-established [[Manhattan Project and Los Alamos Laboratory | Los Alamos laboratory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, despite [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer's]] lack of Nobel Prize, administrative experience, and links to the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Groves was impressed by his ambition and broad understanding of scientific fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Los Alamos** [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] proposed Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the isolated and sparsely populated site for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The project grew from an estimated six scientists to 764 scientists at Los Alamos and over 600,000 people involved in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Bomb Design and Concerns

*   **First Nuclear Reactor** On December 2, 1942, Enrico Fermi's team at the University of Chicago created Pile-1, the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, generating about half a watt of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This demonstrated that if a nuclear power plant could be made, a bomb could too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Critical Mass** The key to a nuclear bomb was achieving critical mass – enough fissile material (like uranium-235 or plutonium-239) assembled to create a runaway chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   **Gun-Type Design** Early efforts focused on a gun-type bomb using uranium-235, where two sub-critical masses are rapidly brought together by conventional explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   **Implosion Design** A new element, plutonium-239, synthesized in early 1941, was a more efficient fuel but reacted too quickly for a gun-type device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This led to the implosion bomb design, where conventional explosives compress a ball of plutonium, increasing its density and lowering its critical mass to initiate a chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. The "urchin," a tiny pellet of beryllium and polonium, served as a neutron source to kickstart the chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   **Atmospheric Ignition Concern** A terrifying concern for [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] and Arthur Compton was that a nuclear test could trigger a fusion reaction in the atmosphere, specifically involving hydrogen gas or nitrogen, leading to the destruction of all life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. While most scientists quickly realized this was unlikely, the idea of igniting a fusion reaction with a fission weapon remained significant after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

## End of World War II and the Atomic Bombings

*   **Trinity Test** Codenamed "Trinity," the first nuclear bomb, an implosion-type device called "the gadget," was detonated on July 16, 1945, at 5:29:21 AM, just one day before the Potsdam Conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. The explosion, equivalent to nearly 25,000 tons of TNT, illuminated the New Mexico mountains, created a 12-kilometer mushroom cloud, and melted desert sand into trinitite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   **Hiroshima and Nagasaki**
    *   On August 6, 1945, the "Little Boy," a gun-type nuclear bomb using 64 kilograms of enriched uranium, was dropped on Hiroshima, killing nearly 70,000 people immediately and another 70,000 from burns and radiation poisoning in subsequent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
    *   Three days later, an implosion-type bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, killing an estimated 80,000 more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. Over 95% of the 225,000 casualties in both bombings were civilians, primarily women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

After the Trinity test, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] famously recalled a verse from the Bhagavad Gita: "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.

## The Nuclear Arms Race

Following World War II, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] became a national hero and an advisor on [[Ethical implications and aftermath of nuclear weapons | nuclear weapons]] issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. He used his position to advocate for arms control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

*   **Soviet Atomic Bomb** In August 1949, the Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Hydrogen Bomb Development** The US military responded by pushing for the [[Development of the atomic bomb | development]] of a more powerful hydrogen bomb, known as "The Super" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] opposed this on ethical grounds and out of concern it would start an arms race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   **Ivy Mike Test** Despite [[life_and_imact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer's]] opposition, the first hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, was tested in the Marshall Islands three years later, with a yield of 10.4 megatons of TNT—400 times more powerful than the Trinity test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. A hydrogen bomb uses a conventional explosive to trigger a fission reaction, which then creates enough temperature and pressure to fuse deuterium and tritium, releasing immense energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   **Tsar Bomba** In 1961, the Soviet Union tested the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful explosion ever detonated, five times more powerful than Ivy Mike and around 2000 times more powerful than Trinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This escalation was exactly the [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | arms race]] [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] had feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

## [[Ethical implications and aftermath of nuclear weapons | Post-War Repercussions and Oppenheimer's Legacy]]

[[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer's]] opposition to the hydrogen bomb and calls for arms control led to the suspension of his security clearance in December 1953, based on his past links to the Communist Party and an affair with a party member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. He was accused of treason and espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.

[[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] viewed the situation of the atomic bomb as complex, stating that while the weapon would play a part in ending the war, the alternative of invasion would have been "much more terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. He believed that talks to halt the proliferation of [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | nuclear weapons]] "should have been done the day after Trinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

[[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, from throat cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

The [[history_of_pi_calculation_methods | history of Pi calculation methods]] reveals that for 2,000 years, the most successful method was painstakingly slow and tedious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This approach was significantly improved by Archimedes around 250 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## The Basic Principle
Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. The simplest way to estimate Pi involves drawing polygons inside and around a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

Initially, it was known that Pi must be between three and four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This can be demonstrated by:
*   **Inscribing a hexagon:** A regular hexagon with sides of length one can be drawn inside a circle, where the circle's diameter is two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The perimeter of this hexagon is six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Since the circle's circumference must be larger than the hexagon's perimeter, Pi (circumference/diameter) must be greater than 6/2, meaning Pi > 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Circumscribing a square:** Drawing a square around the circle gives a perimeter of eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. As this is larger than the circle's circumference, Pi must be less than 8/2, meaning Pi < 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Archimedes' Refinement
Archimedes refined this method by starting with a hexagon, similar to the basic demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. His key improvement involved:
1.  **Bisecting the polygon:** He bisected the hexagon to form a dodecagon (a regular 12-sided shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
2.  **Calculating perimeters:** He calculated the perimeter of both an inscribed and a circumscribed 12-gon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. The ratio of the inscribed polygon's perimeter to the diameter provided a lower bound for Pi, while the circumscribed polygon gave an upper bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
3.  **Iterative process:** Archimedes continued this process, calculating the perimeters for 12-gons, 24-gons, 48-gons, and finally 96-gons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
4.  **Complex calculations:** These calculations were complex, requiring the extraction of square roots and even square roots of square roots, all converted into fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Achieved Precision
Through his method, Archimedes was able to determine Pi to be between 3.1408 and 3.1429 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This was considered a significant achievement for over 2,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. The pursuit of Pi to higher precision using this method was seen as a demonstration of mathematical power and skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## Legacy
For the next 2,000 years following Archimedes, mathematicians continued to use and refine this method of bisecting polygons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. [[contributions_of_renaissance_mathematicians | Chinese]], Indian, Persian, and Arab mathematicians all contributed to improving these bounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Notable examples include:
*   **Francois Viete** (late 16th century): Doubled Archimedes' calculations a dozen more times, computing the perimeter of a polygon with 393,216 sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Ludolph van Ceulen** (turn of 17th century): Spent 25 years on the effort, computing the perimeter of a polygon with 2^62 (over four quintillion) sides, achieving 35 correct decimal places of Pi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. His digits were inscribed on his tombstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Christoph Grienberger**: Surpassed Van Ceulen's record 20 years later, achieving 38 correct decimal places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

This method was largely abandoned after [[isaac_newtons_approach_to_estimating_pi | Isaac Newton's approach to estimating Pi]] emerged in 1666, which offered a vastly more efficient way to calculate Pi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

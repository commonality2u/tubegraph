The phenomenon observed with grapes and microwaves, where two spheres of the right size and refractive index can focus electromagnetic energy, holds potential applications in the fabrication of microchips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Current Limitations and Proposed Solutions

Currently, the primary limitation in fabricating increasingly smaller microchips is lithography, which involves creating very small features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The grape phenomenon demonstrates that electromagnetic energy can be focused down to a tiny spotâ€”in this case, around a millimeter, from radiation with a 12-centimeter wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

If similar focusing capabilities could be achieved with light, it would offer a substantial improvement over existing lithography techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Harnessing this principle could enable the use of light to create extremely small features, potentially marking spots with about 2-nanometer resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This advancement would aid in the continuation of Moore's Law, allowing for the placement of many more small components on a single chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

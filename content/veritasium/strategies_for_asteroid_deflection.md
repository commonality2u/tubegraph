When faced with the potential threat of an asteroid impact, various strategies have been considered, though current capabilities are severely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. A committee that investigated these options 10 years prior to the video's creation concluded that there isn't a current way to deflect a kilometer-sized asteroid, let alone larger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

## Proposed Deflection Methods

### Bombing an Asteroid
One option considered is to try to bomb an asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. However, it's unclear how effective this would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Typically, if a body is blown up, the fragments expand out but not quickly enough to prevent gravity from pulling them back together, leading to the reformation of a rubble pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Blowing up an existing rubble pile asteroid is an unknown challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Attaching a Rocket for Nudging
Another idea involves a more gentle approach: attaching a rocket to the asteroid to gently nudge it aside, deflecting its path away from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. The primary challenge is that current rockets are not powerful enough to push an asteroid sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Furthermore, maintaining rockets attached to a rotating asteroid for centuries, which would be necessary to have a significant effect on its motion, is beyond current capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

### Ablating the Surface with Lasers
This method involves boiling the asteroid's surface using a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. However, lasers powerful enough for this task do not exist and would be challenging to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Even if such lasers existed, taking them to the object in space presents additional difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### Wrapping in Aluminum Foil
A more unconventional idea suggests wrapping an asteroid in aluminum cooking foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This method, while potentially viable in theory by changing the asteroid's radiative properties to alter its path, is not practical due to the inability to launch enough foil to cover an asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Evacuation as a Mitigation Strategy
Given the current inability to deflect large asteroids, the most hopeful, yet still incredibly difficult, strategy would be to evacuate a city if the impact location could be predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

However, historical cases of city evacuations, even with a week's warning for events like hurricanes, demonstrate significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Evacuating millions of people is problematic due to limited freeways; a single car breaking down could instantly block a freeway, trapping people within the target zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## Current Focus: Detection
Since effective deflection methods are not currently available, the most reasonable course of action is to focus on detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This involves:
*   Conducting asteroid surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   Building more telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   Deploying space-based telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

Improving [[detection_challenges_of_asteroids | asteroid detection]] capabilities is a major contribution to understanding the [[potential_threats_from_near_earth_objects | threat from asteroids]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Once a particularly dangerous object is identified, efforts can then be focused on developing and implementing deflection methods with real motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. The [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_impact | Chelyabinsk asteroid impact]] highlighted the existing gaps in detection, as an unrelated asteroid was completely missed despite a different asteroid's predicted close fly-by on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

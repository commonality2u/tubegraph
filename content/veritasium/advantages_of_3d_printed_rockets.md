[[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing technology]] is transforming rocket manufacturing, offering significant advantages over traditional methods. Relativity Space, a startup, has built the world's largest 3D metal printer with the ambitious goal of printing an entire rocket, including fuel tanks and rocket engines, in just 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Streamlined Manufacturing and Reduced Part Count

One of the most significant benefits of [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] is the drastic reduction in the number of individual parts required for a rocket.
*   **Reduced Complexity**: A rocket's propulsion system, including propellant tanks and rocket engines, forms the bulk of its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Traditionally, manufacturing these components involves building tools to build the rocket itself, such as NASA's 170-foot tall Vertical Assembly Center for welding fuel tanks for the Space Launch System (SLS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. In contrast, a fully [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] rocket can have a hundred times fewer parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Integrated Components**: An essential part of any rocket engine is the injector, which converts liquid propellant into a fine mist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Traditionally, an injector for liquid oxygen and liquid methane propellants could comprise over a thousand individual pieces and take nine months to assemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. With [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]], the entire injector can be printed as a single piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Advanced Cooling Channels**: Rocket combustion chambers can reach extreme temperatures of up to 3,500 Kelvin, hot enough to melt most metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. To prevent melting, cryogenic propellants are passed over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. On Space Shuttle main engines, this involved assembling thousands of small pipes (1,080 individual pipes) that were then brazed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] allows these cooling channels to be integrated directly into a single rocket nozzle part, eliminating the need for thousands of external pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Speed and Cost Efficiency

The [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] approach significantly accelerates the production timeline and reduces costs.
*   **Rapid Production**: Relativity Space, founded five and a half years ago, plans to launch its first rocket within the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This contrasts sharply with traditional projects like NASA's SLS, which took 11 years of development to get one assembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The company can print about 10 inches of aluminum alloy wire per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction**: Printing an injector takes two weeks and costs 10 times less than traditional manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Overall, [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] rockets are projected to be 5 to 100 times cheaper than current options, lowering the cost of space access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

## Design Freedom and Optimization

[[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] enables the creation of complex and optimized designs that would be impractical or impossible with traditional techniques.
*   **Complex Geometries**: Engineers can build smooth, curvy, and bio-inspired designs as easily as ordinary structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The optimal structure for a rocket, like the Terran R's base, can resemble organic shapes for stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This allows for features that could not be manufactured otherwise, making the [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] rocket look entirely different from a traditionally built one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Integrated Stiffeners**: Internal stiffeners can be printed directly into the rocket tank structure to prevent buckling and crumpling, similar to how internal pressure keeps a Coke can rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Despite their size, rocket tanks are thinner relative to their diameter than a Coke can, necessitating such reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Aerodynamic Performance**: The visible layers and surface roughness of [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] parts do not cause aerodynamic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Rapid Iteration and Software-Driven Manufacturing

The approach enables quick design changes and iterations, moving aerospace manufacturing closer to a "Silicon Valley style" of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Fast Design Cycles**: Since there's no fixed tooling, part geometries are controlled via the CAD model, allowing printers to print directly from the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This means designs can be changed extremely fast; a whole engine can be built in about a month, allowing for rapid iterations and improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Automated Correction**: Software can "reverse warp" the part before printing, ensuring the final product is perfectly straight even if the robots print a wobbly shape due to cooling effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Enhanced Material Properties

Despite common misconceptions, [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] metals can be stronger than those built traditionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This is achieved by developing custom alloys in-house and leveraging the physics principle of rapid melting, cooling, and solidification to produce strong alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Automation for Aerospace

[[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] provides a form of automation crucial for [[applications_in_aerospace_and_space_technology | aerospace]] manufacturing, which has historically lagged in adopting automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Unlike automobiles with tens of thousands of parts, commercial aircraft have several million, making robotic assembly far more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. With [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]], parts are "assembled" in the 3D file, and the printer produces them as a single assembled unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

While [[challenges_and_solutions_in_3d_printing_rockets | challenges in 3D printing rockets]] exist, especially for mass production, the company Relativity Space is well-positioned as world experts in [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] rocket hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. The long-term vision is to shrink this [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] technology and factory of the future to be launched to Mars, establishing an industrial base there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

Phone system hacks have evolved from simple frequency manipulation to sophisticated network infiltration, demonstrating persistent vulnerabilities in telecommunication infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Early Phone Hacking: Phreaking and the "Blue Box"

In the 1970s, long-distance phone calls were exceptionally expensive, with a call from New York to London potentially costing $25 per minute when adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This high cost incentivized early forms of phone hacking, known as phreaking.

Notably, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, before founding Apple, created a device called the "blue box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This illegal product allowed them to hack the telephone network and trick the telephone company into connecting calls for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Wozniak believed that without the blue box, Apple Computer would never have existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. They famously used it to call the Pope, with Wozniak pretending to be Henry Kissinger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Evolution of Telephone Technology and Vulnerabilities

Early phone systems, until the mid-1920s, relied on operators who manually connected calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. When a receiver was lifted, a voltage drop alerted the operator, who would then connect the lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. By 1950, over a million operators were employed in the US alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

To reduce costs, companies automated call connections with the rotary dial telephone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This device sent pulses corresponding to each dialed number, acting as "control signals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. However, long transmission lines distorted these pulses, making automated long-distance calls almost impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

The solution was the "touch-tone" or push-button telephone, which used unique combinations of two tones (frequencies) for each button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. By sending control signals within the human voice's hearing range (300 to 3,400 Hertz), telephone networks could receive them independently of distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

This innovation, however, presented a new opportunity for exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. When making a long-distance call, it was routed to a central node that communicated with a remote node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. They checked for a free line by sending a 2600 Hertz tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Jobs and Wozniak exploited this by dialing a toll-free number to connect to a local node, then sending a 2600 Hertz tone to trick the remote node into thinking the call had disconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. By stopping their tone, the remote node assumed a new call was being placed, allowing them to dial any long-distance number for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Some people even used a toy whistle from a Cap'n Crunch cereal box, which happened to make the 2600 Hertz frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Modern Phone Hacking: Exploiting SS7 Vulnerabilities

To counter these vulnerabilities, telephone companies developed a new signaling protocol: [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | Signaling System no. 7 (SS7)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] uses a separate digital line for control signals, preventing control of the network via voice line tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Though introduced in 1980, it is still broadly in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

Initially, [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] was considered secure because the telecommunications landscape was dominated by a few large, reputable operators with established relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The system was designed as a "walled garden" â€“ a closed network with few barriers once inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

However, the landscape has drastically shifted, with over 1,200 operators and 4,500 networks now needing [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] access, including virtual network operators and mass-text services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Not all these new players are trustworthy, and some sell or can be bribed or hacked, opening thousands of ways into [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Access to a single [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] connection can cost a few thousand dollars per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### [[exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_phone_systems | Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Phone Systems]]: A Three-Step Process

Cybersecurity specialists Karsten Nohl and Alexandre De Oliveira outline three steps to [[exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_phone_systems | exploit SS7 vulnerabilities]]:

1.  **Infiltrate [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]]**: This is achieved by obtaining access to a Global Title (GT), which acts like an IP address for [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Because telcos establish roaming agreements, accessing one trusted GT can grant access to all partner GTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. An invoice showed a valuable US-based GT being leased illegally for $13,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
2.  **Gain Trust**: To uniquely identify a target and appear trusted, attackers need the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), a unique 15-digit identifier belonging to the SIM card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This is typically collected by sending messages like "send routing info" or "send routing info for SM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
3.  **Attack**: Once trust is gained, various attacks are possible:

    *   **Call Interception/Redirection**: By tricking the network into thinking the target's phone is roaming, the attacker can rewrite the number being called to one they control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. This was demonstrated when a call intended for Linus Tech Tips' Linus went to the demonstrator instead, with Linus's phone not ringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The attacker can then reroute the call to the actual target while simultaneously recording the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. For this specific attack, only the target's phone number is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

    *   **[[impact_of_mobile_phone_security_breaches | Intercepting Text Messages]] and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Similar to calls, tricking the network into thinking the target is roaming reroutes their text messages to the attacker's GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. This allows attackers to steal one-time passwords used in 2FA, providing access to accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This attack works for a few seconds until the subscriber interacts with their phone network and it reconnects to the correct GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. SMS 2FA is often the default, and sometimes the only, authentication option, even for sensitive accounts like bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

    *   **Location Tracking**: Using the IMSI number and switching center information, a command can be sent to the switching center where the device is connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. This request, routinely used for legitimate purposes like emergency services, simply identifies the cell tower the target is connected to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. In urban areas, this can pinpoint a location to within a hundred meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] does not rely on GPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. In 2016, Karsten Nohl's team used this method to track US Congressman Ted Lieu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

### Real-World [[impact_of_mobile_phone_security_breaches | Impact of Mobile Phone Security Breaches]]

The abduction of Princess Latifa of Dubai in 2018 highlighted the severe consequences of [[exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_phone_systems | SS7 attacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Her yacht captain was the victim of a coordinated [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7 attack]] aimed at pinpointing his location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Attackers leased multiple GTs in different countries and sent numerous IMSI and location requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. While many requests were blocked by firewalls, unblocked requests from a nearby US GT likely provided the necessary information, illustrating a "classic sophisticated pattern of attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

Criminals have used [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] to intercept SMS 2FA codes and steal millions of dollars from bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. The NSO Group, known for its Pegasus spyware, acquired an [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] tracking company in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. They use [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] to gather basic data like device type and software version before committing resources to costly "zero-click" exploits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Evidence suggests over 2.5 million tracking attempts per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>, primarily targeting individuals of interest to state agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

### Attempts to Mitigate and Future Outlook

In 2014, Karsten Nohl and Tobias Engel publicly exposed [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7 vulnerabilities]], particularly the "anytime interrogation" request, which allowed location tracking without knowing the IMSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. This public disclosure served as a "wake-up call" for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. Following their conference, all German telcos immediately began refusing these requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. However, while "anytime integration" was largely stopped, over 150 other messages still need to be addressed to make [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] fully secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

[[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] persists because it is the backbone of 2G and 3G communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Phasing out these older technologies presents challenges; for example, modern cars equipped with emergency call buttons often rely on 2G and 3G SIM cards to cut costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Even when 4G connectivity drops, older networks provide vital legacy support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

While the 5G signaling protocol is considered much more secure and can stop these attacks completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>, [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] remains the de facto standard for routing calls between networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. This is due to a "first mover disadvantage" â€“ no single company wants to be the first to adopt new technology when network effects mean the benefits only accrue once everyone else joins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>. Without major events pushing it into the public radar, [[ss7_protocol_and_its_ vulnerabilitie s| SS7]] networks may not be fully switched off for another 10 to 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

## Personal Protection and Privacy

While [[exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_phone_systems | phone system vulnerabilities]] exist, there are [[steps_individuals_can_take_to_protect_against_ss7_attacks | steps individuals can take to protect against SS7 attacks]]:
*   **Location Tracking**: There is not much individuals can do to prevent location tracking if they have a SIM card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication**: Choose alternatives to SMS-based 2FA, such as Authenticator apps or hardware tokens, to prevent message interception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   **Phone Tapping**: Use encrypted internet-based calling services like Signal or WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

Experts note that these attacks mainly target "people of interest" to state agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. However, the ongoing privacy intrusion from [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] abuses raises a philosophical question about whether privacy is a prerequisite for democracy, or if "nothing to hide, nothing to fear" applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. The technological world will always have vulnerabilities, with new ones arising as old systems are secured or replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

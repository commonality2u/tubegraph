On April 10th, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope was set to release the first-ever image of a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a>. This image, expected to resemble a "fuzzy coffee mug stain," is crucial for determining if the [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | general theory of relativity]] accurately predicts phenomena in the strong gravity regime around a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15"></a>.

## Anatomy of a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | Black Hole]]

### Event Horizon
The [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]]'s event horizon is the boundary beyond which not even light, fired radially away, can be detected by an outside observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53"></a>. Once inside, all world lines terminate at the singularity in the center, and there is no escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04"></a>. The radius of the event horizon is known as the Schwarzschild radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13"></a>. An isolated [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] cannot be imaged directly because it absorbs all electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18"></a>.

### Accretion Disk
The [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A*, is surrounded by an accretion disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28"></a>. This disk consists of dust and gas swirling chaotically at millions of degrees, moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39"></a>. The [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] "feeds" off this matter, growing larger over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50"></a>.

The accretion disk does not extend all the way to the event horizon because there is an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59"></a>. For a non-spinning [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], this orbit is located at three Schwarzschild radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10"></a>. Matter crossing this orbit rapidly spirals into the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]]'s center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35"></a>.

### Photon Sphere
Light, having no mass, can orbit closer to a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] than matter, specifically at 1.5 Schwarzschild radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45"></a>. This forms a sphere of photon orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02"></a>. Within this unstable orbit, photons will eventually either spiral into the singularity or escape to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20"></a>.

## The [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | Black Hole]] Shadow and [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | Relativistic Effects]]

The [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]]'s "shadow" in an image is not simply the event horizon, the photon sphere, or the ISCO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32"></a>. This is due to the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] warping space-time, causing light rays to follow curved paths rather than straight lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51"></a>.

When parallel light rays approach a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]]:
*   Rays crossing the event horizon are absorbed and become part of the dark region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16"></a>.
*   Rays coming in just above the event horizon or even at the distance of the photon sphere will also be bent and fall into the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23"></a>.
*   To avoid falling in, a parallel light ray must originate at least 2.6 Schwarzschild radii away; such a ray will just graze the photon sphere at its closest approach before heading off to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43"></a>.

The resulting shadow is therefore 2.6 times larger than the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09"></a>. The center of this shadow directly maps to the event horizon, but due to extreme light bending, light rays from the backside of the event horizon are also mapped onto a ring within this shadow, allowing observers to effectively "see" the entirety of the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23"></a>. Approaching the edge of the shadow, one can theoretically see an infinite number of images of the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04"></a>. The first visible light comes from rays that graze the photon sphere before reaching the telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21"></a>.

### Viewing Angles and [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole | Relativistic Beaming]]
Observing a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] at an angle to its accretion disk reveals even more complex [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | relativistic effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42"></a>. Due to the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]]'s warping of space-time, light from the back of the accretion disk can bend over the top and become visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57"></a>. Similarly, light from the bottom of the accretion disk can bend underneath the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] and appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21"></a>. This phenomenon can create an image similar to the "Interstellar black hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31"></a>.

Even more striking, light from the top of the accretion disk can go around the back of the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], graze the photon sphere, and appear as a thin ring underneath the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39"></a>. Conversely, light from the bottom front of the disk can go underneath and around the back, emerging over the top as another ring of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53"></a>.

Another critical [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | relativistic effect]] is [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole | relativistic beaming]] (also known as Doppler beaming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14"></a>. Since matter in the accretion disk moves very fast, close to the speed of light, the side moving towards the observer will appear significantly brighter than the side moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18"></a>. This results in a bright spot within the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29"></a>.

Observing changes in these images over time, such as blobs of matter moving around the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], would be particularly exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02"></a>.

[[purpose_and_function_of_shade_balls | Shade balls]] are plastic spheres designed to cover water surfaces, primarily reservoirs, to prevent sunlight exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. They are commonly used on drinking reservoirs, such as the LA reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Physical Characteristics
[[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | Shade balls]] are notable for being half-full of water, which makes them heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. For example, a bag containing 1,200 shade balls weighs 300 kilograms (660 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. When fully submerged, each individual ball supports approximately 300 grams due to its partial water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Coverage and Light Interaction
When packed as tightly as possible, these spheres cover approximately 91% of the water surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Despite their main [[purpose_and_function_of_shade_balls | purpose and function of shade balls]] being to block sunlight, a surprising amount of light still penetrates through the gaps and reflects off the balls, creating distinct patterns on the pool's bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Behavior in Water
[[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | Shade balls]] can arrange themselves into crystal structures when closely packed, forming boundaries between these "grains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Most of the LA reservoir is covered by multiple layers of these balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

In a single layer, shade balls can move past each other relatively easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. However, with multiple layers, the balls become trapped against each other, behaving more like a solid mass and offering significantly greater resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Interacting with Shade Balls
Swimming in a single layer of [[swimming_in_shade_balls | shade balls]] is possible, but challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Swimmers encounter frequent impacts from the balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, and the noise they generate when agitated is considerable, making it difficult to hear anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. [[physical_challenges_of_moving_through_shade_balls | Moving through shade balls]] increases drag, a force that opposes motion in a fluid, due to encountering more balls per second and their increased relative speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

In multiple layers, [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming in shade balls]] becomes extremely difficult, with limited forward movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. While it's possible to float on the surface if stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, any movement causes the balls to shift, leading to sinking deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Attempts to run or slide across the surface are generally unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Supporting a body entirely above the water requires a large number of balls underneath (e.g., over 260 shade balls for one individual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Despite the novelty, the manufacturer of shade balls does not recommend [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming in shade balls]] due to potential danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. They regularly decline requests from residential customers for this reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

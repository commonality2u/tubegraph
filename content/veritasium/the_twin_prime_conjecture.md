The Twin Prime Conjecture is a significant unsolved problem in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It concerns a specific type of prime number pair.

## Definition of Twin Primes

Twin primes are [[mathematical_uniqueness_of_prime_numbers | prime numbers]] that are separated by exactly one number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples include 11 and 13, or 17 and 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Properties and Rarity

As one progresses along the number line, prime numbers themselves occur less frequently, and twin primes are even rarer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Conjecture

The Twin Prime Conjecture proposes that there are infinitely many twin primes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This means that, theoretically, you would never exhaust the supply of twin primes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Current Status

As of the present, no one has successfully proven this conjecture to be either true or false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It remains an [[oldest_unsolved_problem_in_mathematics | unsolved question]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## Connection to Undecidability

The Twin Prime Conjecture exemplifies a type of statement that may be true but cannot be proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This phenomenon is related to the concept of undecidability in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

*   A [[Alan Turing | Turing machine]] program could be conceptualized to attempt to solve the Twin Prime Conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. Such a program would start with axioms and systematically construct all possible theorems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. If it generates the Twin Prime Conjecture, it would halt; otherwise, it would continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
*   However, if the [[Alan Turing | halting problem]] (the problem of determining if a program will ever halt) is undecidable, then solving the Twin Prime Conjecture this way is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.
*   Therefore, the Twin Prime Conjecture might be truly unsolvable, meaning mathematicians may never know if there are an infinite number of twin primes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. This implies that there is no algorithm that can always determine whether a statement is derivable from the axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are metals that can adjust their atomic arrangement to return to a predefined shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. They also convert between mechanical and thermal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, and can stretch up to 30 times more than ordinary metals while still springing back to their original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This makes them appear "about as close to magic as it is possible to find in nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Discovery of Nitinol

The first notable [[nitinol_metal_properties | shape memory alloy]], nitinol, was discovered in 1961 at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Researchers were experimenting with nickel and titanium alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. An associate technical director, who was a pipe smoker, applied heat from his lighter to a sample that had been repeatedly worked, heated, and cooled, and observed that the material changed shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This unexpected behavior led to further investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The name "nitinol" combines its components (nickel and titanium) with the name of the laboratory where it was discovered (Naval Ordnance Laboratory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Key Properties

### Shape Memory Effect

The ability of [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]] to change shape is due to a reversible solid-state phase change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Austenite Phase**: In heated [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]], atoms are arranged in a cubic lattice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This is the "parent" or "memory" shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Twinned Martensite Phase**: Upon cooling, the atoms ease into a "messier, lower symmetry" arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Detwinned Martensite Phase**: When stress is applied to the twinned martensite, the crystal structure changes again, allowing for deformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Unlike ordinary metals, this deformation does not cause bonds to break or edge dislocations to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Shape Recovery**: When heated back up, the material transitions from martensite to austenite, causing the atoms to return to their original locations and the material to revert to its predefined shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The temperature at which this transition occurs can be tuned between -150째C to -350째C by changing the element ratio and heat treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Superelasticity (Pseudoelasticity)

[[nitinol_metal_properties | Shape memory alloys]] can stretch up to 8% of their length and still return to their original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This property, known as superelasticity or pseudoelasticity, is a misnomer as the material is not operating in its elastic regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

In this case, the [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]] is in the austenite phase, with its transition temperature lower than room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Applying stress, even without a temperature change, forces the crystal structure to transform from austenite to detwinned martensite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This rearrangement allows for significant deformation. When the stress is removed, the atoms spring back to the austenite phase, returning the material to its original shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. The audible "pinging" sound produced during this process indicates the stress-induced phase change occurring in the solid state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

When the material transforms from the higher symmetry austenite phase to the lower symmetry martensite phase, it releases heat, acting as an exothermic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Conversely, when stress is removed and the material returns to austenite, the phase change is endothermic, absorbing heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This phenomenon is being applied in a field called elastocalorics for heat pumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## Applications

Due to their unique properties, [[nitinol_metal_properties | shape memory alloys]] are used in a variety of applications:

### Medical Devices
[[nitinol_metal_properties | Nitinol]] is ideal for medical devices like stents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:11:50]</a>. Stents are slightly cooled to the martensite phase, crushed or elongated to be thin, then inserted via a catheter into the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Upon deployment, the material bounces back to its original shape, opening arteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Actuators
[[nitinol_metal_properties | Shape memory alloys]] can generate significant forces when heated, making them useful as actuators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. A small wire of [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]] can generate over 20 pounds (90 newtons) of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Scientists have even used them to fracture rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### Aviation
Shape memory alloys are being investigated for use in aviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Vortex Generators**: Small fins on plane wings that create turbulence to keep airflow attached during takeoff and landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. When a plane climbs from takeoff to cruise, the temperature drops from ground temperature to -50째C to -60째C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. By designing the alloy to transition at these temperatures, the vortex generators can autonomously stow flat during cruise when not needed, reducing drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. They then pop back up as the plane descends for landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Main Flaps**: This principle has been extended to operate main aircraft flaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Heating elements actively control the [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]] tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Two [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]] tubes can replace complex hydraulic systems on a 737 aircraft wing box, allowing flaps to move from 60 degrees down to 30 degrees up in flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

### Tires
[[nitinol_metal_properties | Shape memory alloys]] are enabling the reinvention of wheels for space exploration and terrestrial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

*   **Bulletproof Bicycle Tires**: These tires, originating from NASA research, use [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]] springs inside a polymer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. They do not require air pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Their structure and shock absorption are provided by the metal springs, allowing them to withstand punctures from nails or even bullets without losing performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

*   **NASA Rover Wheels**: Traditional rubber pneumatic tires are unsuitable for the Moon and Mars due to low atmospheric pressure (causing them to explode) and extreme temperature fluctuations (causing rubber to become brittle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Hard metal wheels, like those on the Curiosity rover made from machined aluminum, are light but still prone to damage and cracking on aggressive terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

    *   **Limitations of Traditional Metals**: Normal metals deform plastically and won't return to shape if subjected to strain greater than 0.3% to 0.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This can lead to holes and cracks, as seen on Mars rover wheels, compromising performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   **Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) Wheels**: These wheels used a pantograph structure of woven wires with an internal "bump stop" to prevent deformation beyond the proportional limit and avoid plasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. While effective for short missions, this design still experiences degradation over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
    *   **[[nitinol_metal_properties | Nitinol]] Wheels for Space**: NASA's [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]] tires are designed to last the entire lifetime of a rover mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. They are constructed by tediously weaving [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]] springs into a mesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
        *   **Enhanced Load Carrying**: By tying a "bump stop" element to the mesh, load transfer is distributed 360 degrees around the tire, significantly increasing load-carrying capacity without adding mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
        *   **Integrated Suspension**: The superelastic property allows the tire to act as a damper, dissipating energy and potentially becoming a complete suspension system, simplifying vehicle design for space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
        *   **Extensive Testing**: These wheels are tested extensively on terrain endurance rigs that simulate different lunar and Martian surfaces like sand and rocks, at slow speeds similar to Mars rovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. They can support the weight of a vehicle and crew while deforming up to 8% without permanent damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

*   **Terrestrial Applications**: Beyond space, [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]] tires are being developed for earthly vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
    *   **Jeep Application**: A [[nitinol_metal_properties | nitinol]] tire has been tested on a Jeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Since it doesn't rely on pressurized air, it cannot get a flat tire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
    *   **Aircraft Tires**: Conventional aircraft tires require very high pressurization (300-400 psi), which poses risks of explosion and demands constant maintenance to check air pressure for fuel efficiency and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. A structural system using [[nitinol_metal_properties | shape memory alloys]] would eliminate these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

The development of these [[design_and_production_of_compliant_mechanisms | compliant mechanisms]] using [[nitinol_metal_properties | shape memory alloys]] highlights their transformative potential across diverse fields, from [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | robotic engineering]] to everyday products.

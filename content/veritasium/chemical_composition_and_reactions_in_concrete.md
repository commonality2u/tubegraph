## Cement Versus Concrete
The terms "[[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | cement]]" and "concrete" are often confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Cement** acts as the glue or matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Concrete** is made by combining cement with aggregates like gravel and sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Cement is the most important man-made substance on the planet, used more than any other substance apart from water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is essentially [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | liquid rock]] that can be poured into any shape, offering strength, durability, and affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Historical Development of Cement Chemistry
People have been making versions of cement for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, leading to the [[historical_development_of_concrete | historical development of concrete]].

### Primitive Cement
The key ingredient for primitive cement is **limestone**, which is primarily calcium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
1.  **Heating**: When limestone is heated to around 1,000 degrees Celsius, CO2 is driven off the rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, leaving **calcium oxide** (also known as quicklime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  **Mixing with water**: Grinding the calcium oxide and mixing it with water results in an exothermic reaction that produces **calcium hydroxide** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  **Hardening**: Over time, this mixture absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere, reverting to calcium carbonate as water evaporates, which causes it to harden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Drawbacks of primitive cement include limitations on mold size (due to CO2 penetration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> and inability to harden underwater (where there is no CO2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Roman Concrete
The Romans discovered a solution to these drawbacks, leading to [[roman_concrete_versus_modern_concrete | Roman concrete's unique properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. They added **pozzolana** (volcanic ash) to crushed limestone before heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This created a stronger, more durable cement that could harden underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The Pantheon, the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome, was built with this material and has stood for 2,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

The secret behind this was the presence of **silica** in pozzolana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Silica fundamentally changes the chemistry of the cement, allowing it to harden without drying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The water becomes an integral part of the hardened concrete, meaning it achieves maximum strength when setting underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Modern Concrete: Portland Cement
Today, most concrete uses a cement formulation discovered in the 1840s, known as **Portland cement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Its name is a marketing term, referring to the gray color's resemblance to desirable rocks quarried near Portland, England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Portland cement is made by crushing limestone and mixing it with a percentage of **shale or clay** to provide the necessary silicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This mixture is ground into a fine powder and heated in a kiln to very high temperatures, producing hard nodules called **clinker** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. While clinker was once considered waste due to its hardness, grinding it down produces a cement far superior to other chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

The most common compound within Portland cement is **tricalcium silicate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Concrete Hardening: Cement Hydration
The hardening process of concrete is called **cement hydration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
1.  **Dissolution**: When water is added to the dry mixture of gravel, sand, and cement powder, it starts dissolving the cement powder grains, releasing ions into solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
2.  **Basic Solution**: Some of these ions are calcium hydroxide, making concrete a very basic (alkaline) solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The pH of concrete can reach 12 or 13, making it corrosive to skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
3.  **Crystal Formation**: As tricalcium silicate (the most common compound in cement) reacts with water, crystals of **calcium silicate hydrates** and other hydrate minerals begin to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
4.  **Interlocking Structure**: These crystals grow and become interlocking, which causes the concrete to harden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Water is essential to this process and becomes part of the solid material, rather than evaporating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This is why freshly poured concrete should be kept in a damp environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Role of Aggregates in Strength
While cement is the "glue" and most expensive component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, adding aggregates (sand and gravel) is crucial for strength and cost-effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Surprisingly, cylinders of pure cement, cement with sand, and cement with sand and gravel (normal concrete mix) break under similar pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. However, pure cement tends to flake and chip more under load, indicating that aggregates help the material cohere and stay together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. By reducing cement content to about 30% of the mix, the same strength characteristics can be achieved more cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Additives and Consistency
To achieve the desired consistency without adding too much water (which can affect strength) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, modern concrete often uses chemical admixtures like **superplasticizers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. These make the concrete easier to work and spread without significantly changing its water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

Certain substances can also affect the setting time of concrete. For example, the sugars in carbonated beverages like Coke can prevent the setting process, buying a few hours in emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## Environmental Impact and Origin
Cement production is a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions, estimated at 8% of the total, more than the entire aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. This highlights the [[environmental_impact_and_carbon_footprint_of_concrete_production | environmental impact and carbon footprint of concrete production]].

The core component of cement and concrete, limestone, originates from the compressed skeletons and shells of ancient sea organisms that died millions of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Thus, skyscrapers and other large-scale infrastructure are, in a sense, made of ancient marine life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

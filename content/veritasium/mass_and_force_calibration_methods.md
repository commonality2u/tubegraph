Accurate measurement of force is crucial across many fields, from an apple's weight (approximately 1 newton) to jet engine thrust (570,000 newtons) and the Saturn V rocket's thrust (33,360,000 newtons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. [[measurement_of_large_forces | Measuring large forces]] accurately requires specialized equipment and precise calibration techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Dead Weight Machine

Rick Seifarth, a physical scientist in the Mass and Force Group, manages a dead weight machine used for [[calibrating_force_sensors_and_transducers | calibrating force sensors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This machine can apply a force of 4,448,222 newtons, which precisely equals 1,000,000 pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It comprises twenty 50,000-pound increments, cumulatively reaching 4.45 meganewtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This facility is believed to calibrate the largest mass objects anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. While this machine has a 1 million pound (4.45 meganewton) capacity, other similar machines can reach 13.3 meganewtons (3 million pounds force), making it the biggest machine of its type in the world and unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### How it Works

The machine operates with 20 carefully calibrated masses located below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
1.  A force sensor (also called a force transducer) is placed on a compression head in the lab upstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  A hydraulic ram in the attic raises a green lifting frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
3.  When the force transducer contacts a red loading frame, it begins lifting the weights downstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
4.  As the lifting frame continues to rise, more of the 50,000-pound weights become suspended by the force sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
5.  Since the force generated by these weights is precisely known, the readouts from the force transducer can be accurately calibrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

These calibrated devices are then used in the field, for instance, embedded in test stands to monitor forces during rocket firings, ensuring power levels are precisely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Precision in Mass Calibration

Minimizing uncertainty is paramount in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Each 50,000-pound mass, equivalent to ten minivans, is known to within a few American nickels (approximately 50,036.27 pounds of mass) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Calibration Chain

This minute uncertainty is established by calibrating masses against the fundamental mass standard, K20, which is the United States' primary kilogram standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The process involves a step-by-step comparison:
1.  Starting with K20, combinations of known smaller weights (e.g., a single 5-kilogram mass compared to two 2-kilogram and one 1-kilogram mass) are used to determine the exact value of larger unknown weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
2.  The calibration transitions from kilograms to pounds, working from 50-pound masses to 500 pounds, then 2500 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
3.  Using a scale in the floor, the calibration extends to 10,000 pounds, then 20,000, and finally 30,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
4.  Combinations of these massive weights are then used to calibrate the 50,000-pound masses forming the dead weight machine's stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Accounting for Environmental Factors

The vertical force vector generated by these weights in a gravitational field is guaranteed with an uncertainty of 0.0005%, or five parts per million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This means at a full 1,000,000 pounds of applied force, the accuracy is within five pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Achieving this level of precision requires accounting for several factors:

*   **Accurate Mass Calibration:** The individual masses themselves must be precisely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **[[gravity_and_buoyancy_effects_on_largescale_mass_measurements | Gravitational Acceleration]]:** The local gravitational acceleration at the machine's location must be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. It is slightly less than Earth's standard gravity, requiring an additional 600 pounds to be added to the total weight to achieve the desired force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **[[gravity_and_buoyancy_effects_on_largescale_mass_measurements | Buoyant Force]]:** The masses displace 125 pounds of air, creating an upward buoyant force that must be counteracted. An additional 125 pounds must be added to the total to reach a million pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Importance of Physical Testing

The existence of such a precise machine highlights the necessity of direct physical testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The axiom "one physical test is worth a thousand expert opinions" holds true in physical testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. When it comes to applications like aerospace, such as building airplanes, [[importance_of_accurate_force_measurement_in_aerospace | minimizing uncertainty]] in force measurements is paramount, with uncertainties ideally "down in the mud" rather than, for example, 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

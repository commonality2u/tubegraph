## Understanding Ionizing Radiation

A Geiger counter measures [[understanding_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]], which is radiation possessing enough energy to remove electrons from atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Exposure to more than two Sieverts (Sv) of this type of radiation at once is likely fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Everyday Exposure

Despite the danger, humans are constantly exposed to low levels of [[understanding_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

*   **Bananas**: Eating a banana, rich in naturally radioactive potassium, exposes an individual to approximately 0.1 microSieverts (µSv) of [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Human Proximity**: Being near other people results in minor [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] exposure, as humans themselves become slightly radioactive from eating bananas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This dose is considered insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Natural Background Radiation**: The Earth's natural [[background_radiation_levels_globally | background radiation]] comes from soil, rocks, air, and even space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The global average for [[background_radiation_levels_globally | background radiation levels globally]] typically ranges between 0.1 and 0.2 microSieverts per hour (µSv/hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For example, Sydney's level is about 0.15 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Places with Elevated Radiation Levels

While there are places with significantly higher [[background_radiation_levels_globally | background radiation levels globally]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, some specific [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | radioactive sites]] have unique characteristics:

*   **Hiroshima Peace Dome**: Nearly 70 years after the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city, the [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] level here is approximately 0.3 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Uranium Mine (Marie Curie's Source)**: An old uranium mine, where uranium was discovered and Marie Curie sourced her raw material, measures about 17 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This is about 10 times the natural [[background_radiation_levels_globally | background radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Small pieces of fluorescent uranium ore can still be found in the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Marie Curie's Lab**: Specific items in Marie Curie's former lab and office, like a doorknob and the back of her chair, still show elevated [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] levels. The doorknob reads about 10 times the [[background_radiation_levels_globally | background radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Her chair still emits alpha particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, likely due to traces of radium she left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Trinity Bomb Test Site**: The site of the world's first nuclear bomb detonation in New Mexico, which vaporized the area and fused desert sand into green glass called "trinitite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The general [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] level is around 8 µSv/hour, with trinitite itself being slightly more radioactive at 2-3 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Airplanes**: Due to less atmospheric shielding from [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation_and_space_missions | cosmic rays]] at higher altitudes, [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] levels inside an airplane increase significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>:
    *   18,000 feet: up to 0.5 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
    *   23,000 feet: up to 1 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
    *   33,000 feet: over 2 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
    *   Even higher altitudes and towards the poles: over 3 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   **Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor Number Four**: The site of the 1986 meltdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Current [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] readings are around 5 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Staying for an hour would result in a dose similar to a dental x-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Levels are not extremely high because meters of topsoil were removed and disposed of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Fukushima Exclusion Zone**: Levels increase as one approaches the zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.# Radiation Exposure in Daily Life and Occupations

*   **Fukushima Exclusion Zone**: Levels increase as one approaches the zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The Japanese are undertaking similar [[environmental_monitoring_through_standard_materials | environmental monitoring]] efforts to Chernobyl, collecting meters of topsoil into black bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Although the initial release of radioactive material was only about 10% of Chernobyl's, its freshness (3 years post-accident) means less decay, leading to readings of 5 to 10 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Wearing a mask is recommended to prevent inhalation of radioactive dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Pripyat Hospital Basement (Chernobyl)**: The most radioactive place visited in the video, and one of the most radioactive places on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This basement holds the highly contaminated clothing of firefighters who responded to the Chernobyl disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Readings just outside the door can reach 500 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, and within the room, up to 1,500 µSv/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. One hour in this basement would result in a dose of 2,000 µSv, equivalent to a year's worth of natural [[background_radiation_levels_globally | background radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Occupational and Medical Exposure Comparisons

Different activities and professions result in varying levels of [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation exposure]]:

*   **CT Scan**: A patient receives approximately 7,000 µSv during a CT scan, which is equivalent to 3 years of natural [[background_radiation_levels_globally | background radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Fukushima Residents**: People living near Fukushima are estimated to receive an additional 10,000 µSv over their lifetime due to the nuclear disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **US Radiation Workers**: These workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 µSv per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Astronauts**: An astronaut on the International Space Station for 6 months receives about 80,000 µSv of [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Smoker's Lungs**: The highest levels of [[understanding_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]] exposure discussed are found in a smoker's lungs, averaging 160,000 µSv per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This is due to radioactive polonium and [[impact_of_tetraethyl_lead_on_global_health | radioactive lead]] present in tobacco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Smokers are thus exposed to high levels of [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]], in addition to carcinogens and toxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

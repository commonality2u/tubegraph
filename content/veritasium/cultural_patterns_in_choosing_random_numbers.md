From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

When people are asked to name a random number, they often exhibit non-random patterns in their choices, with the number 37 frequently emerging as a popular selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that human perception of randomness is not truly random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## The Blue-Seven Phenomenon

Psychologists have identified a pattern where people reliably select blue and 7 most often when asked to pick a color and a number across various cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:31">[01:41:31]</a>. This pattern is known as the [[the_psychology_of_random_number_selection | blue-seven phenomenon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. It has been suggested that the equivalent of this phenomenon for numbers between 1 and 100 is the number 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>.

## Testing the Theory

Initial observations and historical references support the idea that 37 is a preferred "random" number:
*   Interviews with numerous people asking for a random number between 1 and 100 revealed that 37 was a very common answer, especially for two-digit numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   There is a professional magic trick called "The 37 Force" that relies on an audience member reliably picking 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   The famous Stanford MIT Jargon File, which chronicles hacker slang, lists 37 as the random number of choice for computer programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. It states that "When groups of people are polled to pick a random number between 1 and 100, the most commonly chosen number is 37" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   While formal polls on this theory are rare, a Reddit poll of 1,380 people from four years prior found 69 to be the most popular number, followed by 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## The Largest Random Number Survey

To investigate this phenomenon further, the largest random number survey ever was conducted, receiving 200,000 responses to the question "pick a random number between 1 and 100" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   The results showed consistent patterns, suggesting that people worldwide perceive random numbers in a particular, non-random way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   Excluding extremes (1, 100) and culturally significant numbers (42, 69), the numbers that stood out as most "random" were 7, 73, 77, and 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   When people were asked to pick the number they thought the *fewest others* would pick, the results were even clearer: 73 and 37 were nearly tied as the most selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
*   The actual least-picked numbers in the first survey were multiples of 10 (90, 30, 40, 70, 80, 60), which apparently don't feel random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   This evidence ironically suggests that 37 and its inversion, 73, are not random at all in human selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

## Why 37? Perceived Randomness

One argument for 37's prevalence is how people perceive randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
*   Numbers like 50 are considered "too contrived" or "too central" to be random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.
*   People generally think odd numbers are more random than even numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   Single digits like 5, 9, and 1 are seen as too extreme, leading people to gravitate towards digits 3 and 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   This is supported by the fact that the top numbers in the survey, including 37, 73, and 77, all consisted of the digits 3 and 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

## Why 37? Mathematical Uniqueness

There is also a mathematical case for 37 being humanity's number of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
*   [[mathematical_uniqueness_of_prime_numbers | Prime numbers]] feel like the most random numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. Even composite numbers like 39 feel less random than 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   **Reasons primes feel random:**
    *   They don't appear as frequently in daily life (e.g., pixel counts, fruit boxes, square footage are often composite numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
    *   There is no simple formula to find the next prime number; one must check every subsequent number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. The Prime Number Theorem provides an approximation (nth prime number occurs around n times natural log of n), but it's not exact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
*   **Median Second Prime Factor:** 37 stands out as the median second prime factor of all numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. This means that half of all numbers (from 1 to infinity) have a second prime factor of 37 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. This concept involves calculating the probability of a prime being the second smallest factor for a given number, and summing these probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

## Other Remarkable Qualities of 37

37 holds many unique classifications as a prime number:
*   It is an irregular prime, a Cuban prime, a lucky prime, a sexy prime, a permutable prime, and a Padovan prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
*   A personal anecdote describes learning 37 was prime as a toddler from a book that simply stated "It's a prime number. Nothing goes into it. Someday, you'll understand," fostering a lifelong fascination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
*   There are also mathematical tricks involving 37, such as a property that if a number is a multiple of 37 (like 37 squared = 1369), and you reverse it, then stick a zero between every digit (9060301), that new number is also a multiple of 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. There are also tricks for determining if a six-digit number is divisible by 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

## The 37% Rule (Secretary Problem)

Beyond perceived and mathematical properties, 37 plays a practical role in optimal decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. In situations where choices are immediate and final (e.g., renting an apartment, accepting a job offer, picking a gas station), and you cannot assess all options at once, the "37% rule" provides an optimal strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
*   The strategy involves exploring and automatically rejecting the first 37% of available options to gather information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.
*   After this exploration phase, one should then pick the first subsequent option that is better than all previous ones seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.
*   Using this method, the chance of success (picking the best option) is also approximately 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.
*   This mathematical problem is known as the [[probability_theory_in_problem_solving | secretary problem]] or the [[strategies_in_repeated_games | marriage problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>. It can be applied to hiring employees or choosing a life partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.
*   The 37% rule also applies to time; for example, if one plans to marry in 10 years, they could spend the first 3.7 years exploring options before selecting the next best person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

The formula for calculating the probability of selecting the best option ($P$) based on a stopping point $S$ out of $N$ options is given by:
$P = \frac{S}{N} \sum_{i=S}^{N-1} \frac{1}{i}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>
This sum approximates to $\frac{S}{N} \ln(\frac{N}{S})$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.
Maximizing this probability by setting its derivative to 0 yields $\ln(\frac{S}{N}) = -1$, which means $\frac{S}{N} = \frac{1}{e}$, or approximately 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.

## The All-Pervasive 37

The number 37 appears widely in various contexts, leading some to collect instances of its appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. One individual has collected instances of 37 for over 40 years, maintaining a website dedicated to the number since 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>. This interest was sparked by a comedy routine by Charles Fleischer, who rattled off various "coincidences" involving 37, such as:
*   37 holes in the speaker part of a telephone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.
*   Shakespeare wrote 37 plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>.
*   37 movements in Beethoven's Nine Symphonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>.

This pervasive presence contributes to the collective subconscious recognition of 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The number 37 holds a significant, albeit often subconscious, place in our collective minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>. It is humanity's go-to random number, a prominent [[mathematical_uniqueness_of_prime_numbers | prime number]], and an ideal figure for making decisions based on [[probability_theory_in_problem_solving | probability theory in problem solving]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>. This combination of psychological perception, mathematical properties, and practical utility likely contributes to our natural gravitation toward it, making it "feel right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.

The Pyro Board is an advanced, two-dimensional version of a Rubens tube, designed to visualize standing waves in flammable gas using flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## How it Works
A traditional Rubens tube is a pipe with multiple holes, where flammable gas is pumped in and lit, creating a row of Bunsen burners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. When sounds are played into the tube, standing waves are formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These waves create areas of high vibration (anti-nodes) and low vibration (nodes) within the air inside the tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This vibration pattern affects the flow rate of gas escaping the holes, which in turn influences the height of the flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Thus, the standing wave pattern becomes visible through the varying flame heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

The Pyro Board takes this concept to the "next level" by creating an entire "plane of Bunsen burners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The specific Pyro Board demonstrated features 2,500 holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Creation and Purpose
A team of physics and chemistry demonstrators in Denmark developed the Pyro Board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. They were inspired by their enjoyment of the original Rubens tube and the belief that "when you put on more fire, then it always gets better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Their primary purpose is to demonstrate physics concepts to children around Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Demonstrations
During a demonstration, the Pyro Board showcased several phenomena:
*   **Fundamental Standing Wave**: By lowering the frequency, the team could find the lowest frequency that produces a standing wave, known as the fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Varying Volume**: Adjusting the volume of the sound input caused dramatic visual changes in the flame patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Higher Frequencies**: Increasing the frequency created more complex and intense standing wave patterns, which could be quite loud and even painful to the ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Music Visualization**: Playing music with a strong bass rhythm through the speaker transformed the flames into a dynamic visual representation of the sound waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Auditory Observations
During the demonstration, it was noted that the sound pressure in different locations corresponded to the flame heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. An observer could hear when they were in a "node" (area of minimal sound vibration) or an "anti-node" (area of maximum sound vibration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The flames were observed to be highest in the anti-nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

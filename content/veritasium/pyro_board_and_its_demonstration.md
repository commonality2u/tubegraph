The Pyro Board is an advanced, two-dimensional version of the classic Ruben's tube, effectively creating "a whole plane of Bunsen burners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It serves as an impressive visual demonstration of sound waves and their properties, primarily [[applying_physics_in_educational_demonstrations | applying physics in educational demonstrations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Principle of Operation

Like a traditional Ruben's tube, the Pyro Board operates by pumping a flammable gas into a chamber with numerous small holes and lighting the gas as it escapes, forming a row of flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. When sounds are played into the chamber, they create standing waves within the contained gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Standing waves consist of areas where there is significant air vibration (anti-nodes) and areas where there is minimal vibration (nodes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. These variations in air pressure and vibration directly affect the flow rate of the gas escaping through the holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, consequently altering the height of the flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The flames are highest at the anti-nodes where vibration is greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This allows for a visual representation of the standing wave pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Construction

The Pyro Board distinguishes itself by its scale, featuring 2,500 individual holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, allowing for a two-dimensional visualization of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Its creators reasoned that "when you put on more fire, then it always gets better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Demonstration

During a demonstration, the Pyro Board is lit, revealing 2,500 small flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. By adjusting the frequency of the sound played into the board, different standing wave patterns can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Fundamental Frequency

The lowest frequency that produces a standing wave in the board is considered the fundamental frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, forming a basic, distinct pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Varying Frequencies

As the sound frequency is increased, more complex standing wave patterns emerge, with multiple nodes and anti-nodes visible across the plane of flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Auditory Observation

An interesting phenomenon observed during demonstrations is the ability to audibly distinguish between nodes and anti-nodes. Standing in an anti-node allows one to hear the sound clearly, while moving to a node results in a noticeable reduction in sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This directly correlates with the flame heights, as flames are highest at the anti-nodes where sound pressure is greatest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Music Integration

The Pyro Board can also visualize music, particularly tracks with strong bass, as the fluctuating sound waves create dynamic flame patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Educational Outreach

The Pyro Board is used by a team of physics and chemistry demonstrators in Denmark to educate children about physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. They also showcase other [[experimental_demonstrations_in_physics | experimental demonstrations in physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

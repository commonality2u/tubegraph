In [[Principle of least action in classical and quantum mechanics | classical mechanics]], knowing a system's state, such as a particle's position and velocity, allows for future calculations using Newton's second law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Similarly, in [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]], the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] of a particle enables future state predictions using the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] typically spreads out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. There is a "beautiful symmetry" in how an initial state can evolve smoothly and continuously into the future via an equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The fundamental challenge in [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] is that the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] is never directly observed in its spread-out form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Instead, measurements consistently find the particle at a single point in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This presents the "measurement problem": how to reconcile the smoothly evolving, spread-out [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] with the localized particle detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Interpretation of the Wave Function

The founders of quantum theory prioritized the observed measurement over the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]], as measurements matched the experience of a world composed of matter particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While Schrodinger formulated his [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave equation]] based on the suspicion that matter has [[De Broglies hypothesis and waveparticle duality | wave-like properties]] (notably supported by De Broglie) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, it was Max Born who proposed how to interpret the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Born suggested that squaring the complex amplitude of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] at any point in space yields the probability of finding the particle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This "Born rule" introduced probability into the core of reality, making the universe non-deterministic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Despite discomfort from scientists like Einstein, the Born rule remains central to [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] due to its predictive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Under this established view, [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] operates under two rules:
*   When unobserved, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] evolves according to the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   When a measurement is made, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | collapses]] suddenly and irreversibly, with the probability of an outcome given by the squared amplitude of its associated [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Schrodinger's Cat Thought Experiment

Schrodinger himself disliked this two-rule formulation, leading him to devise the famous Schrodinger's Cat thought experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The experiment places a cat in a box with a radioactive atom, a radiation detector, and a cyanide gas release mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The atom's decay triggers the gas, killing the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The purpose was to magnify the atom's quantum state to a macroscopic, tangible level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Since the cat and detector are tied to the atom's state, they become [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entangled]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. According to [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]], the atom is in a [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] of both decayed and not-decayed states simultaneously (assuming no measurements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] propagates through the entanglement with the detector and then the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Consequently, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] of everything in the box becomes a [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] of "atom not decayed, cat alive" and "atom decayed, cat dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Under the standard interpretation, the cat is genuinely both alive and dead until the box is opened, at which point the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | collapses]], and the cat becomes definitively dead or alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Schrodinger's intent was to demonstrate that this formulation of [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] was flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Components of Schrodinger's Cat and Their Validity

To find a better way to think about Schrodinger's Cat and [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]], three essential components are examined: [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]], [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entanglement]], and measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Superposition
[[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | Superposition]] is the idea that quantum objects can exist in multiple states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This is indirectly observed in the double-slit experiment, where individual electrons appear to pass through both slits at once, creating an interference pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This behavior is easily understood with waves, where peaks and troughs interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Since electrons are represented by a [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] when unobserved, the double-slit experiment provides concrete evidence that this wave allows electrons to pass through both slits simultaneously, placing [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] on "solid ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Entanglement
[[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | Entanglement]] occurs when particles interact and are subsequently described by a single [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. For example, if two electrons scatter, their individual trajectories are probabilistic, but measuring the momentum of one instantly reveals the momentum of the other due to conservation laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Before measurement, each electron's momentum was in a [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The measurement of one instantaneously [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | collapsed]] the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] of the other, even if they were light-years apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This shared [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] explains why measuring one particle affects the state of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Rigorously, there is only one [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]]: that of the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Individual [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave functions]] are only applicable to isolated, unentangled particles; once they interact, [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entanglement]] is the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## The Many Worlds Interpretation

Given the robustness of [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] and [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entanglement]], the only remaining component to question is the measurement postulate, which was added to connect the mathematics of [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] to observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. It seems "weird" to have different rules for system evolution when observed versus unobserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Since measurement is simply the interaction of two quantum systems, their [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave functions]] should evolve according to the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] without a separate collapse rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

If the measurement rule is removed, then in the Schrodinger's Cat experiment, the [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] of the atom becomes [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with the detector and then the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Since observers are also made of quantum particles, opening the box does not involve a measurement or [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Instead, the observer simply becomes [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with the state of everything inside the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This leads to the observer seeing both a live cat and a dead cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The solution proposed by the [[Implications and objections to the many worlds theory | Many Worlds Interpretation]] (MWI), formulated by Hugh Everett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, is that the observer who sees the cat alive and the observer who sees it dead inhabit "separate worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. These realities will never interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Environmental Decoherence and Branching
The creation of these separate worlds is attributed to *environmental decoherence* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. If a quantum object in [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] becomes [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with its environment (e.g., air molecules, photons), it undergoes decoherence, which branches the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] of the universe, effectively splitting it into slightly different copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

A more realistic account of Schrodinger's Cat under MWI:
1.  The radioactive atom evolves into a [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] of decayed and not-decayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
2.  The detector becomes [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with this [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
3.  Almost immediately, the detector becomes [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with the environment (air molecules, photons) due to their differing interactions based on the detector's state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
4.  This interaction causes the detector to decohere, branching the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
5.  At that moment, the observer (and the cat) are split into two identical copies, each [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with one outcome of the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
6.  When the observer opens the box, the cat is already alive or dead in that specific branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The observer is unaware that the other outcome also happened to a different version of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Advantages of Many Worlds
The [[Implications and objections to the many worlds theory | Many Worlds Interpretation]] suggests that [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] branching happens constantly, possibly infinitely often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. While this may seem implausible, all these worlds are naturally part of the mathematics of [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]]; getting rid of them requires an ad-hoc concept like [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. MWI posits that our experience of reality would be the same as if the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | collapsed]], but the formalism is much cleaner and more elegant, with only [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave functions]] evolving under the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

MWI implies that the founders of quantum theory may have been mistaken in prioritizing measurement; the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] is the complete picture of reality, and our measurement is just a tiny fraction of it, the part we become [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Furthermore, under MWI, the universe reverts to being deterministic, as every outcome happens 100% of the time, though we only experience our sliver of the multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Common Questions and Objections to Many Worlds

Physicist Sean Carroll, author of "Something Deeply Hidden," addresses common questions about the [[Implications and objections to the many worlds theory | Many Worlds Interpretation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>:

### Energy Conservation
Energy is "100 percent super-duper conserved" for the entire [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The branching isn't about duplicating the universe, but subdividing a certain amount of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The pieces appear identical from the inside but contribute less to the total energy of everything than the original before splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### How Many Worlds and How Frequently Do They Branch?
The exact number of worlds and branching frequency is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Branching occurs whenever a quantum system in [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | superposition]] becomes [[Concepts of superposition and entanglement | entangled]] with its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. For example, radioactive decay in the human body happens about 5,000 times a second, with each decay leading to a branching of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Whether the total number of possible branches is infinite or finite is currently unknown, hinging on deeper understanding of quantum gravity and cosmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. However, the number is certainly "ginormous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Misconception: Everything That Could Possibly Happen, Happens
This is not true in MWI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. MWI states that the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] obeys the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]], which predicts many potential occurrences but not *everything* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. For instance, an electron will never spontaneously convert into a proton because the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | Schrodinger equation]] gives zero probability to events that violate fundamental conservation laws (e.g., conservation of mass, charge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. While there might be a world where a version of you is president, it would be a "very low amplitude world" (low probability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Analogy to Classical Universe
> Carroll draws an analogy to the classical universe: we only see a finite amount of the universe due to the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. If the universe is infinitely large and uniform, there would be infinite copies of people doing all sorts of things (e.g., winning NBA championships, being supermodels) just due to the shuffling of atoms, irrespective of [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This concept, existing in classical physics, is similarly unsettling but not inherently more ridiculous than quantum branching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. A human cognitive bias might cause people to focus on extremely low probability events rather than accept their negligible likelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

### Instantaneous Branching
Whether branching happens instantly across all of space or spreads out at the speed of light is a matter of description, not physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Both descriptions yield identical predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. This is because "God doesn't know about branches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>; only the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] of the universe truly exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Breaking the [[Quantum mechanics and wave functions | wave function]] into "branches" or "worlds" is a human convenience for understanding, not a fundamental property built into the fabric of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This is akin to describing air in a room by temperature and pressure rather than listing every molecule's position and velocity – it's a convenient but not full description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

Swimming in a body of water covered by thousands of floating shade balls presents unique challenges and observations regarding buoyancy, drag, and physical exertion. The experiment to swim in shade balls was prompted by public curiosity following a video about the [[purpose_of_shade_balls_in_reservoirs | shade balls]] on an LA reservoir, where many people questioned if it was possible to swim in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Safety Concerns and Acquisition

The manufacturer of the shade balls explicitly does not recommend swimming in them due to potential dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. They regularly refuse requests from residential customers, and initially, they were unwilling to sell the balls for this experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The primary reason for their inherent danger is that they are half-full of water, making them heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. A single bag of 1,200 shade balls weighs 300 kilograms (660 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

For the experiment, 10,000 shade balls were purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The [[logistics_of_handling_and_distributing_shade_balls | logistics of handling]] this quantity proved challenging, requiring a U-Haul truck and a moving company to transport and release them into a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## [[impact_of_shade_balls_on_swimming_dynamics | Swimming Dynamics]] in a Single Layer

Initially, about 6,000 shade balls were released, forming a single layer that nearly covered the entire pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The balls naturally arranged themselves into close-packed crystal structures with boundaries between these "grains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Observations from a Single Layer

-   **Buoyancy and Feeling:** Floating among the balls felt "incredible," akin to being in a ball pit, with little sensation of water underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, it quickly became "like quicksand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
-   **Light Penetration:** Despite their purpose to block sunlight, a surprising amount of light still penetrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This is because even when tightly packed, spheres only cover approximately 91% of the water surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Light passing through the cracks and reflecting off the balls creates interesting patterns on the pool's bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
-   **Noise:** Swimming through shade balls generates significant noise close to the head, making it nearly impossible to hear anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
-   **Drag:** [[the_science_behind_shade_balls | The science behind]] the resistance experienced when swimming in shade balls relates to drag, the force that opposes motion through a fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Drag is typically proportional to velocity squared (VÂ²), meaning that the faster a swimmer moves, the more balls they encounter per second and the faster these balls move relative to the swimmer, increasing their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
-   **Stroke Challenges:**
    -   **Breaststroke:** Possible, but results in "a lot of balls into the face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    -   **Front Crawl/Freestyle:** Made the swimmer feel "knocked around like in a rock tumbler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, resulting in an "extra workout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    -   **Butterfly:** Even more challenging, as it requires pushing balls not only forward but also down, up, and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_swimming_in_multi_layer_shade_balls | Swimming Challenges]] in Multiple Layers

After testing a single layer, an additional 3,600 shade balls were added to create multiple layers, mimicking the coverage of the LA reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Observations from Multiple Layers

-   **Floating on Top:** Attempts to run or slide across the surface of the multi-layered shade balls were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Each shade ball, being almost half full of water, can only support around 300 grams when fully submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. To support an adult body entirely above the water, more than 260 shade balls would need to be trapped underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
-   **Difficulty Swimming:** It was initially believed that swimming was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. While an "unorthodox style" of swimming mostly beneath the balls allowed some movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, traditional strokes like butterfly were severely hampered, with swimmers unable to "go anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
-   **Solid-like Behavior:** Unlike in a single layer where balls could easily move past each other, multiple layers cause the balls to trap against each other, acting "more like a solid" and providing "significantly more resistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
-   **"Quicksand" Effect:** When still on the surface, floating feels "incredible" and like being in a ball pit, with little perception of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. However, movement causes the balls to gain enough energy to shift, leading to a sinking sensation, "exactly like quicksand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Conclusion

The experiment demonstrated the extreme difficulty and potential hazards of swimming in shade balls, particularly in multiple layers. The immense drag, noise, and "quicksand" effect make it an impractical and dangerous activity.

Following the experiment, the 10,000 shade balls were planned to be signed and mailed out to Patreon supporters as a thank you for their support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

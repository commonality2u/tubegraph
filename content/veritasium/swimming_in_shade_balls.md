From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Inspired by public curiosity following a video about [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] on an [[purpose_and_function_of_shade_balls | LA reservoir]], a creator embarked on an experiment to determine if it's possible to swim in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Despite the initial thought that swimming in a drinking reservoir was obviously not allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, 10,000 [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] were purchased directly from the manufacturer to conduct a private test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Safety Concerns and Logistics

The manufacturer of the [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] explicitly advised against swimming in them, considering it "a bit dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. They regularly refuse requests from residential customers for this reason and initially did not want to sell the [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The inherent danger of [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] stems from them being half-full of water, making them heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. A bag of 1,200 [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] weighs 300 kilograms (660 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The 10,000 [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] required a U-Haul truck and a moving company for transport and deployment into a swimming pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Initially, 6,000 [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] were released, covering nearly the entire pool in a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. These [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | balls]] self-arranged into "crystal structures" with close packing and boundaries between "grains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Swimming in a Single Layer of Shade Balls

Upon entering the single layer of [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]], it was observed that swimming was possible, but challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Observations
*   **Light Penetration:** Despite their purpose to block [[impact_of_sunlight_on_water_quality | sunlight]], a surprising amount of light still gets through. This is because spheres, even when packed tightly, only cover about 91% of the water surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Light passing through cracks and reflecting off the [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | balls]] created interesting patterns on the pool's bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Noise:** [[Physical_challenges_of_moving_through_shade_balls | Moving through shade balls]] creates significant noise close to the head, making it almost impossible to hear anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Drag:** Swimming in [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] significantly increases drag, the force opposing motion through a fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If the [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] are considered particles of their own fluid, the faster one moves, the more [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | balls]] are encountered per second, and the faster they move relative to the swimmer, increasing their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This explains why drag is proportional to velocity squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Physical Impact:** Swimmers reported getting hit in the face with [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> and feeling "knocked around like in a rock tumbler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Swimming Strokes
*   **Breaststroke:** Possible, but results in many [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | balls]] hitting the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Front Crawl/Freestyle:** Attempting this stroke led to impacts, including a potential bloody lip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Butterfly:** This stroke proved even more challenging because it requires pushing the [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | balls]] forward, down, up, and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. It looked incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Swimming in Multiple Layers of Shade Balls

After determining that swimming was difficult but possible in a single layer, the remaining 3,600 [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] were added to create multiple layers, mimicking how most of the [[purpose_and_function_of_shade_balls | LA reservoir]] is covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Attempts to float or run across the surface of the multi-layered [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Each [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | ball]], being almost half full of water, only supports about 300 grams when fully submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. To support an average body entirely above the water, more than 260 [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] would be needed underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Sinking and "Quicksand" Effect
In multiple layers, the [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | balls]] get trapped against each other, acting more like a solid and providing significantly more resistance than in a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. While it initially feels like floating on a ball pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, the experience quickly turns into a "quicksand" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. If motionless on the surface, one can float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. However, once movement begins, the [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | balls]] gain enough energy to shift, causing the swimmer to sink deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Swimming in multiple layers is extremely difficult, bordering on impossible, requiring an "unorthodox style" mostly beneath the surface of the [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

The experiment demonstrated that while it is technically possible to perform some swimming strokes in a single layer of [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]], it is highly strenuous and potentially dangerous due to the physical impact of the [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | balls]] and increased drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Swimming in multiple layers of [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] is significantly harder, creating a quicksand-like effect where movement leads to sinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This highlights the [[physical_challenges_of_moving_through_shade_balls | physical challenges of moving through shade balls]]. The creator ultimately decided to sign and mail out all 10,000 [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] to Patreon supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

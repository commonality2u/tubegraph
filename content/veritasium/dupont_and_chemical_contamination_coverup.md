In 1929, a series of mysterious deaths in Chicago homes led authorities to discover that refrigerants used in early household refrigerators were toxic. These fridges relied on methyl chloride, an odorless and toxic gas, or flammable gases, posing a serious risk of poisoning or fire in homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This problem prompted a chemical company, DuPont, to seek a safer alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Discovery and Early Uses of Teflon

In 1936, DuPont tasked 27-year-old chemist [[history_of_teflon_and_its_discovery | Roy J. Plunkett]] with finding a non-toxic and non-flammable refrigerant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Plunkett was experimenting with tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), a gas made of double-bonded carbons, each linked to two fluorine atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. One morning, he discovered that a cylinder of TFE, though still weighing full, was empty of gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Upon cutting it open, he found a white, slippery powder inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Plunkett reasoned that the high pressure in the cylinder had caused TFE's double bonds to break, linking the molecules into long chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This process, called polymerization, transformed the gas into polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Initially, Plunkett wanted to discard the powder, but he decided to test it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. He found that it repelled water and resisted acids, bases, and all laboratory solvents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It was seemingly indestructible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The secret to PTFE's durability lies in the carbon-fluorine bond, the strongest single bond a carbon atom can form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Fluorine's electron-hungry nature and small size allow it to pull strongly on carbon's electrons, creating an electrostatic attraction that makes the bond incredibly robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This strong bond makes PTFE highly inert, meaning it hardly reacts with other substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Role in the [[postwar_legacy_of_oppenheimer_and_nuclear_arms_race | Manhattan Project]]

Despite its unique properties, Plunkett was unsure how to use this new material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. However, DuPont was involved in the [[postwar_legacy_of_oppenheimer_and_nuclear_arms_race | Manhattan Project]], refining uranium and plutonium for nuclear bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The process involved turning uranium into uranium hexafluoride, a highly corrosive gas that destroyed standard equipment like gaskets and seals in the Oak Ridge plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

DuPont realized PTFE's inertness made it ideal for handling uranium hexafluoride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. They compressed the PTFE powder into solid "cakes" that could be machined into gaskets and pipe linings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This "magic material" worked perfectly, with no known substitute considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The Army then used these PTFE components in fuel tanks and airplane engines to protect against oil and water, and in weapons manufacturing plants to handle corrosive nitric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

DuPont trademarked the material as Teflon in 1944 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Production Challenges and the Introduction of C8

Ramping up Teflon production at the Arlington, New Jersey plant proved difficult due to its insolubility and high thermal stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Polymerizing TFE is an exothermic reaction; if not controlled, the heat can cause TFE to rapidly decompose and explode above 200 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. An explosion at the Arlington plant in 1944 killed two workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

To dissipate heat and prevent explosions, the reaction needed to happen in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. However, TFE gas does not dissolve in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. DuPont needed a way to disperse TFE evenly throughout the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

In 1951, DuPont purchased a special acid called PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid), also known as C8, from 3M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. C8, similar in structure to Teflon with a chain of eight carbon atoms covered in fluorines, also possessed a unique property: an acid head group that loved water (hydrophilic) and a hydrophobic tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. When added to water, C8 molecules formed tiny, dry bubbles, similar to soap, allowing the hydrophobic TFE gas to disperse evenly throughout the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This enabled the polymerization reaction to occur safely, with heat evenly dissipated, preventing explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

This method also allowed Teflon to be suspended in a solution, enabling it to be sprayed onto surfaces as a coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. To make Teflon stick, surfaces were sandblasted to create microscopic grooves; heating the sprayed Teflon coating would soften it, mechanically adhering it to the rough surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## Teflon's Commercial Success and Growing Concerns

After the war, secrecy bans on Teflon patents were lifted, allowing DuPont to sell it commercially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. In 1954, a French engineer, Marc Gregoire, applied Teflon to his fishing gear to prevent tangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. His wife suggested coating a pan instead, leading to the invention of non-stick pans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. These pans sparked a cooking revolution, and DuPont effectively marketed Teflon's non-stick properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

Beyond cookware, Teflon and related chemicals like C8 found their way into a vast array of products: stain-resistant carpets and sprays (like 3M's Scotchgard), waterproof and breathable jackets (Gore-Tex), medical implants, coatings for structures like the Statue of Liberty, and even bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The term "Teflon Don" was coined for mobster John Gotti because charges against him "wouldn't stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. By the late 1990s, Teflon generated nearly a billion dollars in yearly sales for DuPont <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## The Exposure and Coverup Unveiled

In 1998, West Virginia farmer Earl Tennant approached lawyer Rob Bilott, suspecting that something in a creek was poisoning his cows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The animals were suffering from tumors, black teeth, and hair loss on their hooves, with white foam discharging from a pipe on a nearby landfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. The pipe was marked with E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, draining from DuPont's massive Washington Works factory complex in Parkersburg, West Virginia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

Initially, Bilott expected permits to reveal the chemical, but nothing on record explained the white foam or the cows' illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. While Teflon (PTFE) itself is considered safe for ingestion and passes through the body, heating it above 350 degrees Celsius can release fumes causing "polymer fume fever" in humans and being highly toxic to birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. However, this didn't explain the cows' poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

Bilott requested all Washington Works operational records, and DuPont sent over 60,000 documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Sifting through them, he repeatedly found references to C8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Early Knowledge of C8 Toxicity

Internal DuPont documents revealed a concerning history:
*   **1961:** DuPont scientists tested C8 on rats, finding that as little as 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight caused abnormal liver growth, and 570 milligrams per kilogram was lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. This study recommended extreme caution and avoiding skin contact with C8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
*   **1962:** DuPont confirmed that high doses of C8 killed rats by injuring the stomach, intestine, brain, lungs, and pancreas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   **1965:** Similar toxic effects were found in dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **1970s:** Studies on monkeys showed C8 causing toxic effects in multiple organ systems, with some monkeys dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

These studies were not shared with the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

### Discovery in Human Blood

In 1975, researchers studying inorganic fluoride in human blood discovered another type of fluorine: organic fluorine (carbon-fluorine bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. This was not naturally occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. They approached 3M, who initially pled ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. However, just three months later, 3M confirmed their chemicals, including PFOA, were in the blood of people across the US, but they did not inform the researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

Both 3M and DuPont checked their own workers' blood and found C8 levels 1,000 times higher than those in the general population study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. Many of these workers showed signs of liver disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Meanwhile, DuPont was dumping almost 10 tons of C8 into the Ohio River annually and piling thousands of tons as C8 sludge at the landfill next to Earl Tennant's farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

By the early 1980s, a cancer study in rats confirmed that PFOA caused testicular tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. DuPont's internal samples confirmed C8 was in the Ohio River and the public water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. In 1984, DuPont considered swapping C8 for a safer chemical but concluded that no economically attractive alternatives existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. They then set their own "safe" drinking water limit for C8 at one part per billion, a level that was then barely detectable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. The landfill wastewater leaching into Earl's creek was found to contain 1,600 parts per billion, a fact DuPont withheld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

## Legal Battles and Health Confirmations

Rob Bilott compiled the evidence into a 900-page letter for the EPA and Department of Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. Months later, DuPont settled with Earl Tennant for an undisclosed sum, denying wrongdoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Bilott then filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of 70,000 people around Parkersburg who were exposed to C8 through their public wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

A 2000 study revealed that 100% of blood samples from thousands of Americans across the country tested positive for C8, with an average of five parts per billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. To determine the harm, a medical study was spearheaded in 2005 for everyone around Washington Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. After seven years of analysis, an independent science panel in 2013 confirmed a probable link between C8 and six human diseases, including [[health_risks_associated_with_pfas_exposure | thyroid disease]], [[health_risks_associated_with_pfas_exposure | testicular cancer]], and [[health_risks_associated_with_pfas_exposure | kidney cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. For example, a person with over 30 parts per billion of C8 in their blood might have about double the odds of developing kidney cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

## The Rise of GenX and Other PFAS

Under pressure from regulators, DuPont phased out C8 by 2013 and paid over $600 million to victims of C8 exposure by 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. DuPont then spun off its Teflon business into Chemours, which began using a new chemical called GenX (C6), a shorter version of C8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Chemours initially claimed that 70 parts per billion of GenX in drinking water would be safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

However, GenX also caused the exact same three tumors in rats (liver, testicular, and pancreatic) as PFOA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. Its shorter chain also makes GenX more mobile, potentially contaminating larger areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. This highlights the "Whac-A-Mole" problem: as one [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]] chemical is addressed, a new, similar one emerges, requiring new research and regulatory efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

## [[Environmental impact of PFAS chemicals | PFAS]]: Forever Chemicals

[[Environmental impact of PFAS chemicals | PFAS]] (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a family of over 14,000 different manmade chemicals, all characterized by carbon-fluorine bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. Like Teflon, they possess "magical qualities," repelling liquids and grease, making them useful in a wide range of products, including waterproof clothing, fast food wrappers, microwave popcorn bags, cosmetics, and anti-smudge coatings on screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.

The same carbon-fluorine bonds that make [[Environmental impact of PFAS chemicals | PFAS]] so useful also make them incredibly persistent in the environment, earning them the name "forever chemicals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. They have been found globally, from bustling cities to untouched wilderness, including Antarctica, and in almost every living creature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Despite companies knowing about the dangers for 50 years, this global contamination is only now being fully realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

### [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | Health Risks]] and Exposure Sources

Not all [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS]] are equally dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. Long-chain fluoropolymers like Teflon are too large and inert to be absorbed by the body, so they are generally safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. However, the processing aids used to make them, such as PFOA or GenX, are smaller (5-10 carbons long) and can enter the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. These "perfluoroalkyl acids" can bind to blood proteins and accumulate in the body over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.

A 2022 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on seven perfluoroalkyl acids (including PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS) suggested that levels below two parts per billion in blood are likely harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. Levels between 2 and 20 parts per billion indicate potential for harm, while above 20 parts per billion, the risk is even greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>. [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS exposure]] has been consistently linked to high cholesterol, decreased immune response to vaccines, kidney cancer, and decreased growth in infants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

The three main ways people are exposed to [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS]] are:
1.  **Products:** While direct skin exposure from [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]]-containing products (like non-stick pans or waterproof clothing) is likely low, the chemicals can easily end up in the environment during manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.
2.  **Food:** [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]] can leach from treated food packaging (e.g., takeout boxes, microwave popcorn bags, burger wrappers) into food, especially when heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. A 2019 study found that eating fast food and microwave popcorn specifically can increase [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS]] load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.
3.  **Water:** Water is the biggest source of exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. Areas near [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]] factories, military bases, or airports are often heavily contaminated because firefighting foams, which contain [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]] to reduce surface tension and block oxygen, seep into soil and groundwater during drills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. The entire water cycle is now contaminated, with rain containing unsafe levels of at least four [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]] species, even in remote areas like the Tibetan Plateau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

### Regulation and [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | Alternatives]]

In April 2024, the US EPA finally set legal limits for [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]] in drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. The safe level for PFOA was reduced from DuPont's initial one part per billion to four parts per trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. Similar limits were set for PFOS and GenX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. For context, the EPA's limit for lead in water is 10,000 parts per trillion, and for cyanide, 200,000 parts per trillion, indicating the scientific community's high concern for [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

Individuals concerned about water contamination can use [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]]-certified filters, such as reverse osmosis, granulated active carbon, or ion exchange filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. However, the responsibility for filtering water should ideally fall on manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. Companies like Puraffinity are developing custom filters to capture [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]] at the source during manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

### Personal Risk and Outlook

While everyone's [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS risk]] differs based on lifestyle and water contamination, prioritizing healthy habits like not smoking, exercising, and maintaining a healthy diet and sleep remain the top hierarchy of risk reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS exposure]] currently falls into a lower tier of intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>.

There are currently no approved medical treatments for [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS]] exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. Interestingly, male [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS]] levels are consistently higher until around age 50, partly because menstruation, birth, and lactation allow [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS]] to exit the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. Pregnant individuals and young children are particularly susceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Firefighters have notably high [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS]] levels due to their gear and foams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>; a 2022 study found that frequent blood or plasma donation could reduce their [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS]] levels by up to 30% within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.

While a complete ban on [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]] is not yet feasible due to their critical role in medical implants and semiconductor manufacturing, there is growing momentum to ban them in hygiene products, cosmetics, and food packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. The ongoing efforts by scientists to develop destruction mechanisms, novel capture materials, and replacements for [[alternatives_and_regulations_for_pfas | PFAS]] offer hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.

The history of [[thomas_midgley_jr_and_the_invention_of_tetraethyl_lead | leaded gasoline]], Freon, and asbestos shows that with research and public awareness, dangerous chemicals can be phased out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. As consumers become more aware of [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | PFAS]], their demand is driving companies to remove these chemicals from products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.

Terminal velocity is the constant speed that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium through which it is falling prevents further acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This occurs when the force of gravity pulling an object down is equal to the force of [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | air resistance]] pushing it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Every object has its own terminal velocity, which is the maximum speed it will reach in free fall through still air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Factors Affecting Terminal Velocity

The terminal velocity of an object is influenced by several factors:

*   **Weight**: Heavier objects generally have higher terminal velocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Air Resistance**: The force of [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | air resistance]] is proportional to the object's speed squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> and directly proportional to the density of the air it is moving through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Cross-sectional Area**: A larger cross-sectional area leads to greater drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Shape/Drag Coefficient**: The overall shape of an object determines how smoothly air flows around it, which is captured by a dimensionless number called the Drag Coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. A lower drag coefficient indicates less resistance.

## Objects and Their Terminal Velocities

### Hammer vs. Feather

The classic experiment of dropping a hammer and a feather illustrates the significant role of [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | air resistance]]:

*   **On the Moon**: In the near vacuum of the Moon's surface, both objects accelerate at the same rate due to the Moon's [[differences_in_gravity_between_earth_moon_and_mars | gravity]] and hit the ground at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **On Earth**: On Earth, the hammer lands much earlier than the feather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The feather quickly reaches its terminal velocity and moves at a constant speed, while the hammer continues to accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Despite its faster speed, the hammer experiences a greater force of [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | air resistance]] than the feather, but its much greater weight makes this drag negligible in comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Pennies

The common myth about a penny dropped from the Empire State Building being deadly is incorrect due to [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | air resistance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

*   A penny weighs approximately 2.5 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   Without [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | air resistance]], a penny dropped from the Empire State Building's 443-meter height would reach over 300 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   However, pennies reach their terminal velocity after falling only about 15 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   Their maximum terminal velocity is around 80 kilometers per hour (50 miles per hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   At this speed, a falling penny delivers only about 0.2 Joules of kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   Pennies also flutter and tumble as they fall, exhibiting two different terminal velocities as they oscillate between falling on their face and on their edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   Dropping pennies from a helicopter showed they would sting but not be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### People and Objects in a Wind Tunnel

Experiments in a vertical wind tunnel demonstrate how different objects behave based on their weight-to-drag ratio:

*   **Identical Balls with Different Weights**: Two balls of the same size and shape, but one heavier due to added water, experience the same [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | air resistance]]. The heavier ball has a higher terminal velocity and requires a higher wind speed to float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Person vs. Lacrosse Ball**: Despite vastly different sizes, shapes, and weights, a person and a lacrosse ball can have the same terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This is because the ratio of their weight to [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | air resistance]] is the same, allowing them to float together in the tunnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Felix Baumgartner (Stratosphere Jump)

Felix Baumgartner's 2012 jump from 39 kilometers above sea level showcased the effect of air density on terminal velocity:

*   In the thin air of the stratosphere, Baumgartner reached a terminal velocity over 1300 kilometers per hour (over 800 miles per hour) after just 40 seconds of free fall, becoming the first person to break the sound barrier without a vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   The air at that altitude is 60 times less dense than at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   As he fell into thicker atmosphere, his terminal velocity decreased, slowing to 200 kilometers per hour by 2.5 kilometers above sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Raindrops vs. Hailstones

The terminal velocities of raindrops and hailstones differ significantly:

*   **Raindrops**: Through the thicker air of the troposphere, raindrops (0.5 to 4 mm in diameter) have a low terminal velocity of just 25 kilometers per hour (15.5 miles per hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. They are generally spherical but flatter on the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. If too large, they break into smaller droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. A raindrop delivers about 0.002 Joules of kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Hailstones**: Hail can reach terminal velocities of over 200 kilometers per hour (124 miles per hour), about 10 times that of rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. While ice is slightly less dense than liquid water, hail can grow much larger, up to 20 centimeters in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Since drag scales with radius squared and weight scales with radius cubed, larger hailstones have higher terminal velocities and carry more kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. A large hailstone can deliver over 80 Joules of kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

### Ballpoint Pens

Similar to pennies, the myth of falling ballpoint pens being lethal from a skyscraper is largely unfounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

*   Plastic pens weigh about twice as much as a penny and have a smaller cross-sectional area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   However, they still have too much drag relative to their weight to achieve a high terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   [[testing_and_experiments_with_kinetic_projectiles | Tests]] with ballistics gel dummies showed they did not penetrate or cause significant damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Bullets

Bullets are designed for low drag, but their behavior in free fall is counter-intuitive:

*   Modern bullet shapes have a drag coefficient between 0.1 and 0.3, significantly lower than a sphere's 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   If dropped from a skyscraper, a bullet would tumble and likely fall on its side, experiencing far more [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | air resistance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   A bullet fired straight up will slow down, stop at its peak (up to 3 km high), and then fall back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. It tumbles on the way down and is much slower than its launch speed upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   If a bullet is not fired completely vertically, it maintains horizontal velocity and spin from the gun barrel, keeping it pointed forwards. This allows it to speed up to a significant fraction of its launch speed, making celebratory gunfire dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

### Fléchettes and Lazy Dogs

These were military kinetic projectiles designed to be dropped from aircraft:

*   **Fléchettes**: Small metal darts, up to 15 cm long, with feathers to ensure straight fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. They were cheap, didn't require explosives, and could pierce helmets, causing nasty injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Some were reported to pass through a rider and his horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Lazy Dogs**: Similar but heftier weapons used in the Korean and Vietnam wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. While their kinetic energy might not be enough to fracture a skull, their ability to apply a large force to a small area made them dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

## Lethality of Falling Objects

The energy required to fracture a human skull is around 68 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

*   **Raindrop**: 0.002 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Penny**: 0.2 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Baseball / Large Hailstone**: More than 80 Joules, enough to crack a skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Measuring Tape**: In 2014, a man was killed by a falling measuring tape from 50 stories up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

Objects that weigh a few grams and are not aerodynamic, like pennies and plastic pens, are not fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. However, objects weighing more than a few hundred grams traveling at their terminal velocity are likely to be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Falling objects cause nearly 700 American deaths annually, ranging from loose tiles and bricks to construction tools, rocks, branches, and icicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

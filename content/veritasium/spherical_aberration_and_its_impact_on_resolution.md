Spherical aberration is a fundamental flaw that distorts images in many optical systems, including electron microscopes. It became a significant hurdle in achieving high-resolution images, particularly in electron microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Understanding Spherical Aberration

Spherical aberration occurs because lenses, whether made of glass or electromagnetic fields, do not deflect light or electron beams perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:01">[06:01:01]</a>. In an ideal scenario, all rays passing through a lens would converge at a single focal point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. However, in reality, the magnetic field in an electromagnetic lens is much stronger near its edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This causes rays further from the optical axis to be over-deflected, focusing before the rays in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. As a result, the focus is spread across the optical axis instead of being contained in a single point, leading to a blurred image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. This blur worsens with higher magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

Spherical aberration affects every radially symmetric magnetic lens, as well as all spherical lenses found in cameras, telescopes, and magnifying glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## The Challenge in Electron Microscopy

Early electron microscopes, like the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) developed by Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll, faced this inherent limitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. German physicist Otto Scherzer published a paper in 1936 stating that this flaw in electromagnetic lenses was unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

While traditional optical lens systems can minimize spherical aberration by adding a second diverging lens to cancel out effects, this is physically impossible with electromagnetic lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. All magnetic field lines must form closed loops, starting and ending at the same pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. This means electrons always cross through two field lines, which by the Lorentz force, will always converge the beam and never diverge it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Scherzer's proof confirmed that it was impossible to produce a radially symmetric magnetic lens that diverges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. This roadblock significantly slowed advancements in the microscope's resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

Even Albert Crewe, who made significant improvements to the scanning TEM (STEM) by using a directed electron source from a sharpened tungsten tip and scanning the sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>, eventually gave up on trying to overcome spherical aberration after a decade of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

## The Breakthrough in Aberration Correction

The solution came from breaking the radial symmetry of the lens, an approach that Scherzer's theorem did not forbid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. Knut Urban, Max Haider, and Harold Rose, often seen as "troublemakers" in the electron microscope community, proposed a radical idea: purposely distorting the image with non-symmetric lenses, hoping a small part of this distorted image would be slightly diverging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

Their method involved using a "nest" of electromagnets with six, eight, or even ten separate coils, creating bumpy magnetic fields, known as hexapole, octopole, and decapole magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. When an electron beam passed through a hexapole, it would twist and squeeze the 2D image into a triangular saddle shape, creating a slight concave bow in the middle of the image, which acted as a small divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. By passing the beam through a second, opposite hexapole to unbend the image, they calculated that the new image would retain remnants of that tiny divergence, with spherical aberration pointing in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. This complex engineering and mathematical precision allowed them to almost completely counteract the effect of spherical aberration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.

In July 1997, after years of failed attempts and just days before their funding ran out, their new lens design worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. The picture stabilized, revealing beautiful, clear images of atoms without aberration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. This method cut the resolution of the TEM down to an impressive 0.13 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. Ondrej Krivanek independently achieved the same for the scanning TEM (STEM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. For their persistence and ingenuity, Urban, Rose, Haider, and Krivanek were awarded the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>.

## Impact on Resolution and Material Science

The development of [[role_of_aberrationcorrected_microscopes_in_material_science | aberration-corrected microscopes]] was a "game changer" for scientific research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>. With aberration correction, it became possible to clearly see individual atoms and measure atomic distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. This capability is crucial for any research in fields like material science, materials engineering, and chemical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. To understand the properties of materials, it is essential to see their structure at the atomic level; without it, researchers would only have half the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>.

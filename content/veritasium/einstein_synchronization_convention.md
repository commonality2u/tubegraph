The speed of light, officially defined since 1983, is exactly 299,792,458 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This value is used to define the length of a meter, making the speed of light a fixed number without decimals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, this accepted value refers to the "round-trip" or "two-way" speed of light, not the "one-way" speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The fundamental challenge lies in the fact that no one has ever truly measured the one-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The Problem of Measuring One-Way Speed

Measuring the speed of an object typically involves knowing the distance it travels between two points and the time it takes to cover that distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Applying this to light presents a unique challenge:

1.  **Two Clocks & Synchronization**: To measure the time it takes for a light beam to travel from a starting point to an end point, one would need two clocks—one at the start and one at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The crucial difficulty then becomes how to synchronize these two clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   **Connecting via wire**: Sending a pulse through a wire to synchronize them won't work, as that pulse itself travels at the speed of light, introducing an unknown time delay equal to the very value one is trying to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   **Moving clocks**: Synchronizing clocks at the same location and then moving one to the end point also fails. [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Special relativity]] predicts that moving clocks tick slower relative to stationary observers, causing them to fall out of sync by the time they reach their destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Even moving them very slowly doesn't solve the issue if the one-way speed of light itself affects time dilation in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
2.  **Round Trip as the Only Solution**: The only current solution to measure light's speed is to use a single clock and a mirror to reflect the light back to the starting point, timing the full round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This method was successfully employed by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849, who measured the speed of light using a spinning gear and a distant mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. His measurement of 313,000 kilometers per second was within 5% of the accepted value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
3.  **Modern Attempts**: Even with high-speed cameras or fiber optic cables, the measurement fundamentally remains a round trip, averaging out any potential one-way speed differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Attempts to claim a one-way speed measurement have been debunked, as they still implicitly measure the two-way speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Einstein Synchronization Convention

The inability to experimentally verify the one-way speed of light means that the assumption that light travels at the same speed in all directions is a *convention*, not an empirically proven fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

[[einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein]] himself highlighted this in his renowned 1905 paper, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. He noted that there's no way to meaningfully compare times measured by clocks at different locations (A and B) unless it's defined that the time for light to travel from A to B equals the time to travel from B to A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This is explicitly stated as "by definition," signifying it as a stipulation or convention rather than a physical hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This is known as the **Einstein synchronization convention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Implications for Simultaneity

This convention implies that the concept of "simultaneity" (things happening at the same time at different locations) is defined by this assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Consider the example of an astronaut on Mars ("Mark") trying to synchronize his clock with Earth:
*   **Assuming equal speeds**: If the signal takes 10 minutes to reach Mars and 10 minutes to return (based on a 20-minute round trip), Mark sets his clock to 12:10 PM if the signal was sent at 12:00 PM Earth time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This works perfectly under the Einstein convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Hypothetical unequal speeds**: However, if the speed of light from Earth to Mars was `c/2` (taking 20 minutes) and instantaneous from Mars back to Earth, and no one knew this, they would still apply the Einstein convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The message would still take 20 minutes to reach Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Mark would still *assume* it took 10 minutes and set his clock to 12:10 PM, even though it's 12:20 PM on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. His reply would be instantaneously received on Earth at 12:20 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
    *   The experience for both communicators would be identical, with the same messages and local time delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    *   Crucially, their clocks would be out of sync by 10 minutes, and they would have no way to detect or correct this error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This scenario demonstrates how the definition of simultaneity is flexible and dependent on the chosen convention for the one-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. GPS systems, for instance, are based on the assumption that light speed is the same in all directions; if it were not, their synchronization would still result in measurements of 'c' for the one-way speed of light, regardless of its true value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Why This Matters

This "unknowable" aspect of the universe—that we cannot empirically determine the one-way speed of light and thus define absolute simultaneity across distances—has been debated since 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

While many physicists simply accept the convention of equal speeds in all directions (often appealing to Occam's razor for simplicity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, it remains a fascinating and fundamental point:
*   The round-trip speed of light is a constant 'c' for all inertial observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   However, the one-way speed of light might not have a well-defined value that can be measured independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   This could imply a hidden aspect of the universe, potentially hinting at deeper connections between [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | General Relativity]], Quantum Mechanics, space, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

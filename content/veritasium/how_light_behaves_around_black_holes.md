On Wednesday, April 10th, 2019, the [[Firstever image of a black hole | first-ever image of a black hole]] was expected to be released by the [[First image of a black hole by Event Horizon Telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This image was anticipated to resemble a fuzzy coffee mug stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The significance of this [[first image of a black hole by Event Horizon Telescope | image]] lies in its potential to confirm whether the general theory of relativity accurately predicts phenomena in the strong gravity regime around a [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Black Hole Fundamentals

At the heart of a [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] is the [[black holes and event horizons | event horizon]], a spherical boundary from which neither [[Nature of light | light]] nor any other particle can escape detection by an outside observer if fired radially away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Once inside, all world lines lead to the singularity at the center, meaning there is no return, even for [[Nature of light | light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The radius of the [[black holes and event horizons | event horizon]] is known as the Schwarzschild radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

A [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] itself cannot be directly imaged because it absorbs all [[use of electromagnetic waves to view black holes | electromagnetic radiation]] that falls onto it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. However, the [[black hole]] targeted by the [[First image of a black hole by Event Horizon Telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]], Sagittarius A* at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, is surrounded by an [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] of matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The Accretion Disk

The [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] consists of incredibly hot dust and gas, reaching millions of degrees, swirling chaotically and moving at a significant fraction of the speed of [[Nature of light | light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This matter fuels the [[black hole]], causing it to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] does not extend all the way to the [[black holes and event horizons | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This is due to the existence of an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For a non-spinning [[black hole]], this orbit is located at three Schwarzschild radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If matter falls inside this orbit, it quickly spirals into the [[black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## The Photon Sphere

Unlike matter, [[Nature of light | light]], having no mass, can orbit closer to a [[black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. It can orbit at 1.5 Schwarzschild radii, forming what is known as the photon sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is a sphere of photon orbits, and theoretically, if one could be there, they could look forward and see the back of their own head as photons complete the orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. However, the photon sphere is an unstable orbit, meaning photons will eventually either spiral into the singularity or spiral out to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Warping Space-Time and the Black Hole "Shadow"

The [[black hole]] significantly warps space-time around it, causing [[Nature of light | light rays]] to travel in curved paths rather than straight lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

*   [[Nature of light | Light rays]] that cross the [[black holes and event horizons | event horizon]] are absorbed and cannot be seen, creating a dark region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   Even [[Nature of light | light rays]] passing just above the [[black holes and event horizons | event horizon]] or at the distance of the photon sphere can be bent and eventually fall into the [[black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   For a parallel [[Nature of light | light ray]] to avoid falling into the [[black hole]], it must originate from at least 2.6 Schwarzschild radii away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. These rays will graze the photon sphere at their closest approach and then escape to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The resulting "shadow" observed in an [[first image of a black hole by event horizon telescope | image]] is approximately 2.6 times larger than the [[black holes and event horizons | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. While the [[black holes and event horizons | event horizon]] maps cleanly to the center of this shadow, [[Nature of light | light rays]] going above or below can also cross the [[black holes and event horizons | event horizon]] on the backside, effectively mapping the entire backside of the [[black holes and event horizons | event horizon]] onto a ring within the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This means observers can effectively "see" the entirety of the [[black holes and event horizons | black hole's event horizon]], even though it's completely dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Furthermore, [[Nature of light | light]] can orbit the [[black hole]] multiple times, creating infinite images of the [[black holes and event horizons | event horizon]] as annular rings that approach the edge of the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The first visible [[Nature of light | light]] comes from rays that graze the photon sphere and then travel to our telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Viewing Angles and Relativistic Effects

The appearance of the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] and [[black hole]] shadow changes depending on the viewing angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. If viewed perpendicular to the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]], the shadow is circular. However, if viewed edge-on, the warping of space-time by the [[black hole]] causes [[Nature of light | light rays]] from the back of the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] to bend over and under the [[black hole]] and reach our telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This creates a distorted image where parts of the back of the disk are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Even more complex interactions occur:
*   [[Nature of light | Light]] from the top of the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] can travel around the back of the [[black hole]], graze the photon sphere, and appear as a thin ring underneath the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   Similarly, [[Nature of light | light]] from the bottom of the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] can go underneath and around the back of the [[black hole]], appearing over the top, forming another ring of [[Nature of light | light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

A crucial factor influencing the image is [[relativistic beaming and plasma orbiting black holes | relativistic beaming]] (or Doppler beaming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Because the matter in the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] moves at a significant fraction of the speed of [[Nature of light | light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, matter moving towards the observer will appear much brighter than matter moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This effect will create a bright spot in the observed [[first image of a black hole by event horizon telescope | image]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Future observations of the [[first image of a black hole by event horizon telescope | black hole image]] over time could reveal moving "blobs" within the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]], providing further insights into the dynamics of [[Nature of light | light]] and matter around [[black holes and event horizons | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Inside every human cell, there are six feet of DNA, composed of six billion letters of genetic code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This DNA is divided into 46 pieces, each 3 to 4 cm long, known as [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While chromosomes are often depicted in their condensed form, they only appear this way when a cell is preparing to divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Normally, DNA exists as a wiggly thread within the cell's nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Considering DNA is only about 2 nanometers wide but a chromosome can be centimeters long, tangling would be a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. To prevent this, DNA is intricately wrapped around proteins called [[Role of Histones in DNA Packing | histones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These histones possess "wiggly tails" that play a crucial role in gene regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Sex Chromosomes and X-Inactivation

A person's unique set of DNA is formed when 23 chromosomes from their mother combine with 23 from their father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. While 22 pairs of chromosomes from each parent form matching sets, the 23rd set comprises the sex chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Two X chromosomes result in a female, while an X and a Y chromosome result in a male <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

In males, both sex chromosomes can remain active throughout life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, for females, one of the X chromosomes must be inactivated for proper development to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This process, known as [[X Chromosome Inactivation in Females | X Chromosome Inactivation]], happens when a female embryo is merely four days old and consists of only 100 cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### The Process of X-Inactivation

Initially, both the X chromosome from the father and the one from the mother are active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Through a "tiny molecular battle," one X chromosome "wins" and remains active, while the other is inactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The inactivation mechanism involves several steps:
*   **DNA Packing**: The DNA is packed more closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Histone Modifications**: Modifications are made to the "dangly histone tails," signaling inactivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Structural Proteins**: New structural proteins are added to bind everything closer together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Methyl Groups**: Tiny molecular markers called methyl groups are added to the DNA, effectively signaling to the cell that this DNA should not be read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

All these combined actions make the DNA very difficult for the molecular machinery to access and harness its code, effectively switching off or silencing the DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Active X Chromosome

In contrast, the active X chromosome's DNA is more spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This allows for better access to the genes on the chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Histones can be slid along the DNA or removed entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Histone tails have different modifications, signaling that this DNA is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

This accessibility allows RNA polymerase to access and transcribe the DNA into messenger RNA, which then moves into the cell to be used for protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Randomness and Perpetuation

A surprising aspect of X-chromosome inactivation is its seeming randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. In some cells, the father's X chromosome becomes active, while in others, the mother's X chromosome becomes active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This results in the 100-cell embryo having a mixture of active X chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Crucially, as these cells divide, they maintain the active X chromosome they initially possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This means that all cells originating from a cell with an active paternal X chromosome will continue to have an active paternal X chromosome into adulthood, and similarly for the maternal X chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

> If one could observe a woman's skin, a stripy pattern would be visible, reflecting the growth and migration of these initial 100 cells from the four-day-old embryo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## [[calico_cats_as_an_example_of_epigenetics | Calico Cats]] as an Example

This phenomenon is clearly visible in [[calico_cats_as_an_example_of_epigenetics | Calico cats]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The gene responsible for coat color in cats is located on the X chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. By observing the pattern of a Calico cat's dark and light spots, one can see where the mother's or father's X chromosome has been inactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This also explains why only female cats can be Calico, as only females inherit two X chromosomes with two potentially different color genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Broader Implications of Epigenetics

[[X Chromosome Inactivation in Females | X chromosome inactivation]] is just one example of epigenetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Epigenetics, in a broader sense, is at play across all chromosomes, constantly turning genes on and off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. For instance, it is epigenetics that enables a pancreatic cell to produce insulin, as the insulin gene is switched on in these cells but switched off elsewhere in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Influence of Behavior
> Interestingly, an individual's behaviors can affect their epigenetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Even more remarkably, the actions of one's parents or grandparents may also influence their epigenetics, which can impact their DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Therefore, a person is not solely a product of their genetic code or DNA, but also a product of their epigenetics, which is influenced by both their own behavior and the behavior of their ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

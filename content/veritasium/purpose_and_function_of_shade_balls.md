[[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | Shade balls]] are small, black, high-density polyethylene spheres deployed in large numbers on water reservoirs, most notably in Los Angeles, California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While often mistakenly believed to primarily reduce evaporation, their main purpose is to maintain water quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Problem: Bromate Formation

The deployment of [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] in the Los Angeles Reservoir addresses a specific water quality issue related to Bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Bromide and Disinfection
Bromide is a naturally occurring substance found in water sources, often associated with salt water intrusions, such as those in the California Aqueduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. While harmless on its own and difficult to remove, Bromide can become Bromate when the water is disinfected with Ozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Bromate is a known carcinogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, and regulations were established around 2000 to control its formation in treatment plants using Ozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Unforeseen Chemical Reaction
Initially, Bromate levels were measured only at filtration plants and were within the 10 micrograms per liter limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. However, a beverage company customer in Los Angeles reported high levels of Bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Investigations revealed that upon entering the open reservoir, Bromate levels jumped significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

The crucial discovery was that Bromide, when combined with Chlorine (used for water disinfection), formed Bromate in bright sunlight, even more effectively than Ozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Since Bromide and Chlorine are necessary, the only viable solution was to remove sunlight from the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Solution Exploration and The Emergence of Shade Balls

Various options were considered to block sunlight:
*   **Floating tarps**: A multi-year project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Poly-like PVC pipe trampolines**: Feared to become bird perches and lead to water quality problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **High-density polyethylene pipe**: While it floats, using it as a solid pile was hard and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Chipped pipe debris field**: Would create warm, mushy water, potentially turning the reservoir into a "Petri dish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Dr. Bryan White's research led to the discovery of the "shade ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Origin as "Bird Balls"
Before their use in water quality, these balls were known as "bird balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Their original purpose was to deter waterfowl from landing on ponds containing mine tailings (to prevent poisoning) or near airports (to prevent bird strikes with jet engines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Wind tunnel testing had already been conducted on them to assess their behavior in strong winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Testing and Deployment
To test their effectiveness against Bromate, three kiddie pools were filled with reservoir water: one exposed to sunlight, one covered with a tarp, and one covered with [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] immediately solved the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Design and Material
[[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | Shade balls]] are black to effectively block all light from reaching the water, thus preventing the Bromate reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. They are made of high-density polyethylene, the same food-grade plastic used for milk jugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This material is stable and safe for drinking water contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The black color is due to "carbon black," a pigment that makes the plastic last for at least 10 years when exposed to sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Other colors tested with dyes were not stable enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The balls are inert and do not bleach material or get hot enough to affect water quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. They are partially filled with water to prevent high winds from blowing them away, causing them to wobble if they roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The spherical shape is crucial because it allows them to spread out and cover the water completely as the reservoir's water level fluctuates, unlike hexagonal designs which might stack or perch on the banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Additional Benefits and Characteristics

Beyond preventing Bromate formation, [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] offer several other advantages:

### Algae Control
Blocking sunlight eliminates algae growth in the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This has significantly reduced the need for chlorine disinfection, which was previously used heavily to control algae and could sometimes cause a green tinge in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Evaporation Reduction
Despite being black, [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] reduce evaporation by 80 to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Reduced Surface Area**: They cover the water surface, limiting the area where water molecules can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Reduced Airflow**: They prevent dry air from continually replacing the moist air layer above the water, which would otherwise increase evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Insulation**: While the tops of the balls get hot, the bottoms remain cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The air contained within the partially hollow balls acts as an effective thermal insulator, preventing heat transfer to the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Cooling Effect**: Measurements have shown that the water under the [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] is actually cooler than exposed water, demonstrating a slight cooling effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Cost-Effectiveness
Each [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade ball]] costs approximately 33-34 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Over their lifespan, the savings from reduced chlorination and evaporation are estimated to offset at least half the cost of the balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. They also have a salvage value as a recyclable material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Scale and Operational Challenges

The Los Angeles Reservoir is covered by an estimated 96 million [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Navigating a boat through this dense layer is very difficult, akin to driving through "peanut butter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The balls form "close-packed crystal-like structures" that are hard to push aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Despite the challenges, the balls remain stable on the water and do not drift with a breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

The challenges inherent in transmitting electrical signals over long distances became acutely apparent with the advent of early telecommunication cables, particularly undersea telegraph cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## The Transatlantic Cable

The first Transatlantic Cable was laid in 1858 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. However, it only functioned for approximately one month and never operated correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Engineers encountered significant distortions when attempting to send signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, resulting in enormous amounts of distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This limited the cable's operational speed to merely a few words per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

Sending signals over such a long undersea distance caused pulses to become distorted and lengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, making it difficult to differentiate between dots and dashes in Morse code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Scientific Debate on Energy Transmission

To understand and address the cable's failure, a debate emerged among scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

*   **William Thomson (Lord Kelvin's View)**: William Thomson, who would later become Lord Kelvin, believed that electrical signals moved through submarine cables akin to water flowing through a rubber tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Heaviside and Fitzgerald's View**: Other scientists, including Oliver Heaviside and George Francis Fitzgerald, posited that it was the electromagnetic fields *around* the wires, rather than the electrons within, that carried both energy and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This perspective ultimately proved correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### The Role of Poynting's Vector

This understanding is rooted in the work of James Clerk Maxwell, who in the 1860s and 1870s, realized that light is composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. His equations, known as Maxwell's equations, describe the behavior of these fields and waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

In 1883, Maxwell's former student, John Henry Poynting, developed an equation to describe energy flux (the amount of electromagnetic energy passing through an area per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This is known as the Poynting vector (S) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, calculated as a constant (one over mu naught) multiplied by the cross product of the electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields (E x B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

The Poynting vector demonstrates that energy flows perpendicular to both the electric and magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Crucially, Poynting's equation applies whenever electric and magnetic fields coincide, not just for light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

When an electric circuit is activated, the electric field from the battery extends through the circuit at the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This field initiates electron drift, which is very slow (around a tenth of a millimeter per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, and creates surface charges that establish electric fields outside the wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The current inside the wires simultaneously generates a magnetic field outside the wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

The combination of these electric and magnetic fields in the space around the circuit results in a flow of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Using the right-hand rule, it can be determined that energy flows outwards from the battery and along the wires, being directed into the device (e.g., a light bulb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This demonstrates that energy is transmitted by the electric and magnetic fields, not by the electrons themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Even in alternating current (AC) systems, where electrons oscillate back and forth within the wires, the electric and magnetic fields flip simultaneously, ensuring the Poynting vector continues to point the energy flux in one direction: from the source to the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Design Flaws and Lessons Learned

The design of the early submarine cables contributed to their failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The central copper conductor was coated in an insulator and then encased in an iron sheath to protect and strengthen the cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. However, iron is a good conductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, and its presence interfered with the propagation of electromagnetic fields by increasing the capacitance of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

This historical lesson is why modern power lines are suspended high above the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Even damp earth acts as a conductor, necessitating a large insulating gap of air to separate the wires from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The understanding that energy is delivered by traveling electromagnetic waves around power lines is fundamental to their design and operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

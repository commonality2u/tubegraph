The Gordon Dam in Tasmania, which stands 126.5 meters (415 feet) high, was the site of an experiment involving dropped basketballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Friends of the narrator, identified as "How Ridiculous," conducted the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## The Experiment
Initially, a basketball was dropped over the edge without spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This ball was slightly affected by the breeze but landed close to where it was dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

A second basketball was then dropped by Bret, this time given a bit of backspin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The ball dramatically took off horizontally, surprising those observing the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Magnus Effect
The unexpected trajectory of the spinning basketball is explained by the Magnus effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This effect influences all rotating balls or cylinders as they move through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### How it Works
As the basketball gains speed, the air on the side of the ball rotating in the same direction as its spin is dragged along and deflected backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Conversely, on the opposite side, where the air moves against the ball's spin, the airflow separates from the ball instead of being deflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The net result is that the ball pushes air in one direction, and according to Newton's third law, the air exerts an equal and opposite force on the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This generated lift (or sideways force, depending on the spin axis) causes the ball to deviate from a simple parabolic trajectory.

### Historical Context
The Magnus effect is named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus, who provided a description of it in 1852 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, Isaac Newton had described the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College almost two centuries earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Applications of the Magnus Effect
The Magnus effect is crucial in various sports, including tennis, soccer, and golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. It also has [[non_sport_uses_of_magnus_effect | non-sport applications]]:

*   **Flettner Rotors on Ships**: Some ships use spinning cylinders, known as "Flettner rotors," in place of traditional sails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. These rotors utilize the Magnus effect to deflect crosswinds and propel the ship forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. An example is the E-Ship 1, which employs four Flettner rotors to enhance efficiency and reduce fuel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Experimental Aircraft**: The Magnus effect has been explored for aircraft design. An experimental plane was built with spinning cylinders instead of wings, which generated more lift than traditional wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, this design also produced significantly more drag, rendering it impractical; the plane only flew once before crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. More recently, experimental rotor wing aircraft generate all their lift from spinning cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Original Purpose
The primary reason for the friends from "How Ridiculous" being at the Gordon Dam was to attempt setting a world record for the highest basket ever scored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

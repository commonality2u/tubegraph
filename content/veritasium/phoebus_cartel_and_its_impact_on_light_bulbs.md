The **Phoebus Cartel** was a secret agreement between leading light bulb manufacturers in the 1920s to intentionally reduce the lifespan of their products, a practice now widely known as planned obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

## The Longest-Lasting Light Bulb
In Livermore, California, Fire Station number six houses what is considered the longest continuously burning light bulb in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Manufactured by hand in 1901, it has been on for 120 years, running for over a million hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This longevity is significantly longer than any modern light bulb is designed to last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Its remarkable durability sparked a story that an "everlasting light bulb" was invented years ago but never sold due to being a "terrible business model," as it would eliminate repeat customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. While this idea initially sounded ridiculous (as an everlasting product could command higher prices), it turns out that light bulbs were indeed intentionally made worse in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## The Incandescent Light Bulb
Inventing a viable electric light was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. The typical incandescent design involves passing electric current through a material until it glows from heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Less than 5% of the electrical energy is converted into light, with the remaining 95% released as heat, essentially making them "heat bulbs" that produce light as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

The filament's temperature can reach up to 2,800 Kelvin, half as hot as the surface of the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. At such high temperatures, most materials melt or burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. To address this, Warren De la Rue proposed putting the filament in a vacuum bulb in the 1840s to prevent it from reacting with oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

By 1879, [[Thomas Edison Jr and the invention of tetraethyl lead|Thomas Edison]] developed a bulb with a cotton thread filament that lasted 14 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Other inventors used platinum or carbonized materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The lifespan of bulbs gradually increased, with filaments evolving from carbon to tungsten, which has a very high melting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. By the early 1920s, average bulb lifetimes approached 2,000 hours, with some reaching 2,500 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Formation of the Phoebus Cartel
This trend of increasing bulb longevity reversed in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Just before Christmas in 1924, a secret meeting took place in Geneva, Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Top executives from the world's leading light bulb companies, including Phillips, International General Electric, Tokyo Electric, OSRAM (Germany), and the UK's Associated Electric, formed what became known as the Phoebus Cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. The cartel was named after Phoebus, the Greek God of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

These companies agreed to work together to control the global supply of light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. While the early electrical industry had many small manufacturers, they had largely consolidated into these large corporations, each dominant in a specific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## Motivation for the Cartel: Limiting Longevity
The greatest threat faced by these companies was the increasing lifespan of light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. For example, OSRAM sold 63 million light bulbs in 1923, but only 28 million the following year, as bulbs were lasting too long and hurting sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

To combat this, all cartel members agreed to reduce the lifespan of their bulbs to 1,000 hours, almost halving the existing average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### Enforcement and Impact
To ensure compliance, manufacturers had to send sample bulbs from their factories for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. If a bulb lasted significantly longer than 1,000 hours (e.g., over 3,000 hours), the company was fined 200 Swiss Francs for every 1,000 bulbs sold, and records confirm these fines were issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

Engineers, previously tasked with extending bulb lifespan, were now directed to find ways to decrease it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. They experimented with different materials, filament shapes, and thinner connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Their efforts were successful: after the cartel's formation, the lifespan of light bulbs steadily decreased, with the average lifespan reaching just 1,205 hours by 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. As planned, sales for cartel members increased by 25% in the four years after 1926, and despite falling component costs, prices remained virtually unchanged, leading to increased profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

### Public Deception
The public was unaware of this conspiracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. The Phoebus Cartel publicly claimed its purpose was to increase the standardization and efficiency of light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. They did establish the widely used screw thread standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. However, all evidence indicates the cartel's true motivation was increased profits and sales, not consumer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

## The Livermore Bulb's Continued Longevity
The Livermore light bulb's exceptional longevity is partly attributed to being manufactured before the cartel era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Additionally, its filament has always been run at low power (four or five watts) as it was intended to be a nightlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Its continuous operation also reduced thermal cycling, minimizing stress from thermal expansion and contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

## Downfall and Legacy
The Phoebus Cartel was initially planned to last until at least 1955 but collapsed in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. It struggled with external competition and non-compliance among some members, with the outbreak of World War II being the final blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

However, the cartel's methods, especially [[Planned obsolescence | planned obsolescence]], survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This tactic of intentionally shortening product lifespans is still used today by many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Apple iPhones:** In 2003, Apple faced a class-action lawsuit over non-replaceable iPod batteries, which they settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Later, in 2017, Apple admitted to throttling the performance of older iPhones after iOS updates, claiming it was to protect batteries and increase longevity, but this also encouraged users to buy new devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Apple has paid hundreds of millions in fines and settlements related to these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **Automobile Industry:** Henry Ford initially aimed for cars to be affordable, durable tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. However, by 1920, with high market saturation and an economic downturn, DuPont (who controlled General Motors) began introducing cars in different colors and, critically, new styles each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. This "dynamic obsolescence" was designed to make existing cars feel outdated annually, encouraging trade-ins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. GM's head of design, Harley Earl, openly stated their job was to "hasten obsolescence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

### Modern Developments in Light Bulbs
Despite the history of planned obsolescence, the light bulb industry has seen significant technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. In the last two decades, bulbs have evolved from [[History of the light bulb | incandescent]] to compact fluorescent, and now to [[History and development of LEDs | LED]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. Modern LEDs use one-tenth of the energy and can last 10 to 50 times longer than their predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. This means consumers are now more likely to sell their house than to replace an LED bulb installed within it, effectively achieving an "everlasting light bulb" through technological progress rather than design limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

The [[firstever image of a black hole | first-ever image of a black hole]], released by the [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] collaboration on April 10th, 2019, showcased the supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] at the center of the galaxy M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Image and Relativistic Beaming

The image displays plasma orbiting the supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A bright region indicates where plasma is moving towards the observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This phenomenon, known as relativistic beaming, causes plasma traveling near the speed of light to appear brighter when approaching and dimmer when moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

From the image, scientists determined that the plasma orbits in a clockwise direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, completing one orbit in approximately two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Viewing M87 with Electromagnetic Waves

The [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] in M87 was observed using [[use_of_electromagnetic_waves_to_view_black_holes | electromagnetic waves]] with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters, specifically radio waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This part of the spectrum was chosen for imaging because it can reveal features close to the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> and can penetrate through the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] and interstellar dust to reach telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## M87 Black Hole Activity and Jets

The supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] in M87 is highly active, continuously consuming large amounts of matter from its glowing hot [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It also possesses narrow, collimated jets, shown in blue in visualizations, extending above and below it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These jets are believed to be generated by incredibly strong magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> and stretch at least 5,000 light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. One of these jets appears to be pointed almost directly towards Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Relativistic beaming is also the reason this approaching jet is visible in Hubble Space Telescope images, while the receding one is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Perspective and [[How light behaves around black holes | Warping of Spacetime]]

Given that one of the jets is pointed almost directly at us, the perspective of observation is thought to be nearly perpendicular to the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | warping of spacetime]] around the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] allows light from parts of the [[accretion_disk_around a_black_hole | accretion disk]] that are behind the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These distant parts are [[gravitational_lensing_and_the_bullet_cluster | lensed]] and appear above and below the shadow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Scale and Size of the M87 Black Hole

Despite the fuzziness of the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, the M87 [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] is indeed supermassive and enormous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Its mass is measured to be 6.5 billion times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The actual size of its shadow is nearly equivalent to the size of our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

However, its immense distance of fifty-three and a half million light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> means its apparent size from our perspective is only about 40 micro arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. To illustrate this tiny angular size: if the entire sky is divided into 180 degrees, a degree into 60 arcminutes, and an arcminute into 60 arcseconds, then 40 micro arcseconds is equivalent to dividing an arcsecond by 100, then by 100 again, and then by 100 once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Technological Achievement

Observing M87's [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] pushed the limits of technological capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Due to the basic law of physics known as the [[diffraction limit]], achieving this resolution theoretically required a telescope the size of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Since a single Earth-sized telescope is impractical, scientists utilized eight telescopes distributed across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. These telescopes simultaneously observed M87, and as the Earth rotated, it helped fill in the data gaps, simulating an Earth-sized telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## [[Comparison of M87 and Sagittarius A | Comparison with Sagittarius A*]]

While M87 was the focus of the [[firstever image of a black hole | first image]], the Event Horizon Telescope also observed [[Sagittarius A*]], the supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] at the center of our Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. An image of [[Sagittarius A*]] has not yet been released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. [[Sagittarius A*]] is much closer, at approximately 26,000 light-years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, but significantly smaller, with a mass of only four million times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. It is also less active, only periodically consuming matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, and would exhibit much more time-variation, with matter orbiting every four to thirty minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This greater variability is likely why it will take longer to release an image of [[Sagittarius A*]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Confirmation of [[Black Holes and Entropy | Black Holes]] and General Relativity

The striking image of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] in M87 definitively confirms the existence of [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This achievement provides spectacular support for the general theory of relativity, published over a hundred years ago, particularly in the strongest gravitational fields and at the limits of our ability to test the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The dedication of the 200 scientists involved in this pursuit of an seemingly impossible goal is remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

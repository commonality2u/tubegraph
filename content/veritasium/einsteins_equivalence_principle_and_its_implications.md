According to the [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | general theory of relativity]], [[General theory of relativity and gravity | gravity]] is not a force, nor are there gravitational fields; instead, [[General theory of relativity and gravity | gravity]] is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This concept stems from Albert Einstein's "happiest thought," which involved imagining a man falling off the roof of a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Equivalence Principle

Einstein's insight from the falling man scenario was that the man would not feel his own weight while falling, experiencing weightlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Any objects he dropped would remain stationary relative to him or move in uniform motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This situation is akin to being in deep space, far from large masses, where a spaceship is at rest or coasting at constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. In deep space, one would feel no weight, and objects would remain stationary or move in a straight line at constant velocity if pushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Such an observer is considered an inertial observer, not accelerating or in a gravitational field, where all laws of physics apply in their reference frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Einstein's "big leap" was to declare these two scenarios — a man falling from a roof and a "Rocket Man" in deep space — as physically equivalent, not just similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This means the man falling from the roof is not in a gravitational field and is not accelerating; he is an inertial observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. While this might seem counterintuitive because the man is near Earth and appears to be accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, the [[Einsteins equivalence principle and its implications | equivalence principle]] emphasizes the observer's experience: if they feel weightless, they are in an inertial frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Gravity as Curved Spacetime

The apparent curved path of objects, without gravitational forces, is explained by curved spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Rocket Man, for instance, despite his rocket's path bending towards a distant planet, feels weightless and continues to perceive himself as moving with constant velocity in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This is because he is moving in a straight line, but through spacetime that is curved around massive objects like planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

The "straightest" paths over curved surfaces are called geodesics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Inertial observers follow these geodesic paths through curved spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. An analogy is airplanes flying the shortest route between cities, which appears curved on Earth's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Similarly, two people walking due North from the equator will eventually meet at the North Pole, giving the illusion of a force, but they are simply following straight paths on a curved surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Astronauts on the space station are weightless, indicating they are inertial observers traveling on a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Earth's curvature of spacetime causes their straight-line path to appear as a helix, which looks like a circular orbit if the time dimension is ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

The common "bent sheet analogy" for curved spacetime is considered misleading because it intuitively relies on gravitational force, which does not exist in [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | general relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The correct understanding is that objects travel on straight-line paths through spacetime, and spacetime is curved around massive objects, making these paths *appear* non-straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The core principle is: "Matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Acceleration and Non-Inertial Frames

If a rocket in deep space accelerates at 9.8 m/s² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, an external observer would see objects stationary while the rocket floor accelerates into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Inside, everything would appear to accelerate downwards, and one would feel a force on their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This situation feels exactly like being at rest on Earth's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

According to [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | general relativity]], being at rest on Earth *is* an accelerating frame of reference, and there is no gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. In this view, there is no weight force; the only force acting on a person standing on Earth is the normal force from the floor pushing upwards, meaning they are accelerating upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. An acceleration is defined as a deviation from a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The floor prevents one from following a straight line path through spacetime, applying an upward force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. In curved spacetime, one needs to accelerate just to stand still, as their position can be constant while still accelerating due to spacetime curvature and velocity through time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Why All Objects Fall at the Same Rate

[[Einsteins general theory of relativity | General relativity]] simplifies the classical mystery of why all objects fall at the same rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. In Newtonian physics, this phenomenon requires the "gravitational mass" (property experiencing a gravitational field) to be numerically identical to "inertial mass" (resistance to acceleration), a coincidence experimentally verified to high precision but unexplained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

In [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | general relativity]], there is no mystery: objects appear to fall at the same rate because they are not accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. They are simply following straight-line paths (geodesics) through curved spacetime until something stops them, just as objects in an accelerating rocket appear to accelerate at the same rate because the floor is accelerating into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Experimental Evidence

When Einstein proposed his theory in 1915, it seemed "far-fetched" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. He predicted a measurable phenomenon: light bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. In an accelerating rocket, light beams would deflect downwards as the rocket speeds up while the light travels across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Therefore, Einstein reasoned, light must also bend when passing a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

The ideal test involved observing light from distant stars passing near the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. A total solar eclipse allowed this observation, and in 1919, Arthur Eddington measured the deflection of starlight, finding it to be twice the amount predicted by a strictly Newtonian model and precisely the amount predicted by [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

Another proposed experiment involves comparing the behavior of a stationary charge in a gravitational field to a free-falling one, regarding electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   A Newtonian view would predict the stationary charge *not* to radiate (as it's not accelerating), but the free-falling one *should* radiate (as it is accelerating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | General relativity]] predicts the opposite: the free-falling charge is non-accelerating (following a geodesic) and thus *should not* radiate, while the stationary charge *is* accelerating (deviating from a geodesic) and therefore *should* give off electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
Logistical challenges have prevented this experiment from being carried out, but the predicted outcome highlights one's true understanding of [[General theory of relativity and gravity | gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

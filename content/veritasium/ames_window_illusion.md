The [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]] is an optical illusion where a continuously rotating trapezoidal window appears to oscillate back and forth, or even pass through other objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It is the first part of a three-part illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Most people perceive the window oscillating back and forth, even though it is actually rotating continuously on a turntable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Window

The window itself is not a rectangle, but a trapezoid, with one side much shorter than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This trapezoidal shape is essential to the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It is also shaded to create a 3D appearance, despite being a 2D card with the same image on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Even when aware of its true shape and motion, the brain still perceives the window as oscillating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Impact of Additional Objects

Adding other objects to the Ames window further highlights the illusion's power:
*   **Rubik's Cube:** When a Rubik's Cube is attached to the short side, it appears to continue rotating while the window oscillates, or even seems to "out drift" in front of the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Ruler:** Placing a ruler through the middle of the window leads to the perception that the ruler is physically passing *through* the window, despite the known physical impossibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The brain prefers the illusion over the continuous rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

The speaker's personal attempts to recreate the illusion on a large scale, even passing through it like the ruler, showed that lighting is crucial for the illusion to work effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Even lighting on both sides helps convince the brain of the oscillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The illusion occurs because when the larger side of the trapezoid moves to the back, it still occupies a larger field of view than the small side, causing the brain to incorrectly perceive it as closer and rotating in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Origin and Explanation

The illusion was created by Adelbert Ames in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Ames, who initially aspired to be a visual artist, was fascinated by how people perceive shapes and shading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### The Carpentered Environment Hypothesis

According to Ames, the key to this illusion lies in our experience living in a "carpentered environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Humans are accustomed to seeing houses, rooms, doors, and windows filled with 90-degree angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. While the images on our retinas are often trapezoids, our brains, through extensive experience, expect them to be rectangles with right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Our brains use these perceived shapes to infer [[interpretation_of_visual_cues_and_reality | depth information]], which is usually correct in our rectilinear world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. However, with a trapezoidal window that the brain assumes to be rectangular, this inference leads to the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Research on Cultural Influence

To test the carpentered environment hypothesis, Harvard psychologists conducted a study in South Africa in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. They tested 80 children aged 10-14, half from urban Durban (rectangular buildings) and half from rural communities (round huts with few 90-degree angles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   When viewed from 10 feet with both eyes open, 60% of urban children reported seeing oscillation, compared to only 17.5% of rural children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This supported the hypothesis that less experience with rectangles reduced susceptibility to the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   However, when viewed from 20 feet away with one eye closed, 90% of all participants saw the oscillation, with no significant difference between groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This indicates that other factors beyond rectangular experience are at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Relation to Anamorphosis and Ames Room

The [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]], along with the de Heer circle (which also appears to oscillate when continuously rotating), utilizes a technique called [[anamorphosis_in_art | anamorphosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. [[anamorphosis_in_art | Anamorphosis]] involves creating a distorted projection of an object that only appears in proper proportion when viewed from a specific position or with a particular device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Historically, this technique has been used in art, such as Hans Holbein the Younger's 1533 painting "The Ambassadors" which reveals a skull from a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, and potentially even in cave paintings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

[[anamorphosis_in_art | Anamorphosis]] is also central to Ames's most famous illusion, the [[ames_room_and_depth_perception | Ames Room]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Designed in 1934, the [[ames_room_and_depth_perception | Ames Room]] is constructed from an ordinary rectangular room by adding a diagonal wall and warping the floor and ceiling based on a privileged viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. When viewed from this specific point with one eye, it appears as an ordinary room, but people moving within it appear to change size dramatically, revealing its true distorted geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Ames realized that an infinite number of distorted room geometries could create the same image of a normal room from a privileged viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Ambiguity and Depth Perception

Our perceptions are constantly faced with ambiguity, and our brains subconsciously decide which of many possibilities we are looking at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This relates to [[ames_room_and_depth_perception | depth perception]], where visual cues like size, brightness, and occlusion are used to infer distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The Ames window plays with these attributes to defy expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

The ability to [[interpretation_of_visual_cues_and_reality | interpret depth cues]] appears to be an innate ability that forms very early in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Studies with babies aged five and a half, seven and a half, and nine months showed that older babies (seven and a half and nine months) were significantly more interested in the Ames window than a normal rotating rectangle, suggesting they perceived its anomalous oscillating motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]] highlights a fundamental misconception about science: the idea that data transparently reveal the best theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. In reality, the same data can arise from vastly different external realities, such as the debate over whether the sun orbits the Earth or vice versa, or modern quantum interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

The illusion serves as a metaphor for life, illustrating that our direct perception of external reality is often an [[interpretation_of_visual_cues_and_reality | interpretation of visual cues and reality]] from an infinite number of possible geometries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This suggests that despite having the same information, people can come to vastly different conclusions about reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Therefore, one should approach the world and conclusions with humility and less certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

Audible, a leading provider of audiobooks, supports content creators whose work involves scientific exploration and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Through [[audible_sponsorship_and_promotions | sponsorship and promotions]], Audible enables creators to travel and engage with scientific communities globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Audible's Offerings

Audible.com provides over 150,000 titles, encompassing fiction, non-fiction, and periodicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. New users can download a book for free or choose any other book for a one-month free trial by visiting specific promotional links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Support for Scientific Endeavors

The financial backing from Audible allows content creators to undertake journeys to meet "great scientists, and filmmakers, and lots of people all around the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This support facilitates in-person interactions and investigations into diverse scientific phenomena and discussions. For instance, the creator was able to visit Olomouc in the Czech Republic partly due to Audible's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Recommended Reading

As part of its support, Audible promotes literature relevant to science and its history. One recommended book is *Galileo's Daughter* by Dava Sobel, which explores the life of Galileo through his daughter's letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This provides insight into Galileo's personal experiences, complementing public knowledge of his scientific work and the [[scientific_debate_and_public_discourse | trials he faced]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The book highlights the human aspect of [[the_role_of_individual_scientists_in_largescale_environmental_changes | individual scientists]] and their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

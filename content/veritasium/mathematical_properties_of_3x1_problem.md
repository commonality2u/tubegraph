The 3x+1 problem, also known as the [[collatz_conjecture_overview | Collatz conjecture]], is considered by some to be the most dangerous problem in mathematics, with young mathematicians often warned not to spend time on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, stated that "Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## How the 3x+1 Problem Works

The problem involves applying two simple rules to any positive integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>:
*   **If the number is odd**: Multiply it by three and add one (3x+1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **If the number is even**: Divide it by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

These rules are applied repeatedly to the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Example Sequence (Starting with 7)
*   7 (odd) → (3 * 7) + 1 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   22 (even) → 22 / 2 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   11 (odd) → (3 * 11) + 1 = 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   34 (even) → 34 / 2 = 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   17 (odd) → (3 * 17) + 1 = 52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   52 (even) → 52 / 2 = 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   26 (even) → 26 / 2 = 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   13 (odd) → (3 * 13) + 1 = 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   40 (even) → 40 / 2 = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   20 (even) → 20 / 2 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   10 (even) → 10 / 2 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   5 (odd) → (3 * 5) + 1 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
*   16 (even) → 16 / 2 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   8 (even) → 8 / 2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   4 (even) → 4 / 2 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   2 (even) → 2 / 2 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

The sequence then enters a [[closed_loop_concept_in_permutations | closed loop]] of 4, 2, 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Collatz Conjecture

The [[collatz_conjecture_overview | Collatz conjecture]] states that every positive integer, when these rules are applied, will eventually end up in the four, two, one loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
It is named after German mathematician Luther Collatz, who may have conceived it in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
It is also known by many other names, including the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Hailstone Numbers and Total Stopping Time
The numbers generated by applying the 3x+1 rules are called "hailstone numbers" because they fluctuate up and down like hailstones before eventually "falling" to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The number of steps it takes for a sequence to reach one is called its "total stopping time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
For example, starting with 26, the sequence takes 10 steps to reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Starting with 27, the sequence climbs as high as 9,232 before falling to one, taking 111 steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:03:11]</a>. The paths of different numbers vary widely, even for numbers adjacent to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Infamy Among Mathematicians

The 3x+1 problem is infamous among professional mathematicians because it has resisted solution for decades despite its simple statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Jeffrey Lagarias, considered the world authority on 3x+1, has warned young mathematicians against working on it to establish their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Some even humorously suggested it was a Soviet invention to slow down U.S. science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Observed Mathematical Properties

### Randomness and Geometric Brownian Motion
While the paths are erratic, when viewed logarithmically, the sequence of hailstone numbers often shows a wiggly graph with a downward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This behavior resembles geometric Brownian motion, similar to stock market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. If the linear trend is removed from the logarithm, the fluctuations appear random, like a coin flip at each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The stock market tends to trend upwards over long periods, while 3x+1 trends downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Benford's Law
Analyzing the leading digits of numbers in 3x+1 sequences reveals a pattern that aligns with Benford's law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. For the first billion sequences, approximately 30% of numbers start with one, 17.5% with two, and the frequency decreases for higher digits, with fewer than 5% starting with nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:06:11]</a>. This distribution is common in various natural and financial datasets, and is even used for fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Benford's law is most applicable when numbers span several orders of magnitude, as they do in 3x+1 sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, it cannot definitively prove whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Statistical Tendency to Shrink
Counterintuitively, despite odd numbers being tripled and even numbers halved, sequences statistically tend to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is because every time an odd number is multiplied by three and one is added (3x+1), the result is *always* an even number, requiring the next step to be division by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Thus, an odd number is effectively increased by a factor of about 3/2 in this two-step process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Considering the path from one odd number to the next odd number:
*   About 50% of the time, dividing by two brings it back to an odd number (factor of 3/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   About 25% of the time, it divides by four before reaching the next odd number (factor of 3/4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   About 12.5% of the time, it divides by eight (factor of 3/8), and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The geometric mean of these transformations is approximately 3/4, which is less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Therefore, statistically, 3x+1 sequences are more likely to shrink than grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. For example, 341 becomes 1024 after 3x+1, which then divides by two ten times to reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Visualization Techniques

### Directed Graph
One way to visualize the problem is by showing how each number connects to the next in its sequence, forming a "directed graph" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This graph resembles a tree or streams flowing into each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. If the conjecture is true, every number, even those from infinity, eventually flows into the "massive river" of the four, two, one loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Rotated Graph
Some mathematicians have modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number: anticlockwise for odd numbers and clockwise for even numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Adjusting the degree of rotation creates "beautiful, organic-looking shapes" resembling coral or seaweed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This [[visualization_techniques_for_understanding_the_conjecture | visualization technique for understanding the conjecture]] highlights the intricate nature resulting from a simple operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

## Challenges to the Conjecture

The [[collatz_conjecture_overview | Collatz conjecture]] could be false in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>:
1.  **Divergent Sequence**: A number might start a sequence that grows infinitely and never reaches one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
2.  **Alternative Closed Loop**: A sequence of numbers might form a [[closed_loop_concept_in_permutations | closed loop]] other than four, two, one, disconnected from the main graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Brute Force Testing
As of 2019, mathematicians have tested every number by brute force up to 2^68 (approximately 295 quintillion numbers), and every single one has been confirmed to eventually fall to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Based on this, any hypothetical loop other than 4,2,1 would have to be at least 186 billion numbers long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Progress Towards Proof
A potential method to prove the conjecture is to show that every 3x+1 sequence contains a number smaller than its original seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. If this were proven, it would imply that all sequences must eventually reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Significant progress has been made in demonstrating this for "almost all" numbers:
*   **1976 (Riho Terras)**: Showed that "almost all" Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **1979**: The limit was reduced to less than X^(0.869) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **1994**: Further lowered to less than X^(0.7925) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **2019 (Terry Tao)**: Showed that "almost all" numbers will eventually become smaller than any arbitrarily slow-growing function (e.g., log x, log log x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This is considered "about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture without actually solving it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

However, "almost all" has a technical mathematical definition: as the numbers being examined go to infinity, the fraction that meet the criteria goes to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This does not mean "all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. For example, "almost all" numbers are not perfect squares, yet there are infinitely many perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Negative Numbers
When the 3x+1 rules are applied to negative numbers, the behavior changes significantly. Instead of a single loop, there are three independent [[closed_loop_concept_in_permutations | closed loop]]s: (-1) → (-2) → (-1), (-5) → (-14) → (-7) → (-20) → (-10) → (-5), and (-17) → (-50) → (-25) → (-74) → (-37) → (-110) → (-55) → (-164) → (-82) → (-41) → (-122) → (-61) → (-182) → (-91) → (-272) → (-136) → (-68) → (-34) → (-17) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The existence of these disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line raises questions about why they don't appear on the positive side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### The Possibility of Undecidability

Given the lack of a proof despite extensive effort and testing, some mathematicians consider the possibility that the [[collatz_conjecture_overview | Collatz conjecture]] is [[undecidability_in_mathematical_systems | undecidable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
In 1987, John Conway created a generalization of 3x+1 called FRACTRAN, a mathematical machine that is Turing-complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This means FRACTRAN can perform any computation a modern computer can, but it is also subject to the halting problem, where a program might never stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. While this doesn't directly prove that 3x+1 is undecidable, it suggests the possibility that a definitive proof (or disproof) might never be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

> "You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>

The problem highlights the peculiar and intricate nature of numbers, where simple operations can lead to intractable complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

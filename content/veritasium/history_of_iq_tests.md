The term "IQ" is ubiquitous in popular culture, often understood as an objective and rigorous measurement of intellectual ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores the origins of IQ testing, its evolution, what it purports to measure, its predictive capabilities, and its controversial history.

## Origins of Intelligence Testing

The concept of intelligence testing dates back hundreds of years, but a significant breakthrough occurred in 1904 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Charles Spearman and the G-Factor
English psychologist Charles Spearman studied students' grades in various subjects, like English and Math, to understand how performance in one related to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. He considered three possibilities for correlation:
*   **Negative Correlation:** Better performance in one subject leads to worse performance in another (e.g., more time on Math means less on English) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **No Correlation:** Performance in one subject is completely unrelated to another, given different skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Positive Correlation:** Better performance in Math corresponds to better performance in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Spearman found a clear positive correlation, with a coefficient of 0.64, indicating that students who excelled in one subject generally excelled in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. To explain this, he proposed that each person possesses a level of **general intelligence**, which he termed the **g-factor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This construct aimed to capture how quickly students could learn new material, recognize patterns, and think critically, regardless of subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He published these findings in "General Intelligence" Objectively Determined and Measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Spearman also acknowledged that correlations weren't perfect, suggesting the existence of **subject-specific factors (s-factors)**. A student's performance in a subject would depend on their general intelligence plus their s-factor for that subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. While he believed s-factors could be trained, he considered general intelligence (g-factor) to be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### The Binet-Simon Test and the Birth of IQ
Around the same time in France, Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon developed the **Binet-Simon test** to identify children needing additional academic support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This test included tasks like naming missing objects in drawings, defining abstract terms, and repeating sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Students' performance was benchmarked against others of different ages to assign them a "mental age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The mental age was then divided by their chronological age and multiplied by 100 to yield an **intelligence quotient**, thus giving birth to the term "IQ" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The Binet-Simon test was the world's first IQ test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. It was translated into English by Henry Goddard and introduced to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. At Stanford, Lewis Terman standardized it using a large American sample, leading to the widely used **Stanford-Binet test** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## [[What IQ tests actually measure | What IQ Tests Actually Measure]]

Modern IQ tests aim to measure the g-factor by assessing diverse mental abilities, such as memory, verbal, spatial, and numerical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. By averaging scores across many sections, the intention is for subject-specific effects to cancel out, providing an approximation of g <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

To standardize scoring, tests are administered to a large population sample, and raw scores are normalized, typically with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This scaling means 68% of people score between 85 and 115, while only about 2% score above 130 or below 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Common question types found on modern IQ tests include:
*   **Vocabulary:** Identifying synonyms or antonyms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Number Patterns:** Completing sequences by identifying mathematical relationships (e.g., differences, ratios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Raven's Progressive Matrices:** Identifying patterns in a 3x3 grid of symbols (e.g., translational motion, rotational motion, missing symbols, addition/subtraction of lines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

Most modern IQ tests are administered under strict time pressure, often allowing only 10 to 30 seconds per question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### [[Predictive power of IQ | Predictive Power of IQ]]

An hour or two of questions can predict several aspects of an individual's life:
*   **Brain Size:** Higher IQ correlates with larger brain size, with a meta-analysis showing a correlation of 0.33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **School Success:** IQ is a strong predictor of academic performance. A study of 13,000 11-year-olds found a correlation of about 0.8 between IQ and national school examination scores five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This means about two-thirds of the variation in exam scores could be predicted by IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Tests like the SAT, ACT, and GRE are argued to be essentially IQ tests, correlating at around 0.8 with standard IQ tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Job Success:** IQ can predict occupational success, particularly in technical or highly complex jobs, with correlations typically ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The U.S. military, for example, sets a minimum IQ of 80 for recruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Longevity:** Studies suggest a correlation between higher IQ and a lower risk of dying during a given timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. A Scottish study found that for every 15-point increase in IQ at age 11, individuals were 27% more likely to be alive at age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Income:** While IQ shows a tendency for income to increase with it (correlation of 0.3 in one study), the variance is large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. A meta-analysis of 31 studies found a correlation of 0.21 between IQ and income, explaining only 4.4% of the variance in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. The relationship with net worth is even weaker, showing little correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## [[Controversies and criticisms of IQ tests | Controversies and Criticisms of IQ Tests]]

Despite its predictive power, IQ has a "dark history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

### Eugenics Movement and Misuse
When Henry Goddard introduced Binet's test to America, its use and interpretation drastically changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Unlike Binet, who believed intelligence could be improved through education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, American researchers like Spearman often believed the g-factor was unchangeable and inherited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

IQ test results were used by Henry Goddard to bolster the **American eugenics movement**, which aimed to prevent individuals with "undesirable traits" from having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Laws were passed in many states allowing forced sterilization of those who scored below a certain IQ threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. These laws were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1927 in *Buck v. Bell*, with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously stating, "Three generations of imbeciles are enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Over 60,000 people were forcibly sterilized, and these laws served as a model for Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. This history is a primary reason many disregard IQ today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### Re-evaluating Early Assumptions
Modern scientific understanding challenges several early assumptions about IQ:
*   **Genetics vs. Environment:** IQ is not entirely determined by genetics. While there is evidence for a genetic basis (identical twins show strong IQ correlations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, twin studies suggest that over a lifespan, the split between heritability and environment is roughly 50/50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **Fixedness:** [[Impacts of education and culture on IQ | Education can improve IQ]], meaning it is not completely fixed over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   **Single Construct:** Intelligence may not be a single construct (g-factor). Scientists now recognize:
    *   **Fluid intelligence:** Ability to learn, process information, and solve novel problems, peaking in early adulthood and then declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
    *   **Crystallized intelligence:** Accumulated knowledge over a lifetime, which remains more stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

### [[Controversies and criticisms of IQ tests | Broader Cultural and Environmental Impacts]]
IQ tests have been misused to promote ideas of racial differences in intelligence, citing observed gaps between groups or purported low average IQs in certain nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. However, this is largely considered a misrepresentation of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

The **Flynn Effect** demonstrates that average IQ scores have increased steadily over the past century, requiring tests to be re-normalized periodically to maintain an average of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. This approximately 30-point increase over 100 years cannot be explained by genetic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. Proposed causes for the Flynn Effect include:
*   Improved childhood nutrition and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
*   Better education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
*   A societal shift from manual labor to more abstract thinking in work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

This indicates that cultural changes significantly affect average IQ scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. The idea of "culture fair" IQ tests is largely seen as a marketing term, as it's impossible to create a test equally valid across all cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Cultures differ in fundamental ways, such as vocabulary for shapes or spatial relations, influencing how people categorize and think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. IQ tests also do not assess forms of intelligence critical for survival in other cultures, such as ethnobotanical knowledge or hunting skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

### [[What IQ tests actually measure | Other Factors Affecting IQ Test Scores]]
Beyond the g-factor, other elements influence an individual's IQ test score:
*   **Motivation:** Incentivizing test-takers with money can increase IQ scores by up to 20 points, especially for those with below-average IQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
*   **Training and Coaching:** Familiarizing oneself with IQ-style questions and specific patterns can boost scores by up to eight points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
*   **Test-Taking Strategy:** Skills like knowing when to skip questions, eliminating wrong answers, and guessing under time pressure can impact results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Anxiety:** While a small amount of anxiety can be beneficial, excessive anxiety negatively affects performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

## Current Applications and Perspectives

Despite its contentious history, IQ testing still has practical applications. In forensic neuroscience, for example, IQ tests are used in capital punishment cases for the **Atkins defense**, which eliminates the death penalty for individuals with intellectual disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. These tests include embedded measures to detect attempts to fake poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

IQ tests can also be used to:
*   Identify individuals with strong intellectual abilities who may not have demonstrated them otherwise, particularly in gifted programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. Replacing teacher recommendations with standardized IQ tests has been shown to increase the proportion of poorer and minority ethnic children in gifted programs, as it provides a more objective measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
*   Potentially inform strategies to boost cognitive ability early in life to delay functional decline later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

There is a "love-hate relationship" with IQ in psychology and the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Extremist views exist on both sides: those who claim IQ is the most important factor for classifying people and those who dismiss tests as entirely useless tools of racism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. A more moderate view suggests that while IQ tells us something, it does not determine an individual's worth or how their life will turn out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. Personal growth, knowledge accumulation, and analytical skill development can dramatically improve outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. The only personality trait that correlates with IQ is openness to experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. As Stephen Hawking suggested, "People who brag about their IQ are losers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.

A Geiger counter measures [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | ionizing radiation]], which is radiation with enough energy to strip electrons from atoms, and is measured in units called Sieverts (Sv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Exposure to more than two Sieverts all at once is typically lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Background Radiation and Everyday Exposures

Humans are constantly exposed to low levels of [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Bananas** are rich in naturally radioactive potassium, exposing a person to about 0.1 microSieverts when eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Sleeping next to another person** exposes an individual to more radiation than sleeping alone, though the dose is insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Natural background radiation** on Earth comes from soil, rocks, air, and space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   The average global background radiation level is typically between 0.1 and 0.2 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. In Sydney, for example, it is about 0.15 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Specific Historical Sites and Their Current Radiation Levels

This section explores radiation levels at various historical nuclear sites and places significant to the discovery of [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | radioactivity]].

### Hiroshima, Japan

The world's first nuclear bomb was detonated approximately 600 meters above the Peace Dome in Hiroshima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Current Radiation Level (almost 70 years later):** 0.3 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### JÃ¡chymov Uranium Mine (Czech Republic)

This old uranium mine is where uranium was discovered and where Marie Curie obtained her raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Current Radiation Level in the mine:** About 1.7 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is approximately 10 times the natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Most uranium has been removed, but small fluorescent pieces can still be found in the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Marie Curie's Laboratory (France)

In Marie Curie's lab, where she conducted much of her work and won two Nobel Prizes (Physics and Chemistry), some items remain radioactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Radioactive Doorknob:** Shows levels about 10 times the background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Back of her Chair:** Still emits alpha particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. It's believed traces of radium were left there after she handled materials in the lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Trinity Bomb Test Site, New Mexico (USA)

This site is where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The immense heat from the bomb fused desert sand into a green glass called trinitite, which is unique to this location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Current Radiation Level at the site:** About 0.8 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Trinitite:** Reads slightly higher, around 2 or 3 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor No. 4, Ukraine

Chernobyl reactor number four melted down on April 26, 1986, spreading radioactive isotopes throughout the surrounding area and into Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Current Radiation Level at the reactor site:** Around 5 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This is not considered a huge amount; one hour of exposure is similar to a dental x-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This relatively lower level is partly due to the removal of several meters of topsoil from the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Pripyat Hospital Basement:** This location, where the Chernobyl firemen's highly contaminated clothing was left, is one of the most radioactive places on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   Readings just outside the door reached 500 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    *   Inside, levels reached 1,500 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   An hour of exposure in the basement would result in a dose of 2,000 microSieverts, equivalent to a year's worth of natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Fukushima Exclusion Zone, Japan

The Fukushima nuclear power disaster involved a release of radioactive material that was less than Chernobyl (approximately 10% of the release) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, because it was a more recent accident (3 years prior at the time of filming), less of the material had decayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Similar to Chernobyl, topsoil was being collected and removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Current Radiation Levels in the Exclusion Zone:** Readings were observed to be around 5 to 10 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Estimated Lifetime Exposure:** People living around Fukushima are estimated to receive an additional 10,000 microSieverts over their lifetime due to the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_radiation_exposure_in_different_scenarios | Comparison of Radiation Exposure]]

For context, here are some other significant radiation exposures:
*   **Airplane Travel:** As altitude increases, there is less atmosphere to shield from [[historical_discoveries_about_cosmic_rays | cosmic rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   18,000 ft: 0.5 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
    *   23,000 ft: 1 microSievert per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
    *   33,000 ft: Over 2 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
    *   Higher altitudes and towards the poles: Over 3 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
*   **CT Scan:** A patient receives about 7,000 microSieverts, which is 3 years worth of natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Radiation Workers:** Limited to a maximum of 50,000 microSieverts per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **[[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | Astronauts]] on the Space Station:** A 6-month stay results in about 80,000 microSieverts of [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Smoker's Lungs:** On average, a smoker's lungs receive 160,000 microSieverts of [[health_risks_associated_with_smoking_and_radiation_exposure | radiation]] every year due to radioactive polonium and lead in tobacco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This makes an ordinary smoker the individual who receives the highest doses of [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Grant Gussman memorized 23,000 digits of pi, which he does not recommend as a party trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This feat was inspired by a video discussing the two systems of thought: System Two (conscious, slow, effortful) and System One (subconscious, fast, automatic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. To explore these systems, Grant initially aimed to memorize 100 digits of pi and then continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Nature of Expertise

Experts, such as five-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen, appear to possess superhuman abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Carlsen can identify the game from which a chessboard position came and even recognize an opening and the player who played black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, scientific research decades ago revealed that chess masters are not exceptional in terms of IQ, spatial reasoning, or short-term memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### The Role of Chunking

A key experiment in 1973 by William Chase and Herbert Simon demonstrated the superior performance of chess masters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. They tested a master, an advanced amateur (A player), and a beginner on their ability to replicate chess board setups after a five-second look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   **Realistic Setup**:
    *   Master: Recalled 16 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   A player: Recalled 8 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
    *   Beginner: Recalled 4 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    *   The master needed only half the peeks of the A player to perfect their board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Random Setup**: When pieces were arranged randomly (not as they would appear in a game), the chess master performed no better than the beginner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. All players remembered only three pieces after the first look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

This indicates that [[chess_mastery_and_chunking | chess mastery and chunking]] is not about general memory, but memory specific to real chess positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Experts learn patterns from extensive experience, recognizing configurations as single "chunks" rather than individual elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. For example, the sequence "30173" can be chunked by a basketball fan to mean "Stephen Curry number 30, won 73 games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

At its core, expertise is recognition, leading directly to intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Chess masters instinctively know the best move because they recognize board positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## [[The criteria for becoming an expert | The criteria for becoming an expert]]

Developing the long-term memory of an expert takes a considerable amount of time, with "10,000 hours" often cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. However, 10,000 hours of practice alone is not enough; four additional criteria must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In areas where these are not met, expertise is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### 1. Many Repeated Attempts with Feedback

Experts engage in hundreds or thousands of repetitions, each providing feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Tennis players hitting forehands, chess players playing games, physicists solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Feedback is clear: shot in/out, win/loss, problem right/wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Counter-example**: Political pundits who comment on political and economic trends perform worse than random chance at predicting future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This is because the events they predict are often "one-offs" with no repeated experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### 2. A Valid Environment

An expert environment must contain regularities that make it at least somewhat predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Example**: Chess is a valid environment because patterns can be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Counter-example**: A roulette wheel is a low validity environment because it's essentially random, even with repeated experiences and clear feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   The stock market is also a low validity environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Warren Buffet's bet against Wall Street hedge funds demonstrated that actively managed funds rarely beat a simple index fund over the long term (80% fail over 10 years, 90% over longer periods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Stock price movements are almost entirely random in the short term, so feedback doesn't reflect decision-making quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   [[Challenges in recognizing expertise in low validity environments | Challenges in recognizing expertise in low validity environments]] arise because humans tend to seek patterns even in randomness. An experiment showed rats consistently chose the 80% winning option, while humans tried to predict patterns, resulting in a lower success rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### 3. Clear, Timely Feedback

Learning patterns requires prompt feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   Anesthesiologists receive immediate feedback on patient stability during surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
    *   YouTube creators receive performance metrics for their videos within the first hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Counter-examples**:
    *   Radiologists often don't receive rapid feedback on their diagnoses, making improvement difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. They correctly diagnose breast cancer from X-rays only 70% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
    *   College admissions officers and recruitment specialists face delayed or absent feedback on the success of admitted students or hired employees, hindering their ability to recognize patterns in ideal candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. A study by Richard Melton showed an algorithm using minimal information outperformed most counselors in predicting college grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### 4. Deliberate Practice

Even with valid environments and timely feedback, improvement ceases once competence is reached in a comfortable zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. To become an expert, practice must be at the edge of one's ability, pushing beyond the comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This requires intense concentration and methodical repetition of difficult tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

*   **Comfortable Practice**: Driving (becomes automatic after ~50 hours) or playing the same songs on guitar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This does not lead to continued improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Deliberate Practice**:
    *   Doctors with 20 years of experience were worse at diagnosing rare heart or lung diseases than recent graduates because they hadn't thought about those diseases in a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. They improved only after a refresher course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
    *   In chess, the best predictor of skill is not games played, but hours dedicated to serious solitary study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This involves learning theory, studying games, and solving tactical puzzles designed to build pattern recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
    *   Coaches and teachers are valuable for identifying weaknesses and assigning tasks to address them, facilitating deliberate practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

### Conclusion on Expertise

True expertise is recognition, derived from a vast amount of highly structured information stored in long-term memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. To build this memory and become an expert, four criteria are necessary: a valid environment, many repetitions, timely feedback, and thousands of hours of deliberate practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. When these conditions are met, human performance can be astonishing; otherwise, individuals perceived as experts may not truly be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## Strategies for Learning and Growth

To become a STEM expert, actively interacting with problems and pushing outside your comfort zone is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This aligns with the concept of deliberate practice, as it involves engaging with challenging material and learning from hints when stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Building the habit of embracing discomfort and regularly learning something new is the path to lifelong learning and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

The [[firstever_image_of_a_black_hole | first-ever image of a black hole]], released by the [[Event Horizon Telescope and its results | Event Horizon Telescope]] (EHT) collaboration on April 10, 2019, was captured using electromagnetic waves in the radio spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Wavelength Selection and Benefits

Scientists specifically used electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters, which are radio waves, to create the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This part of the spectrum was chosen for several crucial reasons:
*   It allows for the visualization of features located very close to the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   These radio waves can successfully pass through the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] and interstellar dust, reaching Earth-based telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## The Image of M87*

The groundbreaking image shows plasma orbiting the supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] at the center of the galaxy M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] has a mass 6.5 billion times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Plasma and Relativistic Beaming

The bright region in the image indicates where plasma is moving towards observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Because this plasma travels near the speed of light, it appears brighter when moving towards us and dimmer when moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This phenomenon is known as [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_black_holes | relativistic beaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. From the image, scientists deduced that the plasma orbits clockwise, completing one orbit in approximately two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Jets and Accretion Disks

The supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] in M87 is highly active, constantly consuming matter from its hot, glowing [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It also features narrow, collimated jets extending above and below it, thought to be generated by incredibly strong magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These jets can extend at least 5,000 light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. One of these jets appears to be pointing almost directly towards Earth, a visibility again attributed to [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_black_holes | relativistic beaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Challenges in Imaging

The image of the M87 [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] appears "fuzzy" due to its extremely small apparent size from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Despite the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]]'s immense physical size—its shadow is nearly the size of our solar system—it is located 53.5 million light-years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Its angular size from our perspective is only about 40 micro arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

To achieve the necessary resolution for such a tiny angular size, basic laws of physics, specifically the diffraction limit, dictate the need for a telescope the size of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. As this is impractical, scientists utilized eight telescopes globally, observing M87 simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The Earth's rotation helped to simulate the effect of a single, Earth-sized telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Other Observations: Sagittarius A*

The [[Event Horizon Telescope and its results | Event Horizon Telescope]] also observed Sagittarius A*, the supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] at the center of our Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Although much closer at around 26,000 light-years away, it is also significantly smaller, with a mass only four million times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Sagittarius A* is less active, only periodically accreting matter, and exhibits much more rapid variation, with matter orbiting every four to thirty minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. An image of this [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] has not yet been released, partly due to these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Significance

The striking [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | image of the black hole in M87]] definitively confirms the existence of [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This observation provides spectacular support for the General Theory of Relativity, published over a century ago, particularly at the limits of strong gravity and our ability to test the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

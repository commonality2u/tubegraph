The Earth is constantly bombarded by debris from space. These impacts, ranging from small to catastrophic, have significant [[effects_on_earth_and_astronomical_bodies | effects on Earth and astronomical bodies]].

## Recent Impact: The Chelyabinsk Event

On February 15, 2013, an asteroid heavier than the Eiffel Tower struck Earth's atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_event | Chelyabinsk asteroid event]] exploded 30 kilometers above the ground, producing a flash brighter than the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The explosion was silent for 90 seconds due to its height, which worsened the devastation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. People looking out windows were injured when a shockwave hit, blowing out glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The shockwave damaged thousands of buildings and injured 1500 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Embarrassingly, this event occurred on the same day scientists had predicted a different asteroid, Duende, would make a close fly-by of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Duende came within 27,000 kilometers of Earth's surface, closer than geosynchronous satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Despite correctly predicting Duende's approach, they completely missed the unrelated asteroid that exploded over Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Since 1988, over 1200 asteroids larger than a meter have collided with Earth, but only five were detected before impact, never with more than a day's warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Origin and Detection of Asteroids

Asteroids are the leftover debris from the formation of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. They formed from rocks and dust clumping into molten protoplanets, which then collided and broke into smaller fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This origin explains why some asteroids are rocky rubble piles, while others, from the cores of planetesimals, are mostly metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. An iron meteorite is essentially a piece of a small planetary body's core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Most asteroids have stable orbits in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, some have moved closer to Earth, becoming [[nearearth_objects_and_their_detection_difficulties | Near Earth Objects]] (NEOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Stephen Hawking considered an asteroid impact to be the greatest threat to life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Challenges in Detection
Finding asteroids is difficult for several reasons:
*   **Visibility:** Most are spotted by ground-based telescopes looking for "moving dots" against static stars and galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Size:** Asteroids range from meters to kilometers in size and are hard to spot in the vastness of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The Chelyabinsk meteor was only about 20 meters in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Reflectivity:** They are rough and dark, reflecting only about 15% of the light that hits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. They are best seen when fully illuminated by the sun, which means 85% of detected NEOs are found in the 45 degrees of sky directly opposite the sun (the opposition effect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This means any asteroid approaching from the direction of the sun, like Chelyabinsk, is nearly impossible to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

While a million asteroids have been cataloged, only 24,000 are NEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Orbital Prediction Difficulties
Even after detection, predicting an asteroid's trajectory is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>:
*   **Limited Data:** Early observations provide only a small arc of motion, making long-term prediction difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Years of observations are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Dynamical Chaos:** Planetary gravity constantly influences asteroid orbits, leading to "dynamical chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This means predictions are generally accurate for a maximum of about 100 years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Consequences of Impact

The [[history_of_significant_asteroid_impacts | history of significant asteroid impacts]] shows dramatic results.

### Barringer Crater
Barringer Crater in Arizona, named after Daniel Barringer, was formed by an iron meteorite impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Barringer mistakenly believed the meteorite would be intact and attempted to mine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. However, when an impact occurs at high speed (e.g., 30 kilometers per second), the [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] is so immense that it completely vaporizes the projectile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The superheated, high-pressure gas then explodes, creating the crater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The 50-meter asteroid that formed Barringer Crater (only slightly larger than Chelyabinsk) released energy equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT, over 600 times the energy of the Hiroshima bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Thus, an asteroid impact closely resembles a large nuclear explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Dinosaur Extinction Event
The dinosaurs were wiped out by a 10-kilometer asteroid impact approximately 65 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Asteroids above a critical size (a couple of kilometers) deliver enough energy to have a global effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Such an impact launches debris into sub-orbital trajectories that fall back to Earth globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This phenomenon causes the entire sky to light up with "wall-to-wall meteors," turning the sky into a "red, hot glow" like being inside a toaster oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The intense heat would "cook everything on the ground," allowing only animals living underground or in water to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Future Impact Probabilities
*   **10-kilometer asteroid (like the KT extinction event):** The chance of dying from such an impact in your lifetime is effectively zero, as no 10-kilometer impactors are predicted to intersect Earth's path for the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **1-2 kilometer asteroids:** These are capable of causing massive local damage, equivalent to obliterating a country the size of France or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. We believe we have identified 90-98% of these bodies and can make reasonable predictions for their orbits for the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Hundred-meter asteroids:** This size poses a significant threat. They are large enough to obliterate a major city, causing buildings to collapse, city-wide fires, and high-speed ejecta that would devastate a hundred-kilometer zone around the impact site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. We are missing a lot of these projectiles, and an impact from one "could happen tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Deflection Strategies

Currently, there are no effective [[current_and_potential_asteroid_deflection_strategies | current and potential asteroid deflection strategies]] for kilometer-sized or larger asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Options considered include:
*   **Bombing:** Blowing up an asteroid is problematic as fragments would likely re-form into a rubble pile due to gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Rocket Nudging:** Attaching a rocket to gently push an asteroid aside is impractical due to the massive thrust required and the need for rockets to remain attached for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Ablation with Lasers:** Boiling off the surface with lasers is not feasible with current technology; we lack sufficiently powerful lasers that could be transported to the asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Wrapping in Foil:** Covering an asteroid in reflective foil to change its radiative properties and nudge its orbit is also not currently achievable due to the scale of material and deployment challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

Even the most hopeful strategy, evacuating a city, is extremely difficult for a large metropolitan area due to traffic congestion and the inability to move millions of people quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

The most practical immediate step is to enhance detection capabilities: "Let's do the surveys. Let's build the telescopes. Let's put this telescope in space. That will be a major contribution to understanding the threat from the asteroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Once a dangerous object is identified, focused efforts can then begin to develop deflection methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

The speed of light in a vacuum is defined as exactly 299,792,458 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Since 1983, this value has been used to define the length of a meter, where a meter is the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458ths of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This definition ensures the speed of light is precisely this number, with no decimals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Despite this precise definition, it's argued that light may never actually travel at this speed in a single direction because no one has truly measured its one-way speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Challenges in Measuring the Oneway Speed of Light

Measuring the speed of light isn't as straightforward as measuring the speed of other objects, like a baseball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For a baseball, speed is calculated by dividing the distance between two points by the time it takes to travel that distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

However, applying this to light introduces significant [[challenges_in_measuring_the_oneway_speed_of_light | challenges]]:
*   **Single Clock at Start** If a laser is fired for one kilometer and a timer starts, how can you know when the light reaches the end if you and the clock are at the starting point? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
*   **Two Clocks and Synchronization** Using two clocks, one at the start and one at the end, requires them to be perfectly synchronized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   **Wire Synchronization** Connecting clocks with a wire and sending a pulse would introduce a time delay, as the pulse itself travels at the speed of light â€“ the very speed being measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Subtracting this delay is circular, as its value is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   **Moving Clocks Apart** Synchronizing clocks together then moving one to the endpoint also fails due to [[inertial_observers_and_equivalence_principle | special relativity]]. Moving clocks tick slower relative to stationary observers, causing them to desynchronize by the time they are in position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This means [[oneway_speed_of_light_and_its_implications | time dilation]] can depend on direction if the speed of light does, making slow movement insufficient to avoid the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Measuring the Roundtrip Speed of Light

The only practical solution to these synchronization problems is to use a single clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This involves placing a mirror at the distant end to reflect the light back to the starting point, where a single clock times the full round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Historical Measurement: Fizeau's Experiment (1849)

The speed of light was first experimentally measured by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   He used a rapidly spinning gear and shone a beam of light through its teeth to a mirror located eight kilometers away on a hill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   By increasing the gear's speed, he reached a point where the reflected light passed through the *next* gap on the gear, allowing it to be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   Fizeau measured the speed of light to be 313,000 kilometers per second, which is within 5% of the currently accepted value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This method, and all subsequent accurate measurements, have determined the *roundtrip* or *two-way* speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. No one has measured the [[oneway_speed_of_light_and_its_implications | one-way speed of light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## The Convention of One-Way Speed

It's possible that the speed of light in one direction is different from its speed in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For example, light could travel at half of 'c' (the conventional speed of light) in one direction and be instantaneous on the return journey, yet the roundtrip measurement would still yield 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### The Mars Astronaut Analogy

Consider communicating with an astronaut on Mars, Mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   A signal sent from Earth receives a response 20 minutes later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Conventionally, we assume the signal took 10 minutes to reach Mars and 10 minutes for the reply to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   However, it's equally possible that the outgoing message took all 20 minutes to reach Mars, and the reply came back instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. There's no experimental way to distinguish between these two scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

This concept arises because there might be a preferred direction through spacetime, given the universe's asymmetries like the matter-antimatter imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Physicists have developed internally consistent theories where the speed of light differs forwards and in reverse, ranging from small percentages to 'c'/2 and infinitely fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Einstein Synchronization Convention

The idea that light travels at the same speed in all directions is a *convention*, not an experimentally verified fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Albert Einstein himself acknowledged this in his 1905 paper, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   He noted that meaningfully comparing times measured by clocks at different locations (A and B) requires a definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   He stipulated, "by definition, that the time required by light to travel from A to B equals the time it requires to travel from B to A" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   This is known as the [[Einstein synchronization convention]], and it's a stipulation about the [[nature_of_light | physical nature of light]], chosen to define simultaneity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Therefore, the only aspect of the speed of light that can be truly defined and measured is its two-way speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This is why light clocks in physics often show light bouncing back and forth, representing the round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The two-way speed of light is the only constant for all [[inertial_observers_and_equivalence_principle | inertial observers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Failed Attempts to Measure One-Way Speed

For over 100 years, scientists have attempted to measure the one-way speed of light independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. However, all proposed methods eventually revert to measuring the two-way speed:
*   **High-Speed Camera**: A camera shooting at a trillion frames per second might seem to show light passing through an object, but it's actually capturing the light bouncing back to the camera, thus measuring the two-way speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Fiber Optic Cable**: Using a long fiber optic cable (e.g., 186,000 miles) to measure the delay of light from one end to the other doesn't work. The light travels around and around, and any directional differences in speed would average out, essentially resulting in many round trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Central Synchronizing Device**: Placing a synchronizing device between two clocks and sending out simultaneous pulses would perfectly synchronize the clocks *only if* the speed of light is the same in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. If the speed of light differs, one clock would be ahead, by precisely the amount that would make the one-way speed appear to be 'c' when measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This is why GPS synchronized clocks also cannot measure the one-way speed of light, as the entire system assumes the speed of light is uniform in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Moving Clocks with Equal Opposite Speeds**: Starting with synchronized clocks in the middle and moving them apart at equal and opposite speeds would result in the same time dilation for each clock, seemingly keeping them synchronized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. But this too relies on the assumption that the speed of light is the same in all directions, because if it's not, then [[oneway_speed_of_light_and_its_implications | time dilation]] itself would also depend on direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

The fundamental issue is a [[challenges_in_measuring_the_oneway_speed_of_light | paradox]]: synchronized clocks are needed to measure the one-way speed of light, but the one-way speed of light must be known to synchronize clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## Implications for Simultaneity and Physics

The inability to measure the one-way speed of light has profound implications, particularly for the concept of simultaneity across distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   If the speed of light from Earth to Mars is 'c'/2 and instantaneous from Mars to Earth, yet the Einstein convention is used, clocks on Earth and Mars would be out of sync by 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   For example, if Earth sends a message at noon that takes 20 minutes to reach Mars (at 'c'/2), Mark on Mars (assuming 10-minute travel) would set his clock to 12:10 PM, even though it's 12:20 PM on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. His instantaneous reply would reach Earth at 12:20 PM Earth time, making it seem like synchronization was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   However, if Earth then asks how long the message took, it would take another 20 minutes to reach Mars (arriving at 12:30 Mars time due to the offset), and Mark would still respond "10 minutes," which would instantly reach Earth at 12:40 Earth time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The experience for both communicators would be the same, but their clocks would be out of sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

This demonstrates the flexibility in defining the same moment at two different locations and the one-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. While Einstein chose the convention where the one-way speed is always the same, any other convention is experimentally just as valid, provided the roundtrip works out to 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

For instance, if light were instantaneous coming back to Earth, an observer on Earth would see Mars or distant stars in real-time, exactly as they are at that instant, rather than as they were minutes or centuries ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. The fact that we only know about light when it reaches us means an instantaneous interpretation of its journey is just as valid as one where it takes 'c' to reach us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

This is an unknowable aspect of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Physicists mostly accept the convention for simplicity (Occam's razor), but it remains a convention, not an empirically verified fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The implications extend to the concept of simultaneity: does it make sense to talk about things happening at the same time if they are separated by distance? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a> It's speculated that this inability to measure the one-way speed of light could be a clue for future [[experiments_and_predictions_related_to_general_relativity | paradigmatic leaps]] in physics, connecting [[experiments_and_predictions_related_to_general_relativity | General Relativity]], Quantum Mechanics, space, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

An infinity mirror, with its multiple reflections, provides a good visualization of how [[interference_of_light | light]] makes many round trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

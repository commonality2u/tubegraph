The definition of the kilogram has evolved significantly, with the current International Prototype Kilogram (IPK), known as "Le Grand K," being the sole physical object defining an SI unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. However, [[history_and_evolution_of_the_kilogram_definition | Le Grand K's mass has proven unstable over time]], leading to a search for a more robust, constant definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. This instability affects four of the seven base SI units, as well as derived units like Newtons, Joules, Volts, and Watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. To address this, two primary alternative approaches are being developed.

## The Silicon Sphere Method

One approach involves defining the kilogram based on a precise count of atoms in a perfect crystal, specifically using a sphere of silicon-28 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

### The Silicon Sphere

This sphere, weighing 1 kg, consists of approximately 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The raw material for its creation was worth 1 million Euros, and the final precisely sculpted sphere is considered priceless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It is regarded as the roundest object in the world; if scaled to the size of the Earth, the difference between its highest "mountain" and lowest "valley" would be only about 14 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The use of a sphere simplifies characterization, as knowing its diameter allows for the entire dimension of the object to be determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. The sphere is crafted by starting with an oversized piece and progressively grinding it finer and finer using abrasives, working to control the shape at an atomic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. Its diameter is measured precisely using a laser system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

### Redefining Avogadro's Constant

The silicon sphere is made from pure silicon, existing as a perfect crystal with no voids or dislocations, and contains only one isotope: silicon-28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. By accurately measuring the sphere's diameter, its volume can be determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. Since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, the total number of atoms within the sphere can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

This process allows for the [[redefining_the_kilogram_with_avogadros_constant | redefinition of Avogadro's constant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Currently, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram, representing the number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon-12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. With the silicon sphere approach, the number of silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then in turn define the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

Under this new definition, the kilogram would be defined as the mass of a specific, fixed number of silicon-28 atoms (e.g., 2.15x10^25 atoms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This means the definition would no longer rely on a physical object, but on a fundamental concept, ensuring it remains unaffected even if the physical spheres were lost or damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. There is a high likelihood that this approach will be adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

## The Watt Balance Method

Another significant approach to redefining the kilogram involves fixing Planck's constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. This is achieved using a device called a Watt Balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. The Watt Balance method is currently considered the frontrunner for redefining the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

## Complementary Approaches and Future Outlook

These two approaches—the silicon sphere (fixing Avogadro's constant) and the Watt Balance (fixing Planck's constant)—are complementary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. Each method serves as a check on the other, providing mutual verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. If both approaches show good agreement and can reduce their uncertainties to approximately 20 micrograms, the kilogram could be redefined as early as 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. This would finally establish the kilogram as an unchanging unit, free from dependence on a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

Historically, the initial definition of the kilogram in 1793, called the 'grave', was the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting temperature of ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The concept of using silicon as an element was conceived by Antoine Lavoisier in 1787, demonstrating his long-standing involvement in the definition of the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. The accuracy of the original kilogram artifact, created 214 years ago, was remarkable, being correct within the margin of error of a grain of rice compared to the mass of a liter of water at its densest temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

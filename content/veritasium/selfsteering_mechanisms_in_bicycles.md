Most people do not fully understand [[how_bicycles_work | how bicycles work]] and how they maintain balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While riders use steering to balance a bike, bikes are also designed to steer themselves, allowing them to remain upright even without a rider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Rider's Role in Steering and Balance

When riding a bicycle, steering is crucial not only for changing direction but also for maintaining balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Countersteering
To turn a bike, a rider must first [[countersteering_in_bicycles | counter-steer]] in the opposite direction of the desired turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, to turn right, one first counter-steers left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This action causes the rider to lean into the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This technique is often intuitive for riders but not explicitly known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

This concept is similar to balancing an inverted pendulum, like a broomstick on one's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. To move the pendulum in a certain direction, the base must first move in the opposite direction to initiate a lean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Similarly, on a unicycle, longitudinal balance is maintained by pedaling, and lateral balance is achieved through small counter-steer adjustments to position the wheel's contact patch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Balance while Riding
Even when riding in a straight line, a cyclist constantly makes minor steering adjustments to keep the bike underneath them and maintain balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This is why balancing on a stationary bike is difficult: steering is ineffective when stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Similarly, a bike with locked steering is nearly impossible to balance, even when moving, because the rider cannot steer the bike back under themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Mechanisms for Self-Steering and Stability

Bicycles can remain stable and upright without a rider if moving at a sufficient speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This stability is due to the bike's design, which allows it to steer itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. If a bike begins to lean to one side, the handlebars automatically turn in that direction, steering the wheels back underneath it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

At least three primary mechanisms contribute to a bicycle's corrective steering:

### 1. Caster Effect (Front Fork Angle)
Due to the angle of the front fork, the steering axis of a bicycle intersects the ground ahead of where the front wheel touches the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This design makes the front wheel act like a caster wheel found on shopping carts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   If the bike leans left, the ground force on the tire turns the wheel left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   If the bike leans right, the ground force turns the wheel right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
This steering action brings the bike back upright.

### 2. Mass Distribution of Handlebars and Front Wheel
The center of mass of the handlebars and front wheel assembly is positioned slightly in front of the steering axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   When the bike leans left, the weight of this assembly pushes the front wheel to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   When the bike leans right, their weight steers the front wheel to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
This self-correction helps maintain stability.

### 3. [[Gyroscopic effect and bike stability | Gyroscopic Effect]] (Indirect Steering Aid)
While commonly believed to be the primary reason for stability, the [[Gyroscopic effect and bike stability | gyroscopic effect]] of the spinning wheels does not directly keep the bike upright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Instead, it contributes to stability by helping to steer the bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   If the bike leans left, the spinning front wheel (acting as a gyroscope) will turn left due to gyroscopic precession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   If the bike leans right, it will turn right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
This effect helps the bike steer into a fall, bringing it back to balance.

## Ongoing Research

It is possible to create a stable bicycle without all three mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Researchers have developed bicycles that are stable purely through mass distribution, even without a gyroscopic effect (using counter-rotating wheels) or a caster effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. [[Bicycle balance and steering mechanisms | Understanding how bicycles work]] remains an active area of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, leading to advancements such as smart motors in handlebars that actively aid steering to maintain stability at low speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

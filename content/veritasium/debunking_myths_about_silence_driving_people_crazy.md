The quietest place on Earth is reportedly an [[anechoic_chambers_and_their_effects_on_the_human_mind | anechoic chamber]] in Minneapolis, with others existing, such as one at BYU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The term "anechoic" comes from Latin, meaning "no echo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These chambers are designed to absorb sound, achieved through foam wedges on the walls and even the floor, where a spring floor allows for further absorption beneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Low-frequency sounds bounce and eventually get lost in the walls, while high frequencies are absorbed directly into the foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This design completely deadens echoes, a change noticeable by clapping while closing the chamber doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Myths Surrounding Anechoic Chambers

There are widespread reports that it is impossible to stay in an [[anechoic_chambers_and_their_effects_on_the_human_mind | anechoic chamber]] for a significant period without losing one's sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The purported record for staying inside is 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Specific claims include:
*   Feeling claustrophobic despite the air being the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   [[Psychological responses to extreme silence | Disorientation]], dizziness, and nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Experiencing oral hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   A violinist reportedly banged on the door to get out within seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### [[Theoretical analyses and misconceptions | Proposed Explanations]] for Alleged Effects

One explanation for the feeling of claustrophobia is the lack of reverberation, which normally signals to the ear that there is space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Without it, the space feels tiny, "like you could be in a coffin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Another theory suggests an [[Psychological responses to extreme silence | anxiety response]]: people are accustomed to ambient sounds, and their absence can lead to panic, stress, and potentially [[Psychological responses to extreme silence | hallucinations]] as the brain attempts to compensate for the missing stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Visitors are often warned about potential dizziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## [[Physical sensations and perceptions in silence | Sensory Amplification in Extreme Silence]]

Inside an [[anechoic_chambers_and_their_effects_on_the_human_mind | anechoic chamber]], the absence of external sound leads to an amplification of internal and subtle sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>:
*   **Clothing and Bodily Fluids** Initially, any rustle of clothing or movement of fluids in the mouth or throat becomes audible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Blood Flow** The longer one stays, the more one begins to hear the sound of blood flowing through the brain, described as a ringing or pulsing sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Heartbeat** Some people report hearing their heartbeat coming from their chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Physical Sensations** The subject of an experiment noted feeling more aware of his heart, each pulse radiating as a wave through his chest and head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. He also perceived a hiss in his ears, attributed to hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Later, he felt his body shake slightly with every heartbeat, like a device with a small motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Amplified Quiet Sounds** Small sounds, such as a burp, seemed amplified, indicating that the brain recalibrates to make quiet things much louder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. He noted sounds like rubbing his beard, rustling clothes, or swallowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## The Debunking Experiment

Challenging the 45-minute myth, one individual decided to undergo an experiment, aiming to stay in the [[anechoic_chambers_and_their_effects_on_the_human_mind | anechoic chamber]] with the lights off for as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Experience and Outcome
*   **Comfort and Duration** The subject felt quite comfortable and relaxed, describing the silence as "nice and quiet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. He reported feeling a low-pitched hum at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. He stayed for nearly an hour, well past the 45-minute "record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. He did not fall asleep and found the experience pleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **No Negative Effects** He experienced no dizziness, nausea, or [[Psychological responses to extreme silence | hallucinations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. He believed he could have stayed for five hours and gotten work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Conclusion** The experiment successfully provided [[the_importance_of_disconfirming_evidence | disconfirming evidence]] to the widely held belief that prolonged exposure to extreme silence in an anechoic chamber drives people crazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

While acknowledging that some individuals might find such situations, like pitch-black rooms or confined spaces, uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, the experiment's results suggest that the myth of losing sanity in an anechoic chamber is largely unfounded.

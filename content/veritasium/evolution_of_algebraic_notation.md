Mathematics initially served to quantify the world, including measuring land, predicting planetary motions, and tracking commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For millennia, mathematical concepts were primarily expressed through words and pictures rather than modern symbolic equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>. This reliance on geometry significantly influenced how problems were formulated and solved.

## Geometry as the Foundation

Ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Persians, approached mathematical problems with a strong connection to physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

### Quadratic Equations and "Completing the Square"

The solution to quadratic equations, which today is expressed as `ax² + bx + c = 0`, was derived using geometric methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>. For example, the equation `x² + 26x = 27` would be visualized as a square of side `x` (representing `x²`) and a rectangle of dimensions `26` by `x` (representing `26x`), with their combined areas summing to 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>. The solution involved manipulating these geometric shapes by "completing the square" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>.

### Avoidance of Negative Numbers

For thousands of years, mathematicians were "oblivious" to negative solutions because they dealt with real-world quantities like lengths, areas, and volumes, where negative values made no sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:25">[03:42:25]</a>. This aversion meant there wasn't a single universal quadratic equation, but rather six different versions arranged to ensure all coefficients remained positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:59">[04:17:59]</a>.

### Cubic Equations

This geometric approach also extended to cubic equations. In the 11th century, Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam identified 19 different cubic equations, always ensuring positive coefficients. He found numerical solutions by considering the intersections of shapes like hyperbolas and circles, but he did not achieve a general algebraic solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:13">[04:28:13]</a>. Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, published "Summa de Arithmetica" in 1494, which summarized all known mathematics in Renaissance Italy at the time. His conclusion was that a general solution to the cubic equation was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

## Transition to Symbolic Algebra

The pursuit of a general solution to the cubic equation became a pivotal moment in the [[development_of_solutions_to_cubic_equations|development of solutions to cubic equations]] and the [[history_of_imaginary_numbers|invention of imaginary numbers]], driving the shift from purely geometric reasoning to abstract algebraic notation.

### Early Algorithms and Poems

When [[development_of_solutions_to_cubic_equations|Tartaglia]] independently discovered a method to solve "depressed cubics" (cubic equations without an `x²` term), he summarized his method not as a set of equations, but as an algorithm presented in a poem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:26">[10:36:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:04">[10:47:04]</a>. This was because modern algebraic notation did not yet exist, and math problems were still traditionally described with words and drawings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:06">[10:45:06]</a>.

### Francois Viete and Modern Notation

The 1600s saw the emergence of modern mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:28">[17:21:28]</a>. [[contributions_of_renaissance_mathematicians|Francois Viete]] was instrumental in introducing the modern symbolic notation for algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:27">[17:25:27]</a>, effectively ending the millennia-long tradition of representing math problems through drawings and verbose descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:19">[17:30:19]</a>. With this, geometry ceased to be the sole source of mathematical truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:50">[17:35:50]</a>.

### Rene Descartes and Imaginary Numbers

[[contributions_of_renaissance_mathematicians|Rene Descartes]] made significant use of the square roots of negative numbers, which he popularized and famously termed "imaginary numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:53">[17:39:53]</a>. Though he recognized their utility, the name stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:48">[17:44:48]</a>.

### Euler and the Symbol `i`

Later, [[contributions_of_notable_mathematicians_to_perfect_numbers|Euler]] introduced the letter `i` to specifically represent the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:41">[17:50:41]</a>. When combined with regular numbers, these formed complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>.

The [[development_of_solutions_to_cubic_equations|cubic equation]] problem led to the invention of these new numbers and ultimately liberated algebra from its strict ties to geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:15">[17:59:15]</a>. This abandonment of tangible reality in mathematical representation allowed for a more powerful and complete system that could solve real-world problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:41">[18:05:41]</a>.

## Impact on Physics

The utility of imaginary numbers, and thus the algebraic notation representing them, extended far beyond solving cubic equations. In 1925, Erwin Schrödinger formulated the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental equation governing the behavior of quantum particles. Notably, the symbol `i` (the square root of negative one) is prominently featured within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:16">[18:37:16]</a>. This surprised physicists, including Schrödinger himself, who found the use of complex numbers "unpleasant" in a physical theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:08">[18:43:08]</a>. However, the presence of `i` enables the equation to describe wave-like phenomena correctly, as operations involving `i` correspond to rotations in the complex plane, which are essential for describing waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:46">[19:50:46]</a>. As physicist Freeman Dyson noted, the inclusion of the square root of minus one transformed it from a heat conduction equation into a wave equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:06">[21:13:06]</a>. This demonstrated that nature itself operates with complex numbers, not just real ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:03">[21:44:03]</a>.

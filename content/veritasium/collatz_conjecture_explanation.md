The Collatz Conjecture is considered the most dangerous problem in mathematics, with young mathematicians often warned not to spend their time on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite its simple premise, even the world's best mathematicians have been unable to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. As famous mathematician Paul Erdos stated, "Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## How the Collatz Conjecture Works

The conjecture involves applying two simple rules to any positive integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>:
1.  **If the number is odd**: Multiply it by three and add one (3N+1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
2.  **If the number is even**: Divide it by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

These rules are applied repeatedly to the result of each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Example: Starting with 7
Let's follow the sequence for the number seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>:
*   **7** (odd): (3 * 7) + 1 = 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   **22** (even): 22 / 2 = 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **11** (odd): (3 * 11) + 1 = 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   **34** (even): 34 / 2 = 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   **17** (odd): (3 * 17) + 1 = 52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   **52** (even): 52 / 2 = 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   **26** (even): 26 / 2 = 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   **13** (odd): (3 * 13) + 1 = 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   **40** (even): 40 / 2 = 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   **20** (even): 20 / 2 = 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   **10** (even): 10 / 2 = 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   **5** (odd): (3 * 5) + 1 = 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
*   **16** (even): 16 / 2 = 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   **8** (even): 8 / 2 = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   **4** (even): 4 / 2 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   **2** (even): 2 / 2 = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

Once the number reaches 1, applying the rules results in 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1, forming a loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This is known as the "four, two, one loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture states that every positive integer, when these rules are applied, will eventually end up in the four, two, one loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Names and Origin

This problem is commonly known as the Collatz Conjecture, named after German mathematician Luther Collatz, who may have first conceived it in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. However, it has many origin stories and is also known by several other names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>:
*   Ulam conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Kakutani's problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   Thwaites conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   Hasse's algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   The Syracuse problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Simply 3N+1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

## Characteristics of Collatz Sequences

The numbers generated by applying the 3x+1 rules are called **hailstone numbers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This name comes from their tendency to rise and fall, similar to hailstones in a thundercloud, before eventually falling to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The number of steps it takes for a sequence to reach one is called its **total stopping time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. For example, the number 26 takes 10 steps to reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. However, the number 27 climbs to 9,232 (higher than Mount Everest if numbers represent meters) before taking 111 steps to reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The paths that different numbers take can vary widely, even for numbers that are adjacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Mathematical Observations and Properties

### Apparent Randomness
The pattern observed in hailstone numbers appears to be randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. When a large number's sequence is graphed using a logarithm, it produces a wiggly graph with a downward trend, similar to the stock market on a bad day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This is because both are examples of **geometric Brownian motion**, where fluctuations are random if the linear trend is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. For 3x+1, the trend is generally downward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Benford's Law
Analyzing the leading digits of numbers in Collatz sequences reveals a stable pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. For example, across the first billion sequences, approximately 30% of numbers start with one, 17.5% with two, and the frequency decreases for higher digits, with fewer than 5% starting with nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:06:11]</a>. This distribution is known as **Benford's law**, which appears in various natural phenomena like populations, company values, and physical constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Benford's law is most applicable when numbers span several orders of magnitude, as they do in Collatz sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, it cannot definitively prove whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Statistical Shrinkage
Intuitively, it might seem strange that all numbers should end at one, given that odd numbers are more than tripled while even numbers are only halved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. However, every time an odd number is multiplied by three and one is added, the result is always an even number, requiring the next step to be division by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This means odd numbers are effectively increased by a factor of about 3/2 (neglecting the plus one for large numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Considering the path from one odd number to the next odd number:
*   50% of the time, dividing by two brings you back to an odd number.
*   25% of the time, you can divide by four.
*   12.5% of the time, you can divide by eight, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
When calculating the geometric mean, the average factor to get from one odd number to the next is 3/4, which is less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Statistically, this implies that 3x+1 sequences are more likely to shrink than grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. For example, 341 reaches 1,024, which can be divided by two ten consecutive times to reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Visualizing Collatz Sequences

The sequences can be visualized as a **directed graph**, showing how each number connects to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This graph resembles a tree or streams flowing into each other, with the conjecture implying that all numbers ultimately flow into the "massive river of four, two, one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Another visualization involves rotating the graph at each number: anticlockwise for odd numbers and clockwise for even numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This creates intricate, organic-looking shapes resembling coral or seaweed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Potential Challenges to the Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture could be false in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>:
1.  **Infinite Growth**: A number might start a sequence that grows indefinitely, never falling back to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
2.  **Undiscovered Loop**: A sequence might form a closed loop other than the four, two, one loop, and be unconnected to the main graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

As of now, no such infinite sequence or alternative loop has been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Negative Numbers
Interestingly, if the 3x+1 rules are applied to negative numbers, there are not one, but three independent loops that exist:
*   The original `...4, 2, 1` loop (for positive integers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>
*   A loop including `-17` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>
*   A loop including `-5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>

This raises the question of why disconnected loops exist on the negative side of the number line but not on the positive side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## Current State of Research

### Brute Force Testing
Mathematicians have tested every single number by brute force up to 2^68 (approximately 295 quintillion numbers), and all of them have eventually come back down to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Based on this, any loop other than four, two, one would have to be at least 186 billion numbers long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. While this makes the conjecture seem highly probable, it does not constitute a formal mathematical proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### "Almost All Numbers" Proofs
One approach to proving the conjecture involves showing that every 3x+1 sequence eventually reaches a number smaller than its original seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   In 1976, Riho Terras demonstrated that [[strategies_and_challenges_in_solving_collatz_conjecture | almost all Collatz sequences]] reach a point below their initial value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   Subsequent work in 1979 and 1994 further reduced this limit, showing numbers go below `X` to the power of 0.869 and then 0.7925, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. "Almost all numbers" here means that as the numbers considered go to infinity, the fraction that falls under the curve approaches one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   In 2019, [[mathematicians_perspectives_on_collatz_conjecture | Terry Tao]], one of the world's greatest living mathematicians, showed that [[strategies_and_challenges_in_solving_collatz_conjecture | almost all numbers]] will end up smaller than any arbitrarily slow-growing function `f(x)` (e.g., log x or log, log, log x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. As Tao himself stated in 2020, this is "about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture without actually solving it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. However, this is still not a full proof.

### The Problem of Undecidability
The possibility exists that the Collatz Conjecture is **undecidable**, meaning it can never be proven true or false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. In 1987, John Conway created a generalization of 3x+1 called FRACTRAN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. He proved FRACTRAN is Turing-complete, capable of doing anything a modern computer can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This also means it's subject to the halting problem, where the machine might never stop running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. While this doesn't directly prove 3x+1 is undecidable, it suggests the possibility that a definitive proof might be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

## Why is it So Hard?

The difficulty in solving the Collatz Conjecture stems from several factors:
*   **Vast Search Space**: The numbers tested (up to 2^68) are minuscule compared to the scale of all numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. For comparison, the Polya conjecture (proposed in 1919) was disproven in 1958 by a counterexample that was 1.845 x 10^361, vastly larger than any number checked for Collatz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **Unpredictable Behavior**: While it's easy to calculate a number that will exhibit arbitrary finite behavior (e.g., increase five consecutive times), there's no control over its subsequent path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Lack of Obvious Counterexamples**: If a [[potential_evidence_and_counterexamples_for_collatz_conjecture | counterexample]] exists, it's virtually impossible to guess it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on Proof**: Most mathematicians try to prove the conjecture true, meaning few are actively looking for counterexamples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This contrasts with experiences where attempts to prove something false lead to discovering the correct statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

Despite its simple rules, the Collatz Conjecture reveals the peculiar and intractable nature of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. It remains an [[oldest_unsolved_problem_in_mathematics | unsolved problem]] that highlights the profound challenges in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

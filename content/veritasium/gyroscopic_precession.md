From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

[[Gyroscopic precession | Gyroscopic precession]] is a phenomenon observed in spinning objects where an applied torque, instead of causing the object to tip over as expected, causes it to precess or rotate around another axis. This effect can make heavy spinning objects behave in counter-intuitive ways, appearing much lighter or more stable than they are when stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Demonstrations

### The Apparatus

An impressive apparatus was constructed by the mechanical engineering shop at the University of Sydney for demonstrating [[Gyroscopic precession | gyroscopic precession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It consists of a 40-pound (19 kilogram) [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] attached to the end of a meter-long shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Horizontal Hold Experiment

When the 40-pound [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] is not spinning, it is virtually impossible for a person to hold the meter-long shaft horizontally with just one hand at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

However, once the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] is spun up to a few thousand revolutions per minute (RPM), it becomes possible to hold the shaft horizontally with a single hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The shaft remains horizontal and the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] appears "weightless" as it moves in a circular path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Overhead Lift Experiment

Without the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] spinning, lifting the apparatus over one's head with a single hand is extremely difficult and awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

When the 40-pound (19 kg) [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] is spinning at its maximum speed, lifting it over the head with one hand feels "incredibly light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It feels as though the apparatus is "wanting to go up by itself," requiring significantly less force than its actual [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | weight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. However, it's important to note that the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] is *not* truly weightless; if released, it would still fall to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## The Physics Explained

The phenomenon observed is [[Gyroscopic precession | gyroscopic precession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Instead of the [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | weight of the wheel]] pulling it straight down as expected, the [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | weight of the wheel creates a torque]] that causes it to push around in a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Weight Measurement Prediction

To further explore this, an experiment was set up using a scale. The person's [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | weight]] alone was approximately 72 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. When holding the non-spinning [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]], the total [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | weight]] measured on the scale was about 91 kilograms, which makes sense as the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] itself is approximately 19 kilograms (42 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

A prediction was solicited: when lifting the *spinning* [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] over the head while standing on the scale, would the scale reading be more than, less than, or equal to 91 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

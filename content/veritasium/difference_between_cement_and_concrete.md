While often used interchangeably, cement and concrete are distinct materials with different properties and applications. Understanding their relationship is key to comprehending modern construction.

## What is Cement?
Cement is the "glue" or "matrix" component of concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It is the most important man-made substance on Earth, with more of it used annually than any other substance apart from water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Approximately 500 kilograms of cement are produced each year for every person on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. In terms of solid products, cementitious material, essentially cement, is used as much as all other materials combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## What is Concrete?
Concrete is a composite material made by mixing cement with aggregate, which includes gravel and sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The annual amount of cement produced globally is enough to make two cubic meters of concrete per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Concrete is often described as "liquid rock" because it can be poured into any shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. It is valued for its strength, durability, and inexpensive production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Historical Development of Cement and Concrete

### Primitive Cement
Early forms of cement were produced by heating limestone, which is primarily calcium carbonate, to about 1,000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This process drives off CO2, leaving calcium oxide, also known as quicklime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. When quicklime is ground and mixed with water, an exothermic reaction occurs, forming calcium hydroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This mixture could be poured into molds and would harden over time by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, turning back into calcium carbonate as water evaporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. However, this primitive cement had drawbacks, including the inability for CO2 to penetrate large molds to harden the material, and its failure to set underwater due to the absence of CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### [[historical_development_of_concrete | Roman Concrete]]
The Romans discovered a solution to these limitations by adding volcanic ash, called pozzolana, to crushed limestone before heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This [[roman_concrete_versus_modern_concrete | Roman cement]] was significantly stronger and more durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. It enabled them to build structures like the Pantheon, the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome that has stood for 2,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, and concrete piers that hardened underwater and are still standing today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The recipe for [[roman_concrete_versus_modern_concrete | Roman concrete]] was lost for centuries until its rediscovery in a Swiss monastery in the 1400s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Portland Cement
Nearly 2,000 years after the Romans, it was discovered that adding clay or shale to limestone before crushing and heating produced a similar effect to pozzolana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This is because these materials contain silica, which fundamentally changes the [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | chemistry of cement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. With silica, cement does not need to dry to harden; instead, water becomes an integral part of the hardened concrete, allowing it to achieve maximum strength when setting underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Today, virtually all concrete is made with a cement formulation discovered in the 1840s, known as Portland cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This cement is made by crushing limestone and mixing it with a percentage of shale or clay for silicates, then grinding it into a fine powder and heating it to very high temperatures in a kiln <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The resulting hard nodules are called clinker, which were once considered waste but produce a superior cement when ground down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The most common compound in Portland cement is tricalcium silicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Concrete Production and Properties

### Aggregates
The aggregates (sand and gravel) are blasted from quarries, then ground to specific sizes and shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Strict requirements for aggregate size and shape ensure the resulting concrete's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Well-rounded, spherical sand particles, like river sand, are preferred for better finishability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Lightweight aggregates can be incorporated to reduce the weight of concrete, such as for elevated decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Typical concrete weighs around 150 pounds per cubic foot, while lightweight concrete can be about 110 pounds per cubic foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Mixing and Testing
At a concrete plant, aggregates are weighed out and loaded into mixer trucks along with cement and water according to precise recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Chemical admixtures like superplasticizers are added to adjust consistency, making the concrete easier to work with without significantly altering water content, which could affect strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. The consistency is checked using a "slump test" or "spread test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

Concrete suppliers cast sample cylinders from the mix on job sites to test its strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. These samples are cured in a 100% humidity environment, often submerged in a lime bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Strength increases over time, with tests typically conducted at 7, 14, and 28 days when concrete is considered to have reached full strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Samples are placed in a hydraulic press and pressure is increased until they fail, which can shake the testing room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The strongest concrete in competition has exceeded 100,000 psi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

While pure cement contains the most "glue," adding aggregates (sand and gravel) to the mix does not significantly reduce the ultimate compressive strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. All tested cylinders (pure cement, cement + sand, cement + sand + gravel) broke at similar pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. However, pure cement tends to flake and chip more under load, indicating that aggregates help the material cohere and stay together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Since cement is the most expensive component, reducing its percentage in the mix while maintaining strength is economically beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Hardening Process: Cement Hydration
Concrete hardens through a [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | chemistry]] called cement hydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. When water is added to the dry mixture of aggregates and cement powder, ions (including calcium hydroxide) from the dissolved cement grains enter the solution, making it very basic with a pH of up to 12 or 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. As tricalcium silicate reacts with water, calcium silicate hydrates and other hydrate minerals form interlocking crystals, causing the concrete to harden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. The water is essential for crystal formation and becomes part of the solid material, rather than simply evaporating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This is why freshly poured concrete should be kept damp, often through misting in dry environments like Las Vegas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

A common concrete mix will typically harden within about four hours without agitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. This is why concrete truck drums continuously turn to keep the mixture agitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. In emergencies, such as a truck breaking down, adding regular soda like Coke can prevent the setting process for a few hours due to the sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## [[roman_concrete_versus_modern_concrete | Roman Concrete]] vs. [[roman_concrete_versus_modern_concrete | Modern Concrete]]
While modern concrete is generally preferred for its cost-effectiveness, [[roman_concrete_versus_modern_concrete | Roman concrete]] possessed some unique advantages. It was less well-mixed, leaving undissolved calcium oxide blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. When cracks formed and water entered, the calcium oxide would dissolve to form calcium hydroxide, leading to new growth of calcium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. This property made [[roman_concrete_versus_modern_concrete | Roman concrete]] "self-healing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. However, assessing the overall superiority of [[roman_concrete_versus_modern_concrete | Roman concrete]] is subject to "survivor bias," as only the structures that have lasted for millennia are observed today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Modern concrete could be made to last longer, but it is often not deemed cost-effective given that buildings are not expected to last for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## Environmental Impact of Concrete
Concrete is essential for large-scale infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. However, its production, particularly cement, contributes significantly to global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, estimated at 8% of the global total, which is more than the entire aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. Efforts to reduce this [[environmental_impact_and_carbon_footprint_of_concrete_production | environmental impact]] are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

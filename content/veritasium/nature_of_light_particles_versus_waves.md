The fundamental question of "What is light?" has puzzled scientists for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. While common perceptions include light as brightness or a means to see things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, its true nature has been a subject of intense scientific [[historical_debate_on_the_nature_of_light | debate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Historical Theories of Light

In the late 1600s, two prominent theories emerged regarding the nature of light:
*   **Particle Theory (Corpuscular Theory)**: Proposed by Isaac Newton in his treatise *Opticks*, this theory suggested that light was composed of a stream of particles or corpuscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Wave Theory**: At the same time, Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens posited that light behaved as a [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

This [[historical_debate_on_the_nature_of_light | debate]] continued for over a century until an experiment provided compelling evidence to settle the matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Young's Double-Slit Experiment

The pivotal experiment that shed light on the nature of light was Thomas Young's double-slit experiment, performed in 1803 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Young's original handwritten notes from the Royal Society in London describe his observations: "Besides the fringes of color on each side of the shadow, the shadow itself was divided by similar parallel fringes, of smaller dimensions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Experiment Setup
A simplified recreation of the experiment involves:
1.  An empty box with an eyepiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
2.  A small hole at the top where a slide with two very narrow, side-by-side openings (a "double slit") is placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
3.  The box is tilted so that sunlight directly hits the double slit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Expected vs. Observed Results

Prior to viewing the results, many would intuitively expect to see two bright lines or broad-bands on the bottom of the box, corresponding to the two slits, if light were composed of particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

However, the observed pattern is strikingly different:
*   Instead of two lines, multiple dots or fringes are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   There is a strong, bright, white spot in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   On either side of the central spot, there are multicolored dots or fringes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   More dots appear, spreading out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

This observed pattern is confusing if one assumes light is made of particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, but it is exactly what would be expected if light behaves as a [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Light as a Wave: The Role of Interference

The explanation for the observed pattern lies in the principle of [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | interference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. When light passes through two narrow slits, the [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] from one slit interacts with the [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] from the other slit.

This phenomenon can be visualized using water [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]]:
*   If a single source creates ripples in a pond, they travel outwards in circular wavefronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   If a second source of ripples is added, an interesting pattern emerges where the ripples from both sources interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

This interaction leads to two types of [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | interference]]:
*   **Constructive [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | Interference]]**: Occurs when the peaks of two [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] meet peaks, or troughs meet troughs. This increases the amplitude of the [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]], resulting in a bright spot of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Destructive [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | Interference]]**: Occurs when the peak of one [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] meets the trough of another [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]]. The [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] cancel each other out, resulting in no light or a dark spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

This interaction produces the observed pattern of alternating bright and dark spots in the double-slit experiment, where light effectively cancels itself out in certain areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Color and Wavelengths

Sunlight is a composite of many different colors, each corresponding to a different [[wave_physics_and_properties | wavelength]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Because different [[wave_physics_and_properties | wavelengths]] interfere at slightly different points, the [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | interference]] pattern for each color is slightly offset. This is why the fringes observed further from the central maximum exhibit a rainbow effect, with reds and blues meeting up at different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Therefore, the difference in color we perceive is simply due to different [[wave_physics_and_properties | wavelengths]] of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

The results of Young's double-slit experiment were so convincing that the scientific community concluded that light must be a [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

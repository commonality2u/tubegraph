The term "IQ" is prevalent in popular culture, often understood as an objective and rigorous measurement of intellectual ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. However, the accuracy and nature of what IQ tests truly measure have been subject to significant debate and evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Flynn Effect: A Changing Landscape of IQ Scores

Average IQ scores of populations have shown a consistent increase over the past century, a phenomenon known as the [[what_iq_tests_actually_measure | Flynn Effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Researcher James Flynn studied average results of IQ tests over the last century, noting that each time tests were updated and re-normalized to maintain an average of 100, scores had to be shifted down by approximately two to three IQ points per decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. This implies that if re-normalization didn't occur, the average IQ of the global population would appear to have increased by about 30 points over a hundred years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

This observation raises questions about the definition of intelligence itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Since the genetics of the population have not changed significantly over a century, environmental and cultural factors are implicated in this rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

### Causes of the Flynn Effect

Several factors are proposed to explain the [[what_iq_tests_actually_measure | Flynn Effect]]:
*   **Improving Nutrition and Health** Improving childhood nutrition and general health are believed to be contributing factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Height has also increased over the same period, suggesting broader improvements in living conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
*   **Better Education** There is substantial evidence that schooling increases intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Increased knowledge facilitates problem-solving by providing more associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.
*   **Shift in Work Types** A transition from predominantly manual labor a century ago to more abstract thinking in modern jobs may have enhanced abilities needed for IQ tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

## Cultural Influence on IQ Measurement

IQ tests, despite their aim to objectively measure intelligence, are significantly influenced by cultural contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. The fact that cultural changes over time within the same country affect average IQ scores suggests that cultural differences between groups at the same time could have similar effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

Some tests claim to be "culture fair," designed to be equally valid across all cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. However, experts argue that a truly culture-free test is impossible to construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. These tests often assess visual relations, geometric shapes, and patterns, overlooking that cultures differ in their vocabulary for shapes or spatial relations, which influences how people categorize and think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. For example, cultures without printed materials may not perceive visual patterns in the same way as those with a history of literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

Moreover, "culture fair" tests often do not assess forms of intelligence vital for survival in other cultures, such as ethnobotanical knowledge, training dogs for hunting, or surviving alone in a rainforest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. Because these forms of intelligence are less common or measurable within the dominant culture, IQ puzzles have become the definitive, albeit culturally biased, method to quantify intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

## Beyond the "g-factor": Other Influences on IQ Scores

While [[history_of_iq_tests | early researchers]] like Charles Spearman believed the general intelligence factor (g-factor) was fixed and inherited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, later understanding, partly fueled by the [[what_iq_tests_actually_measure | Flynn Effect]], indicates that IQ is not entirely determined by genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Estimates suggest a roughly 50/50 split between heritability and environment over a lifespan, with some literature suggesting a range of 40% to 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

Beyond genetics and broad societal changes, several individual factors also influence IQ test scores:

*   **Motivation** The level of incentive to complete an IQ test can significantly impact scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. Studies show that financial motivation can increase IQ scores by up to 20 points, with the largest effect observed in individuals with below-average IQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. This suggests that IQ tests also measure motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.
*   **Training and Coaching** Familiarizing oneself with IQ-style questions and specific test components can boost scores by up to eight points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. The video's host found that practicing different question types made the math section particularly easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Test-Taking Strategy** Skills like knowing when to skip questions, eliminating incorrect answers, and guessing are important for optimal performance under time pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. The host noted that the time limits were the hardest aspect of the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.
*   **Anxiety** While a small amount of anxiety can be beneficial, excessive anxiety can negatively impact performance on IQ tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

## The Complexities of IQ Testing

The [[controversies_and_criticisms_of_iq_tests | history of IQ testing]] includes [[history_of_iq_tests | its misuse]] to promote eugenics and racial differences in intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. However, rejecting IQ tests entirely is also an extreme view, as they offer certain benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.

The initial intention behind tests like the Binet-Simon test was to identify students needing more help, with the belief that intelligence could be improved through education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. When used as an objective measure, IQ tests can identify individuals with strong intellectual abilities who might otherwise be overlooked, especially those from poorer or minority backgrounds who might not be identified by teacher recommendations alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. This can help overcome social biases in school admissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

Ultimately, while IQ tests offer some [[predictive_power_of_iq | predictive power]] for various life outcomes, including school success, job performance, and longevity, they do not solely measure an individual's innate intellectual capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. They are influenced by a multitude of factors, including education, motivation, and cultural context. The ongoing debate around IQ testing highlights the complexity of measuring human intelligence and the importance of considering multiple perspectives in [[science_communication_and_education | science communication and education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. What's most important is not an IQ score, but how individuals interact with and help others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

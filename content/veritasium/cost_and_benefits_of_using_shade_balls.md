Shade balls are small, black, partially water-filled spheres used to cover open water reservoirs, particularly in places like Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While often misunderstood as primarily for evaporation reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, their main purpose is to address specific water quality issues and provide various other benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. The LA Reservoir alone uses 96 million [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Primary Benefit: Preventing Bromate Formation

The primary reason for deploying [[purpose_and_function_of_shade_balls | shade balls]] in the Los Angeles Reservoir was to prevent the formation of Bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **The Problem**: Bromide is a naturally occurring, harmless substance found in water, especially from sources like the California Aqueduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. While harmless on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, when Bromide combines with Chlorine (a necessary disinfectant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a> under bright sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, it forms Bromate, which is carcinogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This discovery was made when a beverage company customer found high Bromate levels in water from the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **The Solution**: With Bromide and Chlorine being unavoidable, the only choice was to remove sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. After considering various options like floating tarps or pipe debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] (originally called "bird balls") were identified as an effective solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   **Testing**: Initial tests using kiddie pools showed that [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] immediately solved the Bromate problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   **Color**: [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | Shade balls are black]] to block all light from reaching the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This color is achieved using "carbon black" pigment, which ensures the plastic's stability and longevity (at least 10 years) when exposed to sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Other colors tested were unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

## Additional Benefits

Beyond Bromate prevention, [[purpose_and_function_of_shade_balls | shade balls]] offer several other advantages:

*   **Algae Control**: Blocking sunlight eliminates algae growth in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. This significantly reduces the need for Chlorine, which was previously used extensively to control algae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
*   **Evaporation Reduction**: Despite their black color, [[the_science_behind_shade_balls_in_water | shade balls reduce evaporation]] by 80 to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. This occurs because:
    *   They reduce the exposed surface area of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
    *   They prevent dry air from continually replacing moist air directly above the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
    *   The balls are partially filled with air, which acts as a thermal insulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>, preventing heat from the sun-heated top of the ball from transferring to the water below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. In fact, the water under the [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] is actually cooler than an uncovered reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
*   **Bird Deterrent**: Originally known as "bird balls," they effectively deter waterfowl from landing on the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This is beneficial for preventing bird droppings from impacting water quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a> and also prevents birds from getting poisoned by contaminated ponds or interfering with aircraft near airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Costs and Savings

[[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | Shade balls]] are relatively inexpensive.
*   **Purchase Cost**: They cost approximately 33-34 cents per ball, or about three for one dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
*   **Material and Safety**: They are made from high-density polyethylene, the same food-grade plastic used for milk jugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. The material is safe for drinking water contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a> and inert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term Value**: Over their lifespan, the savings from reduced chlorination chemicals and evaporation are expected to cover at least half of the balls' cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. Additionally, they have a salvage value as they are recyclable material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. The water quality benefit is considered immeasurable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

## Design and Handling

*   **Weighting**: [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | Shade balls]] are partially filled with water to prevent them from being blown away by high winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The uneven water distribution makes them wobble if they do roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Movement**: Moving through [[swimming_in_shade_balls | shade balls]] (e.g., by boat) is very difficult because they form dense, "close packed crystal-like structures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, making it feel like driving through peanut butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Despite breezes, they remain very stable on the water's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.
*   **Shape**: The spherical shape is crucial because it prevents them from stacking up or perching on the reservoir banks as water levels fluctuate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>, ensuring they spread out to cover the water effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. Other shapes like hexagons were considered but were not suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

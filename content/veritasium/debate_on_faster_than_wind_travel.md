From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The concept of a wind-powered vehicle traveling directly downwind faster than the wind itself has been the subject of an intense [[physics_of_windpowered_vehicles | physics debate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This idea is counterintuitive, leading many to believe it would violate the law of conservation of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Brain Teaser

The debate stems from a simple question: Can any wind-powered vehicle go directly downwind faster than the wind itself? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>

### Why Sailboats Cannot

*   **Directly Downwind:** A sailboat traveling directly downwind can only match the speed of the wind, never exceed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Once the sailboat reaches the same speed as the wind, there is no longer any apparent wind moving over the sail, as both the air and the boat are moving together at the same speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Without apparent wind, the sail cannot be pushed further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Tacking at an Angle:** However, sailboats can go faster than the wind if they travel at an angle to the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. In this scenario, the sail acts like a wing, generating lift (a force perpendicular to the apparent wind) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. A component of this lift force pushes the boat forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Some boats can reach speeds three or four times that of the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. It's been established that by tacking, a sailboat can achieve a "velocity made good" directly downwind that is faster than the wind itself, meaning it can beat a balloon drifting on the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## Blackbird: The Propeller Craft

The Blackbird is a one-of-a-kind propeller craft, designed and built by Rick (its inventor) and owned by Neil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Its purpose was to experimentally prove that a vehicle could go directly downwind faster than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

The craft was tested at El Mirage, a dry lakebed a few hours from Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. The vehicle itself is described as "makeshift" and "unbalanced," raising safety concerns during operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

### How Blackbird Works

Unlike a sailboat, Blackbird's propeller does not act like a windmill pushed by the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. Instead, the wind initially pushes the craft forward, causing its wheels to turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. These wheels are geared to the propeller in such a way that they spin it in the *opposite* direction to the wind's push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. This causes the propeller to operate like a fan, pushing air *backwards* and providing thrust that drives the craft forwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

### The Physics Explained

The key to Blackbird's operation lies in the difference between the vehicle's speed over the ground and its speed through the air due to the tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>.

*   **Propeller as a Fan:** Even if the vehicle is moving at the speed of the wind, there is no relative air motion over the cart, but the propeller can still "hit" air molecules and push them backwards, generating thrust, similar to a fan operating in still air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.
*   **Energy Transfer:** The energy to power the fan comes from the wind itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. The propeller extracts kinetic energy from the wind, slowing down the air directly behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. For example, if the surrounding wind is 10 km/h, the air behind the propeller might be slowed to 8 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>. This extracted energy is then converted into the kinetic energy of the vehicle, allowing it to accelerate and move faster than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>.

### Experimental Proof

Initially, the inventor built a small model that successfully operated on a treadmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. This treadmill demonstration was meant to settle the debate, but internet users and even physics professors were skeptical, claiming it was fake or that the treadmill wasn't a good real-world analog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Despite the principle of inertial frames being fundamental to [[physics_of_windpowered_vehicles | physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>, the online community insisted on hidden magnets, wires, or fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This led to the decision to build the full-scale Blackbird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

During testing, the telltale (a string at the front of Blackbird) showed the vehicle reaching and then exceeding wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. When the vehicle matched wind speed, the telltale would dangle straight down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. When it exceeded wind speed, the telltale flipped around to point straight back at the driver, indicating an apparent headwind, even though the true wind was coming from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.

The Blackbird successfully reached a record speed of 2.8 times the wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>, physically demonstrating the possibility of a vehicle traveling downwind faster than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>.

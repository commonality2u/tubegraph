Maintaining human health during prolonged space travel, such as a journey to Mars, presents significant [[space_exploration_challenges | challenges]] due to the unique [[challenges_of_microgravity_in_space_travel | microgravity environment]] and [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation exposure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Astronauts on Earth would experience a 30-second microgravity simulation in a plane, but a real trip to Mars would involve eight months of microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

## Effects of Low Gravity on the Body

The [[effects_of_microgravity_on_the_human_body | human body]] is evolved for Earth's gravity of 9.8 m/sÂ² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. In low-gravity or microgravity conditions, several physiological changes occur:

*   **Muscle Atrophy**
    *   Exercise becomes difficult; lifting an arm, which is a workout on Earth, provides no benefit in microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
    *   Muscles weaken and shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
    *   Muscle mass can decrease by up to 20% in space flights lasting just 5 to 11 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

*   **Bone Density Loss**
    *   The absence of weight pushing on bones leads to a decrease in bone density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
    *   Astronauts can lose one to two percent of bone mass per month, primarily in their lower extremities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
    *   This rate of bone loss is over 10 times faster than what people on Earth experience through osteoporosis as they age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

*   **Other Challenges**
    *   Everyday activities become more challenging; for instance, the surface tension of water becomes significant, making tasks like washing one's face, showering, brushing teeth, and using the bathroom much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
    *   Nausea is a major challenge, as human bodies are not evolved for different gravity situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Health Maintenance

Despite these [[space_exploration_challenges | difficulties]], they are seen as solvable challenges rather than deal-breakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Exercise Regimen

*   **Necessity**: Due to muscle atrophy, regular exercise is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   **Method**: Traditional weightlifting is ineffective in microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Instead, astronauts rely on elastic resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Example**: On the International Space Station, astronauts are elastically tethered to a treadmill and typically exercise two and a half hours every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   **Mars Specific Solution**: On Mars, where gravity is about 37% of Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, wearing a spacesuit that weighs 310 pounds on Earth would make an astronaut feel as heavy as they would on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This could help maintain muscle and bone mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

### Radiation Protection

*   **Shielding**: Protecting against [[radiation exposure during space travel | significant radiation exposure]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Materials**: Shielding can be integrated into the ship's insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Water is an excellent radiation absorber and can be used to shield the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   **Awareness**: [[Radiation hardening in space missions and electronics | Radiation]] cannot be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Astronauts have reported seeing flashes of light with their eyes closed, believed to be due to heavy particles or energy bursts from space radiation passing through the eyeball or optic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

Becoming a multiplanetary species is crucial for human long-term survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Future human evolution may take different directions if colonies are established on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

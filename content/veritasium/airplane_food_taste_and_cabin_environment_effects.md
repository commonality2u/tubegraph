Passengers often describe airplane food as bland or having a different consistency compared to food on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This perception of diminished taste is not solely the airlines' fault, as the unique cabin environment plays a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Cabin Environment Factors Affecting Taste

### Dry Air
The air pumped into the cabin at [[altitude_effects_on_airplane_efficiency_and_safety | cruising altitude]] is exceptionally dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. While the Sahara Desert has an average relative humidity of 25%, an airplane cabin can drop as low as 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This dryness can dehydrate nasal passages, which in turn hinders a person's sense of smell and, consequently, their sense of taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Lower Pressure
The lower cabin pressure can also reduce the intensity of sensations, particularly for salt and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. Airplane cabins are not fully pressurized to sea level pressure (101.3 kilopascals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. At [[altitude_effects_on_airplane_efficiency_and_safety | cruising altitude]], the pressure can drop to around 77 kilopascals, which maintains the oxygen partial pressure at the minimum required for human comfort (16 kilopascals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This partial pressurization is done to minimize stresses on the plane's fuselage and extend its lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Cabin Noise and Umami
Despite the general dulling of flavors, one taste appears to be enhanced in flight: umami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. A 2015 study suggests that loud cabin noise might unintentionally stimulate the chorda tympani, a nerve that carries taste information from the tongue to the brainstem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This nerve runs close to the eardrum, and its stimulation could create an "audio illusion" that boosts the perception of umami, the savory taste found in ingredients like MSG, soy sauce, and tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

This phenomenon may explain why tomato juice is a popular drink choice on flights, with a German survey finding that over a quarter of flyers order it, and 23% of those would never drink it on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Similarly, some passengers only drink Bloody Marys when flying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

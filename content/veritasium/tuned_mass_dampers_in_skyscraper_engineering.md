A tuned mass damper (TMD) is a system designed to reduce vibrations in structures. While previously used in bridges, power lines, and ships, the Citicorp Center was the first building to incorporate a TMD [07:50]. This innovative solution allowed architects to design taller and slimmer skyscrapers [07:52, 27:52, 27:54].

## How a Tuned Mass Damper Works

A TMD functions by absorbing and dissipating kinetic energy from the main structure [08:27, 08:32]. As a building sways, it transfers some of its kinetic energy to the TMD's mass, causing the mass to swing [08:27, 08:30]. This oscillation of the TMD occurs out of phase with the building's motion, with energy being dissipated through friction at a hinge or through separate viscous dampers [08:32, 08:35, 08:38, 10:13, 10:17, 10:21]. This process significantly damps the sway of the tower [08:45].

For a TMD to be effective, it needs to be carefully tuned [08:48].
*   The mass must be at least 1% to 5% of the building's weight [08:57, 09:00].
*   The frequency of the TMD is tuned by adjusting the length of its pendulum or the properties of its springs [09:02, 09:04].
*   The amount of damping is tuned by adjusting the friction in the system, for example, by loosening or tightening a bolt [09:12, 09:14, 09:16].

There are various types of TMDs, including pendulums, liquid columns, and large masses on springs [09:42, 09:44, 09:49].

## The Citicorp Center and its Tuned Mass Damper

The Citicorp Center, opened in 1977, was initially a lighter construction than most other buildings in New York, weighing 22 pounds per square foot [07:14, 07:18, 07:22, 07:24]. This light design made the building swayable in the wind, which, while not a structural problem, could have been uncomfortable for occupants [07:27, 07:31, 07:32, 07:36].

To address this, structural engineer Bill LeMessurier devised a more elegant solution than adding more steel: a [[tuned_mass_damper_in_skyscraper_engineering | tuned mass damper]] [07:41, 07:45, 07:47]. The Citicorp Center's TMD consisted of a 400-ton concrete mass, measuring 29 feet square and about eight feet thick, installed on the top floor [09:52, 09:54, 09:58, 10:01]. This mass, affectionately known as "that great block of cheese," was designed to oscillate out of phase with the building's motion, reducing the amplitude of swaying by roughly 50% [10:03, 10:07, 10:10, 10:21, 10:24, 10:26]. The inclusion of the TMD saved approximately $4 million by eliminating the need for an additional 2,800 tons of structural steel [10:29, 10:31, 10:32].

After a structural flaw was discovered in 1978, the TMD became critical to the tower's stability [20:45, 20:48, 20:51]. Emergency generators were acquired for the TMD to ensure it would remain operational even in the event of a power outage during a storm [18:57, 18:59, 20:42, 20:44].

## Global Impact and Legacy

The Citicorp Center's pioneering use of a TMD influenced skyscraper design worldwide [27:47, 27:49]. TMDs have been copied numerous times, particularly in Japan [28:03, 28:05]. Of the 20 tallest buildings globally, six incorporate a [[tuned_mass_damper_in_skyscraper_engineering | tuned mass damper]] [28:14, 28:16]. They are especially crucial in regions prone to typhoons or earthquakes [28:18]. For instance, Taipei 101 features a massive 660-ton pendulum TMD that stabilizes the building against winds up to 200 kilometers per hour and earthquakes over 6.8 magnitude [28:22, 28:26, 28:27, 28:31, 28:32].

The [[impact_of_the_citicorp_case_on_building_regulations_and_architecture | Citicorp case]] and the successful use of the TMD led to updates in the New York building code, requiring quartering wind calculations [27:42, 27:44, 27:45]. The story of the Citicorp Center and its TMD is now taught globally as a case study in good engineering ethics [27:23, 27:25, 27:27, 27:29].

Kinetic energy weapons, often colloquially known as "Rods from God," are a theoretical class of space weapon designed to deliver immense destructive power without using explosives. The concept relies on the sheer force of impact from a massive object traveling at hypersonic speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Origin and Concept: Project Thor

The idea for a space-based kinetic weapon originated in the late 1950s with Jerry Pournelle, a researcher at Boeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This was in response to the Soviet Union's successful test of the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in 1957, which could deliver a nuclear warhead to the US East Coast in about 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

Pournelle's concept, named "Project Thor" after the Norse god who threw lightning bolts, involved placing telephone-pole sized pieces of tungsten in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. These rods could be dropped on any target on Earth within a 15-minute window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

Key capabilities imagined for Project Thor included:
*   Striking any global location in 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   Destroying targets buried 30 meters underground, such as Soviet nuclear missile silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
*   Theoretically intercepting ICBMs mid-flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

The idea was seriously considered by the Reagan administration in the 1980s under the codename "Brilliant Pebbles" but was later abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. It was resurrected in 2003 by the Air Force Transformation Plan as "hypervelocity rod bundles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## Mechanism and Destructive Power

Kinetic energy is directly proportional to an object's mass and the square of its velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This means a tenfold increase in mass increases kinetic energy tenfold, but a tenfold increase in velocity increases kinetic energy a hundredfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

Rods from God, upon re-entry from orbit, would slow down due to atmospheric drag but would still be traveling around Mach 10 (approximately three kilometers per second) upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. A single tungsten rod of this type would possess kinetic energy equivalent to the largest conventional explosive ever detonated, the MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast), which released 11 tons of TNT equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

Impacts at such extreme speeds are explosive. The kinetic energy heats the ground, turning material into superheated liquid and gas that spray outwards in a symmetric explosion, similar to how impact craters on the moon are circular regardless of the asteroid's angle of entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. This allows the rods to penetrate about 30 meters of soil, making them effective against bunkers or silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
*   **Precision and Localization**: The explosive effect is localized, allowing for precise, surgical strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.
*   **No Radioactive Fallout**: Unlike [[ethical_implications_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]], there is no radioactive fallout, nor do they contravene international laws or treaties regarding weapons in space, which primarily prohibit nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Feasibility
Despite their theoretical power, real-world implementation of Rods from God faces significant challenges:

*   **Aiming**: Aiming an object traveling at hypersonic speeds is incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. Even with thrusters, adjustable fins, or changing the rod's center of mass, precision is a major hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>. The video's [[testing_and_experiments_with_kinetic_projectiles | experiments]] with dropping weights from a helicopter demonstrated how difficult it is to hit a target even from lower altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Communicating with the rod from the ground or space would be nearly impossible due to the superheated plasma surrounding it during re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.
*   **Orbital Mechanics**:
    *   **Geostationary Orbit**: Placing a rod in geostationary orbit (over 35,000 kilometers away) would mean it takes several hours to fall to Earth, negating the "15-minute strike" advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Low Earth Orbit**: In low Earth orbit (around 350 kilometers), a rod circles the Earth every 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>. Due to Earth's rotation and orbital drift, striking a target could take up to an hour and a half from the time a strike is ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>. Hundreds of satellites would be needed to ensure a rod is always near a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Launching a hundred such rods into space would cost billions of dollars, with ongoing maintenance costs for thrusters and other components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. A very limited missile defense system could cost around $300 billion, nearly half the US military's annual budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.
*   **Evasion**: Even with a system in place, enemies could evade defense by launching multiple missiles simultaneously, as there might only be one rod in the correct location at a given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>. Modern ICBMs also split into multiple payloads and decoys after their boost phase, complicating interception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>.

## Material and Shape
Tungsten is the preferred material for Rods from God due to two main reasons:
*   **Density**: Tungsten is extremely dense (19 tons per cubic meter), more than twice as dense as steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. This allows for maximum mass in a smaller volume, reducing atmospheric resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
*   **High Melting Point**: Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal (almost 3,500 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. This property is crucial because significant heat builds up around the rod as it decelerates through the atmosphere, minimizing the need for extensive shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.

The shape of the weapon is also critical; a sleek, aerodynamic rod shape is optimal to minimize drag and maintain maximum speed upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, Rods from God are considered unfeasible for real-world execution due to immense technical and financial hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. The concept remains largely within the realm of [[the_role_of_kinetic_weapons_in_science_fiction | science fiction]], appearing in numerous movies, video games, and books, such as Jerry Pournelle's 1985 novel *Footfall* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>.

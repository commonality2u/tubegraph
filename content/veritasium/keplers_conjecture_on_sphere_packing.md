Johannes Kepler, a renowned scientist who lived and worked in Prague, is famous for his contributions to astronomy and geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. His early work involved a model of the solar system where planets were on nested spheres separated by [[platonic_solids_in_geometry_and_astronomy | Platonic solids]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This attraction to geometry extended to practical questions, such as how to stack cannonballs most efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## The Conjecture
By 1611, Kepler had proposed a solution to the sphere packing problem: hexagonal close packing and the face-centered cubic arrangement are both equivalently and optimally efficient ways to stack spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. In these arrangements, the spheres occupy about 74% of the total volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. While this method is commonly seen, for example, in how oranges are stacked in a supermarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, Kepler stated it as a fact without providing a formal proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This unproven statement became known as Kepler's Conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Proof and Publication
It took approximately 400 years for Kepler's Conjecture to be formally proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The formal proof was finally published in 2017 in the *Journal of Mathematics* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Connection to Snowflakes
Kepler published his conjecture in a pamphlet titled *Deniva Sexangula*, or "On the Six-Cornered Snowflake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. In this work, he pondered why snowflakes invariably display a six-cornered shape, asking why they don't fall with five or seven corners instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Despite the absence of a theory of atoms or molecules in his day, Kepler was on the verge of understanding crystal self-arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. He speculated about the smallest natural unit of water—essentially a water molecule—and how these tiny units might stack mechanically to form a hexagonal crystal, similar to the hexagonal close-packed arrangement of cannonballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This demonstrated his intuition about the underlying geometric regularities in nature, even if the specific mechanisms were not yet understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | first-ever image of a black hole]], released by the [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] collaboration on April 10th, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, depicts plasma orbiting the supermassive [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] at the center of [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | galaxy M87]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Relativistic Beaming

The bright region in the image indicates where plasma is moving towards the observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Because this plasma is traveling at speeds close to the speed of light, it appears brighter when approaching and dimmer when moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This phenomenon is known as [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | relativistic beaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

[[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | Relativistic beaming]] is also the reason why only the jet pointing towards Earth is visible in a Hubble Space Telescope image, while the jet moving away is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Plasma Orbit Characteristics

From the image, scientists have determined that the plasma is orbiting clockwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It takes approximately 2 days for the plasma to complete one full orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Observation Wavelength

The [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] was observed using electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters, which are radio waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This specific part of the spectrum was chosen for imaging because it allows for the visualization of features very close to the [[photon_sphere_and_schild_radius | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> and can penetrate through the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] and interstellar dust to reach telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## M87 Black Hole Activity and Jets

The supermassive [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] in M87 is highly active, continuously consuming large amounts of matter from its glowing hot [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It also features narrow, collimated jets extending above and below it, depicted in blue in simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These jets are believed to be formed by incredibly strong magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The jets span at least 5,000 light-years, with one appearing to point almost directly towards Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

The warping of space-time around the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] enables light to be observed even from parts of the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] situated behind the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], which are gravitationally lensed above and below the shadow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

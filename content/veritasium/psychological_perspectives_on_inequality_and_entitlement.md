The COVID lockdown highlighted a striking disparity in perceptions: nearly half of men reported doing most of the homeschooling, while only three percent of women agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This phenomenon serves as a powerful illustration of [[egocentric_bias_and_selfattribution | egocentric bias]], a cognitive tendency where individuals believe they contribute more than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## [[egocentric_bias_and_selfattribution | Egocentric Bias]]

[[egocentric_bias_and_selfattribution | Egocentric bias]] manifests in various contexts:
*   Authors of multi-author papers, when asked what percentage of work they personally did, collectively sum up to an average of 140 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   Couples estimating their share of housework almost always total over 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Surprisingly, this bias isn't merely about wanting to appear helpful. When couples are asked about initiating arguments or contributing to mess, the combined total also exceeds 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This suggests that people not only think they do more work but also cause more problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The underlying reason for this bias is believed to be that individuals vividly experience and remember their own actions, but not fully those of others, leading to an overestimation of personal contributions and an underestimation of others' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The Unacknowledged Role of Luck

This [[egocentric_bias_and_selfattribution | bias]] often leads people to underestimate the influence of external factors, such as luck, on their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Examples of Luck's Influence

*   **Hockey Players:** Professional hockey players often credit their success to hard work, determination, great coaches, and parental support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. However, they rarely acknowledge the luck of their birth month. In many years, 40% of top-tier hockey players are born in the first quarter of the year, compared to only 10% in the fourth quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This disparity arises because the cutoff date for youth leagues is often January 1st, meaning players born early in the year are slightly older, bigger, and faster within their age group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. These initial advantages compound over time as promising young players receive more ice time, enter more tournaments, and get better coaching, leading to a significant skew by the time they reach professional levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Country of Birth:** One of the most significant fortunate circumstances is being born into a prosperous country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Approximately half of the variance in income received globally is explained by an individual's country of residence and its income distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. For example, a person born in Burundi, with a gross national income per capita of just $730 a year, is unlikely to earn much as an adult regardless of their intelligence or diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Track and Field Records:** While world-record-holding track and field athletes are undoubtedly talented and dedicated, seven out of eight such athletes achieved their records with a tailwindâ€”a stroke of luck that, combined with their skill, allowed them to set new benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **NASA Astronaut Selection:** In highly competitive fields, the importance of luck increases significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For the 2017 NASA astronaut class, only 11 were selected from over 18,300 applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. A model assuming selection based 95% on skill/experience and 5% on luck found that selected astronauts had an average luck score of 94.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. On average, only 1.6 of the 11 selected astronauts would have been in the top group based on skill alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This indicates that even a small percentage of luck can drastically change who succeeds when competition is fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Consequences of Overlooking Luck

People often get offended when the role of chance in their success is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This is because it can feel as though their hard work and talent are diminished if success is attributed to circumstance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. However, success typically requires both skill and luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Overlooking good fortune can have several psychological and societal impacts:
*   **Justifying Social Status and Inequality:** Downplaying the importance of chance events makes it easier for successful individuals to attribute their wealth or power solely to their own intelligence, effort, and perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This perspective can make inequality more palatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   In one experiment, randomly designated team leaders in a discussion group, despite having no special aptitude or extra responsibilities, were consistently given an extra cookie when four were offered to the three-person team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This illustrates how achieving a certain status, even by chance, can lead to a sense of entitlement and deservingness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Reduced Generosity:** Research indicates that individuals who attribute their success to personal qualities contribute less to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. In a study, participants who listed their own actions as reasons for a good event contributed 25% less to charity than those who listed external factors beyond their control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This suggests that a belief in self-made success can decrease generosity.
*   **[[egocentric_bias_and_selfattribution | Survivor Bias]] and Distorted Reality:** Leaders and those in positions of power, while often talented and hard-working, have also likely been luckier than most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Their personal experience of working hard and succeeding can create a [[egocentric_bias_and_selfattribution | survivor bias]], leading them to view the world as inherently fair and rewarding hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. They lack the experience of those who have worked hard and failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This perspective can lead to the conclusion that less successful individuals are simply less talented or less diligent, making them less inclined to be generous or support societal structures that benefited them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The Paradox of Success

While downplaying the importance of chance events can paradoxically improve one's probability of success (as perceiving an outcome as uncertain can decrease effort investment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, maintaining the "useful delusion" of being in full control of one's destiny is only one part of the equation for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The best advice for success in a world influenced by luck is paradoxical:
1.  **Believe in complete control:** Individuals should believe that their success is solely due to their talent and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This mindset encourages perseverance and effort.
2.  **Acknowledge the role of luck:** Simultaneously, one must recognize that this belief isn't entirely true for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

It is important to remember that luck plays a significant role in achievement, and consequently, successful individuals should strive to [[acknowledging_fortune_and_promoting_generosity | increase the luck of others]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## [[acknowledging_fortune_and_promoting_generosity | Acknowledging Fortune and Promoting Generosity]]

[[acknowledging_fortune_and_promoting_generosity | Acknowledging fortunate circumstances]] not only aligns one more closely with reality but also makes them more likable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. A study found that an entrepreneur who credited luck for their company's success was judged as kinder and more approachable than one who took sole personal credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Furthermore, raising awareness of fortunate events can foster gratitude and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

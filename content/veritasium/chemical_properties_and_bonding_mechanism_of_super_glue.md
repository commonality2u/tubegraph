Super glue is a powerful adhesive capable of bonding two metal cylinders with a single drop, strong enough to suspend a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A single drop can also easily lift over three tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Its rapid setting and strong bonding capabilities are due to its unique chemical composition and reaction mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Chemical Composition
Super glue in its tube form is a liquid composed of identical monomer molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The primary molecule is ethyl cyanoacrylate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

This molecule is highly reactive due to the presence of two double bonds and one triple bond positioned closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Specifically, it has a double bond attached to a nitrile group and an ester group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The chemistry of these groups makes the double bond electron deficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms attract electrons more than carbon, leaving a carbon atom slightly positively charged and "hungry" for electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This makes it susceptible to attack from anything even slightly electronegative, initiating a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Bonding Mechanism
When super glue is applied between two surfaces, the liquid flows into all available pores and crevices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The monomers then react with each other, forming long polymer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This process transforms the glue from a liquid to a solid, effectively binding the surfaces together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Polymerization Triggered by Water
The polymerization of super glue is primarily triggered by water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The slightly negative oxygen atoms in water molecules and negative hydroxide ions in water break open the carbon double bond, initiating the formation of polymer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Since moisture is ubiquitous—present in the air, on most surfaces, and absorbed into materials like fabrics—super glue sets rapidly on almost any surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Each water molecule can initiate the formation of a polymer chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

*   **Initiation**: In the presence of a negative ion (often from water), the carbon double bond breaks, and four single bonds form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The highly electronegative nitrile and ester groups pull the extra electron across the molecule, making a carbon atom negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Chain Reaction**: This negative carbon then attracts another slightly positive carbon on a separate monomer, linking them chemically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This starts a rapid chain reaction, with more and more monomers bonding together to form longer polymer chains until the super glue solidifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

This process typically takes between 10 and 30 seconds to set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, significantly faster than adhesives that rely on drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Adhesion to Skin
Skin is an ideal surface for super glue because it contains moisture and oils, which are perfect for super glue to bind with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Additionally, skin has many wrinkles and pores that the glue can seep into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The protein collagen in skin also has negative regions that can initiate the polymerization reaction and bond directly with a monomer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Some of your molecules literally become part of the polymer chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Strength and Rigidity
Super glue polymers are almost entirely single chains running linearly between surfaces, resembling wood grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. These chains are densely packed with some cross-linking, resulting in a rigid polymer, about as hard as a hard hat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. It exhibits strong compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Under tension, super glue is strongest when pulled in the same direction as its chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The tensile strength can exceed 25 mega pascals, comparable to other polymers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. A five-centimeter square patch could theoretically suspend a fully grown African elephant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Weaknesses

*   **Brittleness**: [[challenges_of_working_with_brittle_aerogel | Super glue is brittle]], meaning it falls apart under sudden impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Its rapid reaction often produces short polymer chains with built-in stress, which are potential failure points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Unlike squishy plastics (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, nylons) whose polymer chains can absorb impact by deforming, super glue's rigid bonds break under force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Shear Weakness**: Super glue is weak when a force is applied perpendicular to its polymer chains, known as shear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Shear force is a combination of compression and friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Unlike tension, which is unidirectional and allows for some polymer deformation, shear forces are more dynamic and cause bonds to break all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Stress isn't evenly distributed, being highest at the edges, and super glue's brittleness prevents stress redistribution, leading to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Peeling**: Peeling a surface glued with super glue concentrates force on a few polymers, causing chains to break one by one, like a zipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Inert Materials**: Super glue does not bond to chemically inert materials that lack reactive sites, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or Teflon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Carbon atoms in these materials are tightly bonded and unwilling to donate electrons, which super glue's electron-deficient carbons seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. These materials are also hydrophobic and non-porous, preventing water (the initiator) from interacting with the glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Modifications and Additives
Different additives can alter the properties of pure ethyl cyanoacrylate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>:
*   **Thickening Agents**: Pure monomers are very runny, like water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Companies add thickening agents, such as fumed silica, to increase viscosity and turn the glue into a gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   **Acid**: Some acid is often added to inhibit polymerization while the glue is in the tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Accelerators**: To speed up setting, more negative ions (initiators) can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
    *   **Baking Soda**: Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) reacts with moisture in the air to produce hydroxide ions, which act as initiators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. When combined with super glue, it sets faster and forms a hard composite substance that can strengthen joints, fill gaps, and even be drilled or sanded after setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Slowing Polymerization**: To glue things underwater, polymerization needs to be slowed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Gel cyanoacrylate, with its thickeners, achieves this by slowing the reaction, allowing time to apply and detach objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## [[medical_uses_and_developments_of_super_glue | Medical Uses and Developments]]
Super glue's potential in medicine was realized when its inventor, Harry Coover, sealed his son's cut finger with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. His team aimed to replace sutures, but faced three challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>:
1.  **Heat Release**: As bonds form, heat is released, which can irritate a wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. A standard cotton ball with super glue can reach over 120°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
2.  **Toxicity**: Over time, super glue in the body breaks down into toxic chemicals like formaldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
3.  **Brittleness**: Standard super glue is hard and brittle, unlike flexible living tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

These problems were solved by increasing the number of carbons in the alkyl chain of the molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Longer carbon chains slow the binding of monomers, reducing heat release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Longer polymers also break down much slower, allowing wounds to heal before toxins are released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. The slower reaction also allows for longer, more flexible polymers that can absorb stress better, making the glue pliable for tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## [[potential_of_super_glue_for_plastic_recycling | Potential for Plastic Recycling]]
Scientists are exploring super glue's original form as a plastic to address plastic pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Unlike other plastics that degrade during mechanical recycling, super glue polymers can break back down into pure monomers when heated to 210°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. These monomers can then be distilled and reactivated into fresh polymer, enabling a truly sustainable, depolymerizable plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

Challenges for this application included its sticky nature and brittleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. These were overcome by:
1.  **Handling**: Utilizing inert plastics like polypropylene, polyethylene, and Teflon to contain and handle the monomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
2.  **Reducing Brittleness**:
    *   **Weak Base Initiator**: Using a very weak base, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as an initiator allows for slower polymerization, producing longer polymer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
    *   **Solvent**: Adding a solvent like acetone dilutes the conditions and provides additional mobility for polymers to form even longer, more stable chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. After setting, the acetone evaporates, leaving the new plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

This method achieves an excellent recycling yield of around 93% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, significantly outperforming most widely recycled plastics which degrade and are downcycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

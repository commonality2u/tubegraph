According to the [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general theory of relativity]], gravity is not a force, and there are no gravitational fields; gravity is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Einstein's Happiest Thought: The Equivalence Principle

Albert Einstein's "happiest thought" was imagining a man falling off the roof of a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This thought made him happy because he realized the falling man would feel weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Anything the man dropped would remain stationary or move in uniform motion relative to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This scenario is analogous to being in deep space, far from large masses, where a spaceship is at rest or coasting at a constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. In deep space, one feels no weight, and objects either remain stationary or move in straight lines at constant velocity if pushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. An observer in such a state is an inertial observer, not accelerating or in a gravitational field, and all laws of physics apply in their reference frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Einstein's big leap was concluding that these two scenarios – a man falling off a roof and a "Rocket Man" in deep space – are not just similar, but **physically equivalent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This means the falling man is *not* in a gravitational field and is *not* accelerating; he is an inertial observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | equivalence principle]] emphasizes the observer's experience: if they feel weightless, they are in an inertial frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Even as Rocket Man approaches a planet and speeds up, he still feels weightless and an onboard accelerometer would not register a blip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. His frame of reference remains inertial until he crashes into the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Curved Spacetime and Geodesics

The concept of [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime and geodesics]] explains how objects appear to move in curves without a gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Rocket Man observes himself moving in a straight line with constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This is because he *is* moving in a straight line through spacetime, but spacetime itself is curved around massive objects like planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This curvature makes his path appear curved to a distant observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

This concept is analogous to an airplane flying the shortest route (a straight line) between cities on the curved surface of Earth, which doesn't *look* like a straight line on a flat map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. These shortest paths on curved surfaces are called **geodesics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The same term, geodesics, is used for the straight-line paths followed by inertial observers through [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Another analogy involves two people setting off due North from points on the equator 1000 kilometers apart; they will eventually come closer and bump into each other at the North Pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. It seems like a force is pushing them together, but they feel no such force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This apparent "force" is akin to gravity; it doesn't actually exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The real reason for their convergence is that they are following straight paths (geodesics) on a curved surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Astronauts on the space station are weightless, meaning they are inertial observers traveling on a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The Earth curves spacetime around it, which is why their straight-line path appears as a helix, or a circular orbit if the time dimension is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Bent Sheet Analogy
> The standard bent sheet analogy for [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime]] can be misleading because it can trick one into thinking that objects fall towards the middle of a well due to a gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. However, in [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]], there is no gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Instead, objects travel on straight-line paths through [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | spacetime]], and it's the curvature of spacetime around massive objects that makes these paths appear non-straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Acceleration and Standing Still on Earth

If a rocket in deep space accelerates at 9.8 meters per second squared, an external observer would see objects inside remain stationary while the rocket floor accelerates into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Inside, everything would appear to accelerate towards the "ground," and occupants would feel a force pushing up on their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This situation feels exactly the same as being at rest on the surface of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Therefore, an observer at rest on Earth is *not* in an inertial frame of reference because they do not feel weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Their situation is identical to someone accelerating on a rocket ship in deep space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. In [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]], being at rest in a gravitational field *is* accelerating in a rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. You are accelerating, and there is no gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

In standard Newtonian physics, weight (force of gravity) is depicted as pushing down, balanced by an equal and opposite normal force from the floor, resulting in no net force and no acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. However, in [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]], gravity is not a force, and you have no weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The only force on you is the normal force pushing you up, meaning you are accelerating upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

While you may not perceive yourself moving up relative to the floor, this is because the floor is also in your non-inertial frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. An observer in an inertial frame of reference, like the man falling off the roof, would see you accelerating upwards at 9.8 meters per second squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Acceleration, in this context, is defined as a deviation from a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The floor applies an upward force, preventing you from following a straight-line path through spacetime, thus causing you to accelerate upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

Even though you are accelerating upwards, the Earth is not expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. According to one of the [[general_relativity_equations | general relativity equations]], the second derivative of your position with respect to time (your acceleration) is influenced by the curvature of spacetime and your velocity through time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. In curved spacetime, your position can remain unchanged (zero spatial acceleration), yet you are still accelerating due to the spacetime curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Therefore, in [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime]], you need to accelerate just to stand still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## The Mystery of Falling Objects

One classical mystery simplified by [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]] is why all objects fall at the same rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. In Newtonian physics, the equation for a free-falling body (`gMm/r² = ma`) allows the object's mass to cancel out, leading to the same acceleration for all objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The mystery lies in why the gravitational mass (creating/experiencing a gravitational field) and inertial mass (resistance to acceleration) are numerically identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Scientists have experimentally verified this identity to one part in 10 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

In [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]], there is no such mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. All objects appear to fall the same way because they are not accelerating; they are simply following straight-line paths through spacetime until something stops them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Just like objects in the accelerating rocket ship appear to fall at the same rate because it's the floor accelerating into them, not them accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## Experimental Tests and Predictions

[[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | Einstein's theory]] faced skepticism when proposed in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. To test it, Einstein devised a measurable prediction: the bending of light by a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

### Light Deflection

In a rocket ship coasting through deep space, a light beam would travel in a straight line across the cabin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. If the rocket is accelerating, an external observer would still see the light travel in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. However, inside the accelerating rocket, by the time the light crosses the cabin, the rocket would have sped up, causing the light to hit the opposite wall slightly lower than its source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This demonstrates that an accelerating frame of reference will bend light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

Einstein reasoned that if an accelerating frame bends light, then light must also bend when it passes a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The ideal experiment was to observe light from distant stars passing just next to the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This was challenging due to the Sun's brightness, but a total solar eclipse provided the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

In 1919, Arthur Eddington photographed stars near the Sun during a total solar eclipse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. His analysis showed that the stars' positions were deflected by the precise amount predicted by [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]], which was twice the deflection calculated using a strictly Newtonian model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This [[experiments_and_predictions_related_to_general_relativity | experiment]] provided significant validation for [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### Future Experimental Tests

While [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]] has passed virtually every test for over a century, more [[experiments_and_predictions_related_to_general_relativity | experiments]] can be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. One conceptual test involves comparing the behavior of a stationary charged particle in a gravitational field to a free-falling one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>:

*   **Newtonian Picture:** A stationary charge should not radiate electromagnetic radiation, but a free-falling charge (accelerating) should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **General Relativity Picture:** A free-falling charge is non-accelerating (following a straight path through [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime]]) and should not radiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. A stationary charge, however, *is* accelerating (as it's prevented from following a geodesic by the normal force) and therefore *should* radiate electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Logistical challenges have prevented this [[experiments_and_predictions_related_to_general_relativity | experiment]] from being carried out, but one's belief in its outcome reveals their true understanding of the nature of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

According to [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Einstein's general theory of relativity]], gravity is not a force and gravitational fields do not exist; instead, gravity is considered an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Einstein's Happiest Thought and the Equivalence Principle
[[einsteins_equivalence_principle_and_its_implications | Albert Einstein's happiest thought]] was imagining a man falling off the roof of a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This thought led to the realization that the falling man would feel weightless and objects dropped by him would remain stationary or in uniform motion relative to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This scenario is identical to being in deep space, away from large masses, either at rest or coasting at constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. In such a situation, an observer feels no weight, and objects maintain their state of motion, defining an inertial observer who is not accelerating and is not in a gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The core of [[einsteins_equivalence_principle_and_its_implications | Einstein's equivalence principle]] states that these two scenarios—a man falling from a roof and an observer in deep space—are physically equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This implies that the falling man is not in a gravitational field and is not accelerating; he is an inertial observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The principle emphasizes the observer's experience: if they feel weightless, they are in an inertial frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Gravity as Curved Spacetime
In [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | General Relativity]], the appearance of gravity is explained by [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. An object, such as a rocket, that appears to an external observer to bend its path towards a planet, is actually moving in a straight line through [[curved_spacetime and geodesics | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | spacetime]] around massive objects like planets is curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

The "straightest paths" over curved surfaces are called [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | geodesics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This concept applies to inertial observers moving through [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. For example, two people walking due North from the equator will eventually meet at the North Pole, not due to a force, but because they are following [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | straight paths (geodesics)]] on a curved surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Similarly, astronauts on the space station are weightless because they are inertial observers traveling on a [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | geodesic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Their path appears as a helix because the Earth curves [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Misconceptions of the Bent Sheet Analogy
The standard "bent sheet analogy" for [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime]] can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It might suggest objects fall into a well due to gravitational force, but in [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | General Relativity]], there is no gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The correct intuition is that objects travel on straight-line paths through [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | spacetime]], which appears curved because [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | spacetime]] itself is curved around massive objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The interaction is summarized as: "Matter tells [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | spacetime]] how to curve, and [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | spacetime]] tells matter how to move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Acceleration and Reference Frames
When a rocket accelerates in deep space, objects inside appear to accelerate towards the floor, and an observer feels a force pushing up on their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This sensation is exactly like being at rest on the surface of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. According to [[einsteins_equivalence_principle_and_its_implications | Einstein's equivalence principle]], being at rest in a gravitational field is the exact same thing as accelerating in a rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Therefore, if you are not weightless, you are not an inertial observer; you are accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

In [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | General Relativity]], an observer standing on Earth is accelerating upwards, not because of a gravitational force pulling them down, but because the normal force from the floor is constantly accelerating them away from their [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | geodesic]] path through [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. An inertial observer, like the man falling off the roof, would see someone standing on Earth accelerating upwards at 9.8 meters per second squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This acceleration is a deviation from a [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | geodesic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. In [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime]], one needs to accelerate just to stand still, even if spatial coordinates are not changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## The Mystery of Falling Objects
One classical mystery, why all objects fall at the same rate, becomes simpler in [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | General Relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. In Newtonian physics, the fact that gravitational mass (creating/experiencing gravity) and inertial mass (resistance to acceleration) are numerically identical allows for the cancellation of mass in the force equation, leading to the same acceleration for all objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Scientists have performed extensive [[verification_of_physical_theories | experimental testing]] to confirm this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

However, in [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | General Relativity]], this is not a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Objects appear to fall at the same rate because they are not accelerating; they are simply following straight-line paths ([[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | geodesics]]) through [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | spacetime]] until something stops them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Just like objects inside an accelerating rocket appear to accelerate at the same rate because it is the floor accelerating into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## Experimental Verification and Future Tests
In 1915, [[einsteins_general_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]] proposed a measurable prediction: light should bend when passing a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This was based on the premise that light deflects in an accelerating frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### Light Bending
The ideal [[astronomical_observations_supporting_general_relativity | experiment]] was to observe light from distant stars passing near the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This was achieved by [[astronomical_observations_supporting_general_relativity | Arthur Eddington]] during a total solar eclipse in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. His findings showed that star positions were deflected by the precise amount predicted by [[einsteins_general_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]], which was twice the deflection calculated by a Newtonian model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This successful [[verification_of_physical_theories | verification of physical theories]] has stood for over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### The Unperformed Charge Radiation Experiment
A conceptually simple, but logistically challenging, [[verification_of_physical_theories | experimental test]] of [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | General Relativity]] involves comparing the behavior of a stationary electric charge in a gravitational field to a free-falling one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Newtonian View**: A stationary charge should not radiate, but a free-falling one (being accelerated by gravity) should radiate electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **General Relativity View**: A free-falling charge is non-accelerating, moving on a straight line through [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime]], and therefore should not radiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Conversely, a stationary charge (which is accelerating upwards relative to its [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | geodesic]]) *should* give off electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

The outcome of this experiment, if performed, would reveal fundamental truths about the nature of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

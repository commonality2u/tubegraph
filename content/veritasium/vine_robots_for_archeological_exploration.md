Vine robots, a type of [[soft_robots_and_their_unique_properties | soft robot]] that grows from the tip when powered by compressed air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, have found a compelling application in archeological exploration. Their unique properties make them ideal for investigating spaces inaccessible to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Design and Functionality
Vine robots are constructed from airtight tubing folded in on itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. They grow by inflating with compressed air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This allows them to pass through tight spaces and navigate over sticky surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Even if punctured by spikes, the robot can continue to operate as long as sufficient air pressure is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For practical applications like archeology, the basic growing mechanism is equipped with steering, a camera, and sensors, along with some form of intelligence to direct its path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Camera Integration
For exploration, a camera is essential. It can be attached to the front of the robot using an end cap, where it is pushed from behind as the robot grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Another method involves mounting a tiny wireless camera on an external frame that interlocks with an internal frame inside the pressurized body, preventing it from falling off during growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Active Steering
Vine robots can be actively steered using pneumatic muscles, which are typically tubes of ripstop nylon fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. These muscles are connected to their own air supplies. By inflating or deflating these muscles along the robot's sides, the robot can be steered by shortening and lengthening different sides, similar to how tendons move a hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Application in Peru
The vine robot was deployed in Peru to investigate very narrow shafts at an ancient archeological site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This site, built between 1500 and 500 BC in the Andes mountains, featured an ancient temple with underground spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Archeologists sought to understand the purpose of these spaces and the intentions of their builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

The temple included large rooms called galleries and smaller ducts or tunnels leading off from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. These ducts were too small for a person to enter, preventing archeologists from knowing where they led <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The vine robot successfully explored three of these otherwise unseen tunnels, providing video footage to the archeology team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

This application highlights the robot's ability to fit through tight spaces, avoid getting stuck, and remain unaffected by sharp objects, making it an ideal tool for archeological exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

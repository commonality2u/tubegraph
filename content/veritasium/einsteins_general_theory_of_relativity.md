The [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | General Theory of Relativity]] is described as humanity's current best theory of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:13">[01:32:13]</a>. It predicts phenomena such as [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black holes]], white holes, and potentially parallel universes and wormholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>.

## Origin of General Relativity
The [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | General Theory of Relativity]] emerged partly due to a fundamental flaw in Newtonian gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. Isaac Newton in the 1600s concluded that every object with mass must attract every other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:10">[02:02:10]</a>. However, Newton was troubled by how masses separated by vast distances could exert a force on each other, considering it a great absurdity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>.

Over 200 years later, Albert Einstein figured out that gravity is mediated not by direct forces but by masses curving the spacetime in their vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. For example, the sun curves spacetime around it, which then affects the earth's orbit, meaning the earth orbits the sun because the spacetime it's passing through is curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:01">[02:52:01]</a>. This eliminates the need for action at a distance, as masses are affected by the local curvature of spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>.

## Einstein's Field Equations
This concept is mathematically described by [[challenges_in_solving_einsteins_equations | Einstein's field equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:03">[03:16:03]</a>. These equations, developed by Einstein after a decade of work following special relativity, describe the relationship between the distribution of matter and energy and the resulting curvature of spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:08">[03:23:08]</a>. Although they appear as a single line, they are a family of coupled differential equations, making them complex to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:08">[03:46:08]</a>.

Solutions to [[challenges_in_solving_einsteins_equations | Einstein's equations]] reveal how spacetime curves and how to measure the separation between two events within that curved geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:09">[06:00:09]</a>.

### Understanding Spacetime with Light Cones
To understand these solutions, tools like spacetime diagrams are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:02">[04:04:02]</a>.
*   **Future Light Cone**: If a flash of light goes off in empty space, everything that can and will ever happen to an observer occurs within the resulting light bubble, forming a future light cone when time is added to the spatial dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Light rays in these diagrams conventionally travel at 45 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:08">[04:43:08]</a>. This cone represents the only region of spacetime an observer can explore and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:07">[04:48:07]</a>.
*   **Past Light Cone**: Similarly, the past light cone represents all events that could have affected the observer up to the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   **Spacetime Interval**: In flat spacetime, the separation between two events is measured by the spacetime interval, which is consistent everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. Around a mass, spacetime is curved, requiring modification of the equation to account for the geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Schwarzschild Solution
Einstein published his equations in 1915 but could not find an exact solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. Karl Schwarzschild, an astrophysicist serving on the Eastern Front during WWI, found the first non-trivial solution within weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

### Assumptions and the Metric
Schwarzschild simplified the scenario to an eternal, static universe containing only a single spherically symmetric, electrically neutral, non-rotating point mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. He used spherical coordinates relative to the mass's center and chose a time coordinate measured by someone far away where spacetime is flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

The resulting Schwarzschild metric describes how spacetime curves outside this mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. It indicates that spacetime is nearly flat far from the mass but becomes increasingly curved closer to it, attracting objects and causing time to run slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

### Problem Spots and Black Holes
Soon after publication, two problematic spots were identified in the Schwarzschild solution:
1.  **Singularity at r=0**: At the center of the mass, the equation breaks down because a term is divided by zero, leading to a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
2.  **Schwarzschild Radius**: At a specific distance from the center, known as the Schwarzschild radius, another term blows up, indicating a second singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. At this radius, the spacetime curvature is so steep that the escape velocity equals the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. This means nothing, not even light, can escape from inside this radius, creating a [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

Initially, most scientists doubted the existence of such objects because they would require an immense mass to collapse into a tiny space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

## Astrophysical Evidence and Conceptual Challenges
Astronomers studied stellar evolution to understand what happens at the end of a star's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. Gravity pulls star material inward, but during its lifetime, it's balanced by outward radiation pressure from nuclear fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. When the fuel runs out, this pressure drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

*   **White Dwarfs**: In 1926, Ralph Fowler proposed electron degeneracy pressure, based on Pauli's exclusion principle and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, could prevent complete collapse, forming a white dwarf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. Such stars, like Sirius B, had already been observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
*   **Chandrasekhar Limit**: In 1930, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar realized that electron degeneracy pressure has limits, as electrons cannot wiggle faster than the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. This meant stars beyond a certain mass (the Chandrasekhar limit) could not be supported by this pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
*   **Neutron Stars**: Scientists later discovered that stars heavier than the Chandrasekhar limit could collapse further, causing electrons and protons to fuse into neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. Neutron degeneracy pressure, stronger due to neutrons' greater mass, supports neutron stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

A strong conviction persisted that some physical process would prevent a star from collapsing into a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. However, in the late 1930s, Jay Robert Oppenheimer and George Volkoff found that neutron stars also have a maximum mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Shortly after, Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder showed that the heaviest stars would continue to contract indefinitely once their fuel ran out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

### Einstein's Doubt and Oppenheimer's Clarification
Einstein remained skeptical because his math showed time freezing on the horizon, implying nothing could ever enter a [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. Oppenheimer offered a solution: an outside observer would never see anything enter, as the object would appear to stop and fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. However, an observer traveling across the event horizon would not notice anything unusual and would pass through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

## Visualizing Black Holes
A spacetime diagram of a [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]] shows the singularity at r=0 and the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. Far from the horizon, future light cones are at 45 degrees, but they narrow as one approaches the horizon, pointing straight up at the horizon itself, and tipping to the left inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. This tipping signifies that all paths lead to the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.

### Coordinate Systems and True Singularities
The "singularity" at the event horizon in the Schwarzschild metric is not a true physical singularity but an artifact of the chosen coordinate system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>. By choosing a different coordinate system through a substitution, this apparent singularity disappears, allowing objects to cross into the [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>.

### Waterfall Model
Another visualization is the waterfall model, where space itself flows towards the [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]] like a waterfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>.
*   Closer to the black hole, space flows faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.
*   Photons escaping the black hole must "swim" against this flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.
*   At the horizon, space falls inward as fast as photons can travel, so photons from inside cannot escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.
*   Inside the horizon, space falls faster than light, pulling everything towards the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.
*   An outside observer never sees anything truly *enter* the black hole, only photons emitted just outside the horizon that become dimmer and redder until they fade from view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>. However, an infalling observer would cross the event horizon without feeling anything unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

### Kruskal-Szekeres and Penrose Diagrams
*   **Kruskal-Szekeres Diagram**: By transforming a spacetime map so that incoming and outgoing light rays always travel at 45 degrees, the [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]] singularity transforms into a curved line at the top, indicating it's a moment in time rather than a place in space—the last moment for anything entering the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>.
*   **Penrose Diagram**: This diagram contracts the entire universe (infinite past, distance, and future) into a single map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. Light rays still travel at 45 degrees, the future points up, the infinite past is at the bottom, and infinite distance is at the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. The [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]] singularity becomes a straight line at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>. This map clarifies regions of influence and accessibility within spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>.

## White Holes
The Penrose diagram also reveals a new region: a [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | white hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. This is the time-reversed opposite of a [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]]: things can only be expelled from it, and nothing can enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. Since [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | relativity]] does not inherently dictate the direction of time, mathematically, any solution can be time-reversed to yield another valid solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>. A [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | white hole]] would "kick you out" if you were inside its event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>.

## Parallel Universes and Wormholes (Schwarzschild Solution)
Pushing the Schwarzschild Penrose diagram to its limits reveals further structures, including the existence of parallel universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>. The simplest solution to [[challenges_in_solving_einsteins_equations | Einstein's field equations]] contains a [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]], a [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | white hole]], and two universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a>.

The point where these universes cross is an [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | Einstein-Rosen Bridge]], which is a wormhole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>. This hypothetically connects the space of both universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27:00">[27:27:00]</a>. However, these wormholes are not stable in time; they pinch off too quickly for anything to travel through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>. Travel through them would require faster-than-light speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>.

## Rotating Black Holes (Kerr Solution)
The Schwarzschild solution describes a non-rotating [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]], but every star rotates, implying that every [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]] must also rotate due to the conservation of angular momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>. Solving [[challenges_in_solving_einsteins_equations | Einstein's equations]] for a spinning mass was significantly harder, taking 40 years until Roy Kerr found the solution in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>.

The Kerr solution introduces several dramatic changes:
*   **Layered Structure**: The [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]] now has multiple layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Spherically Symmetric**: Rotation causes bulging at the equator, making it symmetric only about its spin axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>.
*   **Frame-Dragging (Ergosphere)**: Space itself gets dragged around with the rotating [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]], pulling objects along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>. The ergosphere is the first new region where space is dragged faster than the speed of light, making it impossible to stay still relative to distant stars, though escape is still possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>.
*   **Inner and Outer Horizons**: Beyond the ergosphere lies the outer horizon (point of no return), followed by an inner event horizon where movement becomes freer again, and the singularity can be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:39:00">[30:39:00]</a>.
*   **Ring Singularity**: In a rotating [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black hole]], the singularity expands from a point into a ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. It is theorized that one might be able to fly through this ring singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:23:00">[31:23:00]</a>.
*   **Penrose Diagram of Kerr Black Hole**: This diagram shows the singularity lifting and moving to the sides, revealing a new region inside the inner horizon where one can move freely and avoid the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>. Venturing further could lead to a [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | white hole]] pushing into another universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>, or even an "anti-verse" where gravity pushes instead of pulls, by passing through the ring singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>. This maximally extended solution implies an infinite number of universes connected by [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black holes]] and [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | white holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14:00">[33:14:00]</a>.

## Reality of These Solutions
There are issues with the maximal extensions of both Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions:
*   **Eternal Solutions**: Both are solutions for eternal black holes in an empty universe, lacking a formation mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>. This is a reason why [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | white holes]] are not believed to exist in our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>.
*   **Inner Horizon Instability (Kerr)**: In the maximally extended Kerr solution, an immortal astronaut could send light into the black hole, creating an infinite flux of energy along the inner horizon, which would then form its own singularity, sealing off the ring singularity and regions beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:24:00">[34:24:00]</a>. This suggests that the inner horizon would become singular, preventing travel to these other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>.
*   **Traversable Wormholes**: In 1987, Michael Morris and Kip Thorne explored wormholes that could be used for interstellar travel, which would need to be traversable (no horizons), stable, and constructible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>. While [[applications_of_noneuclidean_geometry_in_general_relativity | Einstein's general relativity]] allows for such geometries in theory, they require an exotic kind of matter with negative energy density to prevent collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:39:00">[35:39:00]</a>. Most physicists believe this exotic matter is unlikely to exist, making such wormholes impossible under the known properties of matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:00">[35:48:00]</a>.

Therefore, according to current understanding, white holes, traversable wormholes, and these parallel universes likely do not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>. However, it's acknowledged that past beliefs about [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | black holes]] being impossible were overturned, so future surprises remain a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>.

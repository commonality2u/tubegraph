The quietest place on Earth is reportedly an [[anechoic_chambers_and_their_effects_on_the_human_mind | anechoic chamber]] located in Minneapolis, with another present at BYU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The term "anechoic" is Latin for "no echo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These chambers achieve their extreme quietness through the use of foam wedges on the walls and even the floor, which is often a spring floor with wedges underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The foam's design allows low-frequency sounds to bounce indefinitely until they dissipate, while high frequencies are absorbed directly into the foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This construction drastically alters the quality of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Initial Psychological and Physical Responses

Entering an [[anechoic_chambers_and_their_effects_on_the_human_mind | anechoic chamber]] can immediately evoke a sense of claustrophobia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This feeling is not due to a change in air composition, but rather the absence of reverb that is typically present in normal rooms, which provides a sense of space to the ear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Without these familiar auditory cues, the room can feel tiny, akin to being in a coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Some individuals also report feeling pressure on their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The extreme silence can trigger an [[psychological_responses_to_extreme_silence | anxiety response]] because individuals are accustomed to constant ambient sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The lack of these familiar sounds can lead to panic and increased stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. There are also reports that extended stays can lead to disorientation, dizziness, nausea, and even auditory hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Visitors are often warned that if they feel dizzy, they should notify staff to be escorted out of the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Amplified Internal Sounds and Sensations

As one remains in the profound silence of an [[anechoic_chambers_and_their_effects_on_the_human_mind | anechoic chamber]], the perception of their own body's sounds becomes significantly amplified:
*   **Clothing Rustle** Every slight movement of clothing becomes audible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Internal Fluids** Sounds of fluids in the mouth or throat, such as swallowing or breathing, become distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Blood Flow** The longer one stays, the more they begin to hear the sound of blood flowing through their brain, described as a ringing or pulsing sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This pulsing sound is like a "shh, shh, shh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Heartbeat** Some individuals report hearing their own heartbeat emanating from their chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Aural Hiss** A personal hiss in the ears can be noticed, which may be attributed to hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Amplified Quiet Sounds** The brain seems to recalibrate, making normally quiet sounds, like a burp or rubbing one's beard, seem much louder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Beyond just hearing, people also report distinct physical sensations:
*   **Heartbeat Sensation** A heightened awareness of the heart, with each pulse feeling palpable and radiating up the chest towards the head like a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Body Vibration** With each heartbeat, the body can feel like it shakes slightly, akin to a device with a small motor inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This is a feeling of the heart shaking the body, rather than an auditory perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## [[debunking_myths_about_silence_driving_people_crazy | Debunking Myths about Silence Driving People Crazy]]

Despite claims that it's impossible to remain sane or stand for long periods in an [[anechoic_chambers_and_their_effects_on_the_human_mind | anechoic chamber]], one individual spent nearly an hour inside without experiencing any "crazy" effects or hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The experience was described as "nice and quiet" and even relaxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The person felt quite comfortable and did not fall asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

It was noted that genuine silence is difficult to achieve, as the individual continuously made internal and external noises, such as rubbing a beard or breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. While the physical sensations of the heart and body vibrations were unusual, they were not disorienting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This suggests that the widely reported myth that people cannot stay longer than 45 minutes without going crazy is "busted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. However, it is acknowledged that individuals who find pitch-black rooms or confined spaces uncomfortable might find the experience more unnerving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

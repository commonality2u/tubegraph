In [[classical_paths_versus_quantum_paths | classical mechanics]], knowing a system's state (e.g., a particle's position and velocity) allows for future prediction using equations like Newton's second law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. In quantum mechanics, the equivalent is knowing a particle's quantum state, which is its wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The Schrödinger equation is used to calculate how this wave function will evolve in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Typically, it spreads out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This smooth and continuous evolution from an initial state demonstrates a beautiful symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Measurement Problem and the Born Rule

A key challenge in quantum mechanics is that the wave function is never directly observed in its spread-out form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Instead, when a measurement is made, the particle is found at a single point in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This discrepancy between the smoothly evolving wave function and point-like particle detection is known as the measurement problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Early quantum theorists, prioritizing observation, considered the measurement more real than the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While Schrödinger formulated his wave equation based on the suspicion that matter has [[de_broglies_hypothesis_and_waveparticle_duality | wave-like properties]] (notably by [[de_broglies_hypothesis_and_waveparticle_duality | de Broglie]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, it was Max Born who proposed how to interpret the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Max Born's Interpretation

Max Born suggested that if you take the complex amplitude of the wave function at each point in space and square it, you get the probability of finding the particle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This concept, known as the Born rule, introduced probability into the core of our understanding of reality, making the universe no longer deterministic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Despite initial discomfort from scientists like Einstein, the Born rule remains central to quantum mechanics due to its predictive success in experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Wave Function Collapse

The standard understanding of quantum mechanics operates under two rules:
1.  When not observed, the wave function evolves according to the Schrödinger equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
2.  When a measurement is made, the wave function collapses suddenly and irreversibly, with the probability of any outcome given by the squared amplitude of its associated wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Schrödinger's Cat Thought Experiment

Erwin Schrödinger famously invented the Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment to highlight his disdain for this "collapse" formulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. In this scenario:
*   A cat is placed in a box with a radioactive atom, a radiation detector, and a vial of poisonous cyanide gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   If the atom decays, the detector triggers the release of poison, and the cat dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   If the atom does not decay, the cat remains alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

The point of the experiment is to magnify the quantum state of the atom to a macroscopic, tangible level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Since the cat's state is directly tied to the atom's state, they are considered entangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. According to quantum mechanics, if no measurements have been made, the atom exists in a superposition of both decayed and not decayed states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This superposition then entangles with the detector and the cat, leading to a state where the cat is both alive and dead at the same time within the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Only when the box is opened and a measurement is made does the wave function "collapse," and the cat becomes definitively either dead or alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Schrödinger intended this to demonstrate that the quantum mechanical formulation of his time was flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Fundamental Components of Quantum Mechanics

To understand a better way to think about quantum mechanics, three essential components must be examined: superposition, entanglement, and measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Superposition

Superposition is the idea that quantum objects can exist in multiple states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This is indirectly observed in experiments like the double-slit experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. When individual electrons are fired through two slits, they produce an interference pattern on a screen, forcing the conclusion that a single electron somehow passes through both slits simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This phenomenon is easily understood when considering electrons as waves, which are spread out in space and can interfere with themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. When unobserved, electrons are represented by their wave function, which explains how they can pass through both slits at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Thus, superposition is considered a solid concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Entanglement

Entanglement describes a state where two or more quantum particles become intrinsically linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. For example, if two electrons scatter off each other, their individual trajectories are given by spread-out wave functions providing only probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. However, as soon as the momentum of one electron is measured, the momentum of the other is instantaneously known (it must be equal and opposite to conserve momentum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This is true even if the electrons are light-years apart, demonstrating entanglement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

The underlying reality of entanglement is that after interacting, the entangled electrons are described by a single, shared wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This single wave function collapses when one part is measured, immediately affecting the state of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Rigorously, there is only one wave function: the wave function of the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. However, for isolated, unentangled particles, it's reasonable to discuss individual wave functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. When they interact, entanglement occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Reconsidering Measurement: The [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many-Worlds Interpretation]]

The "measurement postulate"—the second set of rules connecting quantum mathematics to observation—seems peculiar, as it implies one set of rules for evolution when unobserved and another when observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Since measurement is merely the interaction of one quantum system with another, and all systems obey the Schrödinger equation, an alternative perspective is to discard the special rules for measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

In this alternative view, applied to Schrödinger's cat:
1.  The radioactive atom's superposition entangles with the detector, then the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
2.  Since observers are also quantum mechanical, when the box is opened, there is no "measurement" or wave function collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
3.  Instead, the observer simply becomes entangled with the state of everything inside the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
4.  This means the observer sees the cat both alive and dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

This seemingly impossible outcome is explained by the [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many-Worlds Interpretation]] (MWI), formulated by Hugh Everett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. In MWI, the "you" that saw the cat alive and the "you" that saw it dead inhabit separate, complete realities that will never interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Environmental Decoherence and Branching

The separation into distinct worlds occurs through environmental decoherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. When a quantum object in superposition becomes entangled with its environment (e.g., air molecules, photons), its wave function undergoes decoherence, effectively branching the wave function of the universe into slightly different copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

In the case of Schrödinger's cat, the detector, entangled with the atom's superposition, is bombarded by air molecules and photons that interact differently based on whether it detected radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This causes the detector (and subsequently the cat) to become entangled with the environment, leading to decoherence and branching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. At this moment, the observer is also split into two identical copies, each entangled with one outcome of the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The cat is already alive or dead in its respective branch; the observer is merely finding out which outcome they are experiencing in their particular branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The other outcome also happened, but to a different version of the observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Implications of Many-Worlds

*   **Continuous Branching**: The branching of the wave function is happening constantly and frequently, potentially infinitely often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. For example, radioactive decays occurring thousands of times per second in one's body cause constant branching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Natural Mathematics**: All these worlds are a natural consequence of the mathematics of quantum mechanics; removing them requires an ad hoc concept like wave function collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Cleaner Formalism**: MWI posits only wave functions evolving under the Schrödinger equation, making the formalism simpler and more elegant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Restored Determinism**: The universe becomes deterministic again, as every possible outcome happens 100% of the time across different branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Our experience of probability arises because we only perceive our tiny sliver of the multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The founders of quantum theory may have been incorrect in assuming the measurement was the complete picture of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Common Objections and Clarifications

*   **Energy Conservation**: Energy is conserved for the total wave function of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The universe is not duplicated but subdivided, with each branch contributing to the total energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Branching**: The exact frequency of branching is unknown, but it is certainly very often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Whether the total number of branches is infinite or finite depends on unresolved aspects of quantum gravity and cosmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **"Everything Possible Happens"**: MWI does *not* mean everything that could possibly happen happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. It means the wave function obeys the Schrödinger equation, which gives zero probability to events violating fundamental conservation laws (e.g., an electron converting into a proton) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Only possible outcomes with non-zero probability occur in some branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Instantaneous Branching**: Whether branching happens instantly throughout space or spreads out at the speed of light doesn't change the predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. This is because the concept of "branches" is a convenient human description of the wave function of the universe, not a fundamental feature of reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. It's akin to describing air temperature and pressure rather than listing every molecule's position and velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

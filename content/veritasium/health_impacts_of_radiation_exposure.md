[[understanding_ionizing_radiation|Radiation]] can be frightening, especially [[understanding_ionizing_radiation|ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A Geiger counter specifically measures [[understanding_ionizing_radiation|ionizing radiation]], which possesses enough energy to dislodge electrons from atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This type of [[understanding_ionizing_radiation|radiation]] is quantified in units called Sieverts (Sv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. An immediate exposure of more than 2 Sieverts is likely to be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Daily and Background Exposure

Despite the dangers of high doses, humans are continuously exposed to low levels of [[understanding_ionizing_radiation|ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>:
*   **Food** Bananas, rich in potassium, contain a naturally radioactive isotope. Consuming a banana exposes an individual to approximately 0.1 micro-Sieverts (µSv) of [[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations|radiation]], equivalent to 1/10 millionth of a Sievert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Human Contact** Being in close proximity to others, such as sleeping next to someone, results in a slightly higher [[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations|radiation]] dose than being alone, though this amount is negligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Natural Environment** The Earth's natural [[background_radiation_levels_globally|background radiation]] originates from sources like soil, rocks, air, and even [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation and_space_missions|cosmic rays]] from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Globally, average [[background_radiation_levels_globally|background radiation]] levels typically range between 0.1 and 0.2 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Historical and Disaster Sites

Historically significant sites of [[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations|radiation]] exposure include:
*   **Hiroshima, Japan** The site of the world's first nuclear bomb detonation over a city (August 6, 1945) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Nearly 70 years later, the [[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations|radiation]] level remains low at approximately 0.3 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Jáchymov Uranium Mine, Czech Republic** This historic uranium mine, where Marie Curie sourced her raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, has [[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations|radiation]] levels of around 17 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is about 10 times the natural [[background_radiation_levels_globally|background radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Even Marie Curie's former doorknob and chair in her office still show traces of radium, emitting alpha particles and demonstrating radiation levels 10 times the normal background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Trinity Bomb Test Site, New Mexico, USA** The location of the world's first nuclear bomb test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The intense heat from the explosion fused desert sand into a unique green glass called trinitite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The general area has radiation levels of about 8 µSv per hour, with the trinitite itself measuring 2 to 3 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This is the only place on Earth where trinitite was formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor No. 4, Ukraine** Following its meltdown on April 26, 1986, radioactive isotopes spread across the surrounding area and into Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Current [[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations|radiation]] levels near the reactor are around 5 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. To mitigate contamination, meters of topsoil were removed and disposed of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   **Pripyat Hospital Basement, Ukraine** This location, where firefighters' highly contaminated clothing from the Chernobyl disaster was discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, is one of the most radioactive places on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Readings just outside the door reached 500 µSv per hour, and within the room, they were as high as 1,500 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. An hour in this basement would result in a dose of 2,000 µSv, equivalent to a year's worth of natural [[background_radiation_levels_globally|background radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Fukushima Exclusion Zone, Japan** Following the nuclear accident, the Japanese began collecting and bagging meters of contaminated topsoil, similar to the efforts in Chernobyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Although the release of radioactive material was only about 10% of Chernobyl's, its freshness (only three years since the accident) means less has decayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Readings in the zone range from 5 to 10 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Residents around Fukushima are estimated to receive an additional 10,000 µSv over their lifetime due to the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Other Significant Exposures

High levels of [[understanding_ionizing_radiation|ionizing radiation]] exposure also occur in various contexts:
*   **Air Travel** As altitude increases, there is less atmospheric shielding from [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation and_space_missions|cosmic rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Radiation levels inside an airplane can reach:
    *   0.5 µSv per hour at 18,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
    *   1 µSv per hour at 23,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
    *   Over 2 µSv per hour at 33,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
    *   Over 3 µSv per hour at higher altitudes and near the poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
*   **Medical Procedures** A single CT scan exposes a patient to approximately 7,000 µSv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, which is equivalent to three years of natural [[background_radiation_levels_globally|background radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. A dental x-ray results in a dose similar to one hour at Chernobyl's current radiation level (5 µSv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Occupational Exposure**
    *   **Radiation Workers** In the United States, [[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations|radiation workers]] are limited to a maximum annual dose of 50,000 µSv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
    *   **Astronauts** An astronaut on the International Space Station for six months receives about 80,000 µSv of [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel|radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Smoking** The highest regular exposure to [[understanding_ionizing_radiation|ionizing radiation]] comes from smoking. A smoker's lungs, on average, receive 160,000 µSv of [[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations|radiation]] annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This is due to radioactive polonium and [[impact_of_tetraethyl_lead_on_global_health|radioactive lead]] present in tobacco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

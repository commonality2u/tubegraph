From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Gyroscopic precession is a phenomenon where the applied torque on a spinning object results in a change in the axis of rotation perpendicular to the applied torque, rather than in the direction of the torque itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This effect can lead to surprising demonstrations of apparent "weightlessness" or reduced effort when interacting with a spinning mass.

## Experimental Demonstration

A demonstration of gyroscopic precession was conducted using a 19-kilogram (40-pound) [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | flywheel]] on the end of a one-meter long shaft, built by the mechanical engineering shop at the University of Sydney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

### Holding a Non-Spinning Flywheel

Attempting to hold the [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | flywheel]] horizontally with one hand at the end of the shaft without it spinning is virtually impossible due to its weight and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Similarly, lifting the non-spinning [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | flywheel]] over one's head with a single hand at the end of the shaft is extremely difficult, described as "just barely" manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### The Effect of Spinning

When the [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | flywheel]] is spun up to a few thousand RPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, its behavior changes dramatically:
*   **Horizontal Stability**: If held horizontally by one hand, the shaft remains horizontal, seemingly defying gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The wheel appears almost "weightless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Torque Redirection**: Instead of pulling the [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | flywheel]] straight down, its weight creates a torque that causes it to move around in a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This circular motion is identified as gyroscopic precession <a class="yt=" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Perceived Lightness vs. Actual Weight

### Overhead Lifting Test

Lifting the spinning [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | flywheel]] over one's head with a single hand becomes "incredibly light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> and feels "smooth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The experimenter reported feeling as if the [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | flywheel]] "was wanting to go up by itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> and did not require the expected amount of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Weight Measurement Experiment

To further investigate the perceived lightness, an experiment was set up to measure the actual weight using a scale:
*   **Baseline Weight**: The experimenter's weight alone was approximately 72 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Non-Spinning Weight**: When the experimenter held the non-spinning 19-kilogram (42-pound) [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | flywheel]], the total weight on the scale increased to about 91 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Prediction Question**: The experiment posed a question for the viewer: when lifting the spinning [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | flywheel]] over their head, would the scale reading be more, less than, or equal to 91 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>? This question is posed to highlight the often counter-intuitive nature of gyroscopic effects on apparent weight.

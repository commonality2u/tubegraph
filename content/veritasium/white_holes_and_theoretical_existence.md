From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

White holes are a theoretical concept derived from [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | Einstein's general theory of relativity]], representing the opposite of a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. They are featured in discussions about the real science of [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]], white holes, and [[Parallel universes and wormholes | wormholes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Characteristics of a White Hole

Unlike [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] from which nothing can escape, white holes are regions of spacetime where things can come out, but nothing can ever enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This means if you are inside a white hole's event horizon, you *must* be ejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. The visual appearance of a white hole would depend on what light or mass is being expelled from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

## Origin in General Relativity

The existence of white holes arises from the [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | time-reversal symmetry]] of [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | general relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. Mathematically, any solution to [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | Einstein's equations]] can be flipped in time to yield another valid solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. The initial solutions to [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | Einstein's equations]], such as the Schwarzschild solution for a static [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], predicted not only [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] but also their theoretical opposite, white holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Penrose Diagrams and Multiple Universes

Penrose diagrams, which contract the infinite past, distance, and future of the universe into a single map, are useful for visualizing the full extent of solutions to [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | Einstein's equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

In a Penrose diagram of a Schwarzschild [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]]:
*   Drawing the past light cone from a point on the event horizon reveals a new region, which is the white hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   This diagram also suggests the existence of a [[Parallel universes and wormholes | parallel universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. The mathematics of the "maximal extension" of the Schwarzschild solution indicates the presence of a second universe with its own independent coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   The point where these regions cross in the diagram is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, commonly known as a [[Parallel universes and wormholes | wormhole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

For a rotating ([[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | Kerr]]) [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], the Penrose diagram is more complex. The singularity is not a single point but a ring, and it's hypothetically possible to fly through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. The diagram for a rotating [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] also implies a possibility of entering a white hole after passing through the inner horizon, which could then eject you into a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. This could theoretically lead to an infinite number of interconnected universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

## Theoretical vs. Physical Existence

Despite their mathematical possibility, the physical existence of white holes, traversable [[Parallel universes and wormholes | wormholes]], and these [[Parallel universes and wormholes | parallel universes]] is largely doubted by scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

Key issues include:
*   **Eternal Solutions** The Schwarzschild and [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | Kerr solutions]] describe eternal [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] in an empty universe, stretching infinitely into the past and future, lacking a formation mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. This is considered a significant reason why [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] are realized in our universe but white holes are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.
*   **Inner Horizon Instability** For the maximally extended [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | Kerr solution]], an infinite flux of energy can build up along the inner horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. This concentration of energy is thought to create its own singularity, effectively sealing off the ring singularity and any potential beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. This suggests that the internal structure that allows for [[Parallel universes and wormholes | wormholes]] and other universes would collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

While [[Parallel universes and wormholes | wormholes]] without horizons (meaning you could travel back and forth) are allowed by [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | Einstein's general relativity]], they require "exotic matter" with negative energy density to prevent them from collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. Such matter is considered to be "against the laws of physics" based on our current understanding of matter's properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

Thus, according to our current best understanding, white holes, traversable [[Parallel universes and wormholes | wormholes]], and [[Parallel universes and wormholes | parallel universes]] connected through [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] are unlikely to exist in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. However, the history of physics, where [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] themselves were once doubted, suggests that future [[verification_of_physical_theories | discoveries]] could still bring surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.

## Introduction to 3D Printed Rockets

[[Impact of 3D printing on rocket design and manufacturing | 3D printing]] is revolutionizing aerospace engineering, particularly in rocket manufacturing. Relativity Space, a startup, has built what is claimed to be the world's largest 3D metal printer, named Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, with the ambitious goal of printing an entire rocket, including fuel tanks and engines, in just 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This represents a significant shift from traditional manufacturing methods.

## How Large-Scale Metal 3D Printing Works

Relativity Space's Stargate printer utilizes a wire melt process. The print head moves around, and a plasma discharge occurs at the tip of an aluminum alloy wire spool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This process involves the plasma discharge and lasers working together to melt the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The system precisely controls the deposition by changing the electric waveform every couple of milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The temperature used is just a few hundred degrees above aluminum's melting point of 660 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The wire is deposited at a rate of approximately 10 inches per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Even though the final product may still show layers and appear "3D printed," this roughness adds only 5 to 10% to the mass and does not cause any aerodynamic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. For critical sections, the printed part is machined afterwards to achieve a normal metal appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. A key innovation is the development of software that "reverse warps" the part before printing, ensuring it becomes perfectly straight, within a human hair's width, as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## [[Benefits and challenges of 3D printed rockets | Benefits of 3D Printing in Rocket Production]]

### Reduced Parts and Complexity
Traditional rocket manufacturing is a complex engineering project that requires building extensive tooling before the rocket itself can be constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. For example, NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) required the construction of a 170-foot-tall Vertical Assembly Center (VAC) just for welding fuel tank sections, a process that took 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. In contrast, Relativity Space, founded just five and a half years ago, plans to launch its first rocket within the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

One of the significant advantages of [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] is the substantial reduction in part count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Rocket Engine Injectors:** A critical part of a rocket engine that mixes propellants, traditionally made of over a thousand individual pieces and taking nine months to produce, can be 3D printed as a single unit in two weeks, at one-tenth the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Cooling Channels:** Rocket combustion chambers and nozzles experience extreme temperatures (up to 3,500 Kelvin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, requiring cryogenic propellant cooling channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Traditionally, this involved brazing thousands of small pipes together, as seen in the Space Shuttle main engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. [[Impact of 3D printing on rocket design and manufacturing | 3D printing]] allows these complex cooling channels to be integrated directly into the single-piece nozzle as it's built, using metal powder and lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This process involves laying down very fine layers, about one-twentieth the thickness of a human hair, over approximately a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

A [[comparison_between_traditional_and_3d_printed_rocket_production | fully 3D printed rocket]] can have a hundred times fewer parts than a traditionally manufactured one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This reduction in part count facilitates automation in aerospace, as the parts are "assembled" in the 3D file, and the printer produces them as a single integrated unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

### Enhanced Material Strength
Counterintuitively, [[Impact of 3D printing on rocket design and manufacturing | 3D printed metal]] materials can be stronger than those built traditionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This is due to the development of custom alloys and the rapid melting, cooling, and solidification process, which allows engineers to leverage specific physics principles to achieve high strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Rapid Iteration and Design Flexibility
[[Impact of 3D printing on rocket design and manufacturing | 3D printing]] enables rapid iteration, allowing engineers to quickly build, test, and redesign parts. For example, a rocket engine design can be entirely different and better within months due to this agile process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Since there's no fixed tooling, part geometries are controlled via CAD models, and printers print directly from these files, allowing for extremely fast design changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Building a whole engine takes only about a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

The approach also allows for entirely new rocket designs. Engineers can create smooth, curvy, or bio-inspired structures that would be impractical or impossible with traditional techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. These designs, like the 16-foot diameter shell of Relativity's Terran R rocket, leverage optimal structures that are only manufacturable through [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## [[Future prospects of 3D printing in space exploration | Future and Impact of 3D Printing in Space]]
Relativity Space envisions a future where this [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing technology]] and "factory of the future" can be scaled down and launched to Mars to build an industrial base there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. The company's Terran One rocket is designed for low-earth orbit, while Terran R can send payloads to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

While it's debated if [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] will always be the most cost-effective method for mass rocket production, companies like Relativity Space are becoming world experts in [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing rocket hardware]] by applying the technology to areas previously dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The aim is to significantly lower the cost of space access, potentially making flights 5 to 100 times cheaper than current rates with fully reusable rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. This shift could expand the possibilities of human experience and culture by enabling more people to go to space and potentially live on other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

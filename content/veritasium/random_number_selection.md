When asked to name a random number, people often exhibit predictable patterns, revealing that human intuition for randomness is "decidedly not random" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This phenomenon has been extensively studied, with particular attention paid to the number 37.

## The Blue-Seven Phenomenon and Number 37

Research shows that people are generally "really bad at selecting things randomly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. For instance, when asked to pick a color and a number, people consistently choose blue and 7 across various cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This pattern is known to [[the_psychology_of_numbers | psychologists]] as the "blue-seven phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

When extended to picking a random number between 1 and 100, the equivalent of the blue-seven phenomenon has long been suggested to be the number 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

Initial informal surveys asking people to name a random number between 1 and 100 frequently yielded 37 as a common response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. While 7 was the most common single-digit answer, likely due to expectations of a 1-10 range, 37 was surprisingly the most common two-digit number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Large-Scale Surveys

Despite the widespread belief, formal polls on this phenomenon were historically scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. A Reddit poll of 1,380 people found 69 as the most popular number, followed by 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

To conduct a more comprehensive study, a survey was launched on a community post, collecting 200,000 responses for a random number between 1 and 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The results showed remarkable consistency in distribution, suggesting a non-random pattern in human selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Excluding extremes (1 and 100), and culturally significant numbers like 42 and 69, the numbers that stood out as feeling "more random" were 7, 73, 77, and 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

When people were asked to pick the number they thought *fewest* others would pick (aiming for truly random selections by eliminating favorite/lucky numbers), 73 and 37 were again the most selected numbers, nearly tied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Ironically, the actual least-picked numbers were multiples of 10 (90, 30, 40, 70, 80, 60), as they don't seem random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Why 37 Feels "Random"

The consistent selection of 37 and 73 suggests they are not random choices at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. The reasons are multifaceted:

### Psychological Perception
*   **Odd Numbers**: People tend to perceive even numbers as less random than odd numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Extremes**: Numbers like 1, 9, or 50 feel "too extreme" or "too central" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This gravitates choices towards digits like 3 and 7, which were the most selected digits in the large-scale survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Multiples of 10**: Multiples of 10 (e.g., 30, 40) are seen as less random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### Mathematical Properties
*   **Primes Feel Random**: Prime numbers, like 37, often feel more random than composite numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
    *   They are less visible in everyday life, which is dominated by composite numbers (e.g., pixel counts, fruit boxes, square footage) that involve multiple dimensions multiplying together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
    *   There is no simple formula to find the next prime number; one must check each number individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. The [[the_prime_number_phenomenon | prime number theorem]] provides only an approximation for the nth prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>, implying primes "essentially occur at random" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   **Median Second Prime Factor**: For all integers from 1 to infinity, the median second prime factor is 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This means half of all numbers have a second prime factor of 37 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
*   **Other Unique Qualities**: 37 is an irregular prime, a Cuban prime, a lucky prime, a sexy prime, a permutable prime, and a Padovan prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

## The Practical Application: The 37% Rule

The number 37 also appears in [[mathematical_probability_strategies | mathematical probability strategies]] for optimal decision-making in specific scenarios, known as the "secretary problem" or "marriage problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.

This problem arises when faced with immediate and final choices (e.g., renting an apartment, accepting a job offer, picking a gas station) where all options cannot be assessed simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. One must decide to accept or reject an option forever upon encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

The optimal strategy to maximize the chance of picking the best option involves:
1.  **Exploration Phase**: Automatically rejecting a certain percentage of initial options to gain information about the range of choices available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Selection Phase**: After this phase, picking the first option that is better than all previously seen options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

The calculation of this optimal stopping point (S) involves maximizing the probability function `S/N * natural log(N/S)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. By setting the derivative to zero, it's found that `S/N = 1/e`, which is approximately 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.

Therefore, the strategy dictates exploring and rejecting the first 37% of options to understand the landscape, then selecting the first option encountered that surpasses all previous ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. Using this method, the chance of success (picking the best option) is also approximately 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. This rule can apply to decisions over time, such as spending the first 3.7 years of a 10-year period observing potential partners before selecting the next best one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.

## Cultural and Personal Significance

The prominence of 37 extends beyond psychology and mathematics into various cultural contexts:

*   **Magic Tricks**: There is a professional magic trick called "The 37 Force" that relies on an audience member reliably picking 37 "out of thin air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Hacker Slang**: The famous Stanford MIT Jargon File, a source of hacker slang, identifies 37 as the random number of choice for computer programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Individual Obsession**: One individual has dedicated his life to collecting instances of the number 37, maintaining a "37 Website" since 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. He started collecting in the 1980s after hearing a comedy routine by Charles Fleischer, which listed purported coincidences involving 37, such as 37 holes in a telephone speaker or Shakespeare writing 37 plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The number 37 holds a unique place in human perception of randomness. It is humanity's go-to random number, a prominent prime, and an ideal number for making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. This suggests that people subconsciously recognize its significance, gravitating towards it naturally because it "feels right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.

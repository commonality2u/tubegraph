From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The Blackbird is a unique wind-powered vehicle designed to travel directly downwind faster than the wind itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This counterintuitive claim states that the vehicle operates without any internal motor, batteries, or other energy source besides the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The $10,000 Bet

The operational principle of the [[blackbird_propeller_vehicle_mechanics | Blackbird]] vehicle became the subject of a $10,000 bet between the video's host and Professor Alex Kusenko, a [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | physics]] professor at UCLA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Professor Kusenko doubted the vehicle's ability to maintain speeds faster than the wind it was being pushed by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The wager and related discussions were made public, with Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, and Sean Carroll serving as witnesses to the signing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Professor Kusenko's Objections

Professor Kusenko presented several arguments challenging the vehicle's claimed performance:

*   **Gusts and Inertia**: He suggested that the vehicle achieved high speeds due to an initial strong wind gust. When the wind speed subsequently dropped, the car would momentarily appear to move faster than the wind, but it would be slowing down due to inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. He posited that whenever the velocity of the vehicle exceeded the wind speed, its acceleration would be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Wind Gradient**: Kusenko pointed out that wind speed varies with height due to interactions with the ground, moving slower closer to the ground and faster higher up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The wind in the video was measured at about 1 to 1.5 meters high, while the propeller extended to about 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He estimated that the wind at the propeller's height could be 10-15% higher than at the lower tell-tale, suggesting the car might appear faster than the wind at the tell-tale level while actually being slower at the propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Treadmill Test Doubts**: Treadmill tests, which simulate a steady tailwind by moving the ground backward in still air, were performed to demonstrate the vehicle's capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Kusenko argued that fluctuating treadmill speeds or unconscious steering biases introduced by a human operator could lead to desired results that weren't truly representative of the vehicle's inherent capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Theoretical Analysis Issues**: Kusenko identified a potential "divide by zero" problem in theoretical equations for net force, where the difference between car speed and wind speed in the denominator could imply infinite force when the car travels exactly at wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. His own analysis found no such issue, but concluded that the car could not accelerate at or above wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. He maintained that the acceleration of the craft would be negative when moving faster than the wind, making it impossible to maintain constant speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Evidence Supporting Blackbird's Operation

To address Professor Kusenko's points and provide definitive evidence, the following was presented:

### Addressing Gusts and Gradient

*   **Higher Tell-tales**: To counter the wind gradient argument, the [[blackbird_propeller_vehicle_mechanics | Blackbird]] was tested with tell-tales mounted on fishing poles to the sides and even above the propeller. While the lowest tell-tale flipped back first, *all* tell-tales eventually flipped backward, indicating that every part of the vehicle was moving faster than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Consistent Acceleration**: Analysis of video footage using the rotation of the back wheel showed that the car continued to accelerate even after the tell-tale flipped backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Furthermore, the tell-tale consistently pointed straight back for over 30 seconds before the driver had to brake to avoid crashing, suggesting sustained speed rather than momentary gust effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Record Speed Data**: When [[blackbird_propeller_vehicle_mechanics | Blackbird]] set its record speed of 27.7 miles per hour in a 10-mile-per-hour tailwind, it was still accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This was confirmed by multiple GPS units in the car and wind speed measurements taken at the propeller's height in various locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Academic Endorsement

The U.S. [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | Physics]] Olympiad Semifinal Exam in 2013 included questions about the [[blackbird_propeller_vehicle_mechanics | Blackbird]], asking if it could go faster than the wind both downwind and upwind. The solution stated that both modes are possible, and with sufficiently low energy loss, "any speed is possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

## [[blackbird_propeller_vehicle_mechanics | Blackbird]]'s Operational Principles

The core mechanism of the [[how_bicycles_work | Blackbird]] is based on a unique interaction between the ground and the air, acting like a mechanical lever or pulley system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Propeller Function

Unlike a typical windmill, the propeller on the [[blackbird_propeller_vehicle_mechanics | Blackbird]] does not turn in the direction the tailwind is pushing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Instead, it turns in the *opposite* direction, functioning as a fan that pushes air backward, thereby generating forward thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Power Transfer

The fan (propeller) is powered by the vehicle's wheels, which are connected to the propeller by a bike chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Even when the car is moving at wind speed, the wheels continue to turn the fan, which blows air backward, generating forward thrust and allowing the car to accelerate further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

The key to its operation lies in the difference in speeds:
*   **Power In at Wheels**: The ground moves backward relative to the car at the car's speed. The power input from the ground on the wheels is `Force (ground on wheels) × Velocity (car)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Power Out at Propeller**: The propeller pushes air backward. The power output from the prop on the air is `Force (prop on air) × Relative Velocity (car speed - wind speed)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This relative velocity is smaller because of the tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

Assuming no losses, the power input at the wheels equals the power output at the propeller. Since the propeller is moving through the air at a *slower relative speed* (car speed minus wind speed) compared to the wheels moving over the ground (car speed), a *larger force* can be generated by the propeller than the backward force experienced by the wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This effectively means the thrust force from the propeller is greater than the opposing force on the wheels, leading to net forward acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Lever Analogy

The [[blackbird_propeller_vehicle_mechanics | Blackbird]] operates similarly to a lever or pulley system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. A small force applied to the wheels over a larger distance (the ground moving under the car) allows the propeller to apply a larger force over a smaller distance (relative to the air) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This is analogous to how a bicycle rider going uphill can move the pedals fast with less force to make the wheels move slower but with more force on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Resolving the Divide by Zero Problem

The theoretical "divide by zero" issue, where an infinite force might be implied when the car's speed equals the wind speed, is addressed by two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>:
1.  **Lever Analogy**: Theoretically, a lever with one arm of zero displacement can lift an infinite weight, though its own displacement would be zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
2.  **Propeller Efficiency Term**: In practice, a propeller efficiency term resolves this, as it is ill-defined when the propeller is not moving through the air. A more comprehensive formula for propeller efficiency, though algebraically complex, is well-defined in the zero speed limit and eliminates the divide-by-zero problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Demonstrations and Replications

### Cart with Spools Analogy

A simplified model consisting of a cart with a large wheel rolling on two smaller spools demonstrates the principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. When a board is pushed to the right, the cart moves down the board faster than the board itself. The large wheel rotates in the opposite direction of the board's push, just like the [[blackbird_propeller_vehicle_mechanics | Blackbird]]'s propeller pushing back against the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This illustrates how an object in contact with two media moving relative to one another can move faster than their relative velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### Model Replications

Despite initial failures, YouTube maker Xyla Foxlin successfully designed and built a working model of a downwind cart. Her fourth version of the cart worked spectacularly on a treadmill and can be replicated using a 3D printer and simple materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Historical Context

The concept of a vehicle traveling faster than the wind downwind is not new. In 1969, Andrew Bauer built the first successful downwind cart to settle a wager with Aero Engineer Apolo Smith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This bet was inspired by a student paper from 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Rick Cavallaro, the builder of [[blackbird_propeller_vehicle_mechanics | Blackbird]], was unaware of this history until after he built his cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Other analyses on similar vehicles have been published under names like the "push-me pull-you boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Bet

Following the presentation of overwhelming evidence, Professor Kusenko conceded the bet and transferred $10,000, acknowledging the validity of [[blackbird_propeller_vehicle_mechanics | Blackbird]]'s operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This public debate served as an opportunity for learning and a deeper understanding of [[physics_of_windpowered_vehicles | physics of wind-powered vehicles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

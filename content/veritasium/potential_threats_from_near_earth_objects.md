Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids that have orbits bringing them close to Earth. These objects pose a significant threat, with Stephen Hawking considering an asteroid impact the greatest threat to life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

## The Chelyabinsk Incident (2013)

On February 15, 2013, an asteroid heavier than the Eiffel Tower slammed into Earth's atmosphere over [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_impact | Chelyabinsk]], Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The asteroid, approximately 20 meters in diameter, exploded 30 kilometers above the ground with a force brighter than the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Ninety seconds after the blast, a shockwave hit, damaging thousands of buildings and injuring 1,500 people, many from glass shards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

Embarrassingly, scientists had predicted a close fly-by of a similar-sized asteroid, Duende, on the very same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Duende came within 27,000 kilometers of Earth's surface 16 hours after the [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_impact | Chelyabinsk]] event, closer than geosynchronous satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. However, the [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_impact | Chelyabinsk]] asteroid itself was completely missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Asteroid Origin and Composition

Asteroids are leftover debris from the formation of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. As rocks and dust clumped into molten protoplanets, heavy elements like iron, nickel, and iridium sank to the core, leaving lighter silicate minerals on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Many protoplanets collided, breaking into pieces that continued to orbit the sun and smash into smaller fragments, becoming the asteroids we know today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

This origin explains why some asteroids are rocky "rubble piles" – loose conglomerates of gravel-sized rocks – while others, from the cores of shattered planetesimals, are mostly metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Most asteroids maintain stable orbits in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, but some, like NEOs, have moved closer to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Detecting Asteroids

Despite advanced technology and numerous telescopes, [[detection_challenges_of_asteroids | detecting asteroids]] before they hit Earth remains difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Since 1988, over 1,200 asteroids larger than a meter have collided with Earth, but only five were detected before impact, never with more than a day's warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

Reasons for [[detection_challenges_of_asteroids | detection challenges]] include:
*   **Size**: Asteroids range from meters to kilometers, making them small dots in the vastness of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Even small ones, like the 20-meter [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_impact | Chelyabinsk]] meteor, can cause significant damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   **Darkness**: Asteroids are rough and dark, reflecting only about 15% of the light that hits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
*   **Opposition Effect**: The best chance to spot asteroids is when they are fully illuminated by the sun, typically in the 45 degrees of sky directly opposite the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This "opposition effect" means asteroids approaching from the direction of the sun, like the [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_impact | Chelyabinsk]] asteroid, are difficult to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Orbital Prediction Limits**: Even with perfect observations, it's hard to predict an asteroid's path far into the future due to the gravitational influence of planets and "dynamical chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. Accurate predictions are limited to about 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

Currently, one million asteroids have been cataloged, with 24,000 identified as near-Earth objects requiring close monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## Consequences of Asteroid Impacts

### Barringer Crater
Barringer Crater in Arizona, formed 50,000 years ago by a 50-meter asteroid impact, demonstrates the explosive nature of high-speed collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. The impactor released energy equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT (over 600 times the Hiroshima bomb), completely vaporizing itself upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. This phenomenon was misunderstood for decades, leading mining engineer Daniel Barringer to spend 27 years futilely drilling for the metallic meteorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

### Dinosaur Extinction Event
The extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago was caused by a 10-kilometer asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. An impactor of this critical size delivers so much energy that it has global effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. The impact launches vast amounts of debris into sub-orbital trajectories, which then falls back to Earth worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. This re-entry phenomenon lights up the sky, turning it into a "red, hot glow" and effectively cooking everything on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. Only animals living underground or in water had a chance of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

## Probability of Future Impacts

*   **10-kilometer asteroids**: The probability of a 10-kilometer impact (like the K-T extinction event) is about one in a hundred million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. However, current knowledge indicates there are no 10-kilometer impactors with a path intersecting Earth for the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. Therefore, the chance of dying from such an event in one's lifetime is effectively zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.
*   **1-2 kilometer asteroids**: For every 10-kilometer asteroid, there are roughly a thousand 1-kilometer asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. These are still capable of causing "local, but massive damage," equivalent to obliterating a country like France or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. Scientists believe 90-98% of these bodies have been identified, and their orbits allow for reasonable predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.
*   **Hundreds of meters**: The greatest remaining threat comes from asteroids a few hundred meters in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. Many of these have not yet been detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. A 100-meter projectile is large enough to destroy a major city, causing city-wide fires and throwing up high-speed ejecta that would obliterate a 100-kilometer zone around the impact site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. Such an event "could happen tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.

## Mitigation Strategies

Currently, there are no effective [[strategies_for_asteroid_deflection | strategies for asteroid deflection]] for large impactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. Proposed methods have significant drawbacks:
*   **Bombing**: Detonating a bomb on or within an asteroid would likely cause it to break into fragments that would then be pulled back together by gravity, reforming as a rubble pile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.
*   **Rocket Nudging**: Attaching a rocket to an asteroid to gently push it off course would require the rockets to remain attached for centuries to have a significant effect, which is currently beyond our capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
*   **Laser Ablation**: Boiling the asteroid's surface with a laser to create thrust requires lasers far more powerful than currently exist or can be practically deployed to an asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.
*   **Wrapping in Foil**: Wrapping an asteroid in aluminum foil to change its radiative properties and nudge its orbit is an unproven concept lacking any feasible deployment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

In summary, there is currently no way to [[strategies_for_asteroid_deflection | deflect]] a kilometer-sized asteroid, let alone a 10-kilometer one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.

Even the most basic idea of [[safety_and_risks_of_falling_objects_in_urban_environments | city evacuations]] for a predicted impact faces severe logistical challenges. Millions of people attempting to use limited freeways would cause instant gridlock, preventing escape from the target zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

Therefore, the most viable approach currently is to prioritize **detection and monitoring** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. This involves conducting surveys, building telescopes, and deploying space telescopes to better understand the asteroid threat. Once a particularly dangerous object is identified, focused efforts can then begin on developing and implementing deflection methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.

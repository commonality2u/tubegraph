Fluid flow can generally be categorized into two main types: laminar flow and turbulent flow. While [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | physics and aerodynamic principles]] govern both, they exhibit distinct behaviors and properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## Laminar Flow

[[Laminar flow]] is characterized by fluid particles moving parallel to each other in organized layers, also known as laminae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is often described as pretty and well-behaved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Destin from Smarter Every Day is noted for his appreciation of laminar flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Laminar flow typically occurs under specific conditions and is limited to low speeds, small sizes, or highly viscous fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. A notable application of laminar flow is in decorative fountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

## Turbulent Flow

In contrast to laminar flow, [[turbulent flow]] is a complex and often unpredictable phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. There isn't even a universally agreed-upon definition for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. However, it is pervasive in everyday life and across vast scales in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

### [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | Characteristics of Turbulent Flow]]

Scientists have developed a checklist of [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | characteristics of turbulent flow]] to identify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>:

*   **Unpredictable and Chaotic**
    Turbulent flow is messy and unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. It is definitionally chaotic, meaning it is sensitively dependent on initial conditions; a slight change in the fluid can completely alter its final state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This unpredictability means that predictions can only be made statistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. The Navier-Stokes equations, which govern all fluid flow including turbulence, are notoriously difficult to solve, with a million-dollar prize offered for progress in understanding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

*   **Consists of Eddies or Vortices**
    One of the defining characteristics of turbulent flow is that it consists of many interacting swirls of fluid, also called eddies or vortices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. These eddies span a huge range of sizes, from micrometers in room air to meters in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
    *   **Scale of Eddies**:
        *   Air in a room: Micrometer to meter scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
        *   Surface of the Sun: Hot plasma rises in huge convection currents, with cell-like structures roughly the size of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
        *   Jupiter: The Great Red Spot is a vortex larger than Earth, and the planet's surface is covered in eddies of all sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
        *   Interstellar dust: Exhibits turbulent motion, causing radio sources to twinkle similarly to how atmospheric turbulence causes stars to twinkle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The Orion Nebula is a stunning example of this turbulent dust, spanning twenty-four light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

*   **Diffusive**
    Turbulent flow is diffusive, meaning it mixes things together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. It causes substances like dye, heat, or momentum to spread out and become distributed throughout the fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

*   **Dissipative**
    Turbulence is dissipative, meaning it gradually dies away if not sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. It takes in energy at the largest scales (big eddies), transfers that energy down to smaller and smaller eddies, until on the smallest scales, the energy is dissipated as heat into the fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Therefore, maintaining turbulence requires a constant source of energy to generate large eddies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

### Transition to Turbulence: [[reynolds_number_and_fluid_dynamics | Reynolds Number]]

The transition from laminar to turbulent flow was experimentally shown in 1883 by Osborne Reynolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. In his experiment, he passed water through a glass pipe with a stream of dye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   At low flow rates, the dye remained in a steady stream (laminar flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   As the flow rate increased, the dye began to oscillate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   Beyond a certain critical point, the dye became completely diffused throughout the pipe, indicating turbulent flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

Reynolds found that this transition depended on the flow rate, pipe width, and fluid viscosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. He calculated a dimensionless quantity, now called the [[reynolds_number_and_fluid_dynamics | Reynolds number]], which determines when turbulence occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
> $Re = \frac{\text{Velocity} \times \text{Characteristic Length (e.g., pipe diameter)}}{\text{Kinematic Viscosity}}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>

High [[reynolds_number_and_fluid_dynamics | Reynolds numbers]] result in turbulent flow, while laminar flow only occurs at low [[reynolds_number_and_fluid_dynamics | Reynolds numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. This explains why most fluid flow in everyday life is turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Examples include smoke rising from a candle flame transitioning from laminar to turbulent as it accelerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, air in and out of human lungs, blood pumping through the aorta, and the atmosphere near Earth's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

### [[applications_of_turbulent_flow_in_technology_and_nature | Applications of Turbulent Flow in Technology and Nature]]

Despite its complexity, turbulent flow is crucial and can be harnessed for various [[applications_of_turbulent_flow_in_technology_and_nature | applications in technology and nature]].

*   **Formation of Raindrops**
    Modeling shows that turbulent flow plays an essential role in the formation of raindrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Turbulence literally makes it rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

*   **Interaction with Objects and Boundary Layers**
    Turbulence frequently occurs around objects moving through a fluid, such as planes, cars, or boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. A **boundary layer** is the region near a surface where fluid velocity adjusts from zero (due to friction and adhesion) to the free-stream velocity away from the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. The force the surface applies to the fluid to form this layer results in an equal and opposite force on the surface, known as **skin friction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Drag and Smooth Surfaces**: If fluid velocity is fast or the surface is long, the boundary layer can transition to turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. A turbulent boundary layer causes fluid to swirl and mix, bringing faster-flowing fluid closer to the surface, which *increases* skin friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. This results in significantly more drag than laminar boundary layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
        *   For vehicles like planes and large ships, skin friction accounts for the majority of the drag they experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
        *   Small obstacles or rough surfaces can trip laminar boundary layers into becoming turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Therefore, clean, smooth surfaces can significantly reduce drag and save fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. This is why planes are frequently washed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

    *   **Induced Turbulence for Benefit**: In some cases, inducing turbulence is beneficial.
        *   **Aircraft Wings and Vortex Generators**: While smooth surfaces are generally preferred, aircraft wings often feature ridges or small fins called **vortex generators** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. These intentionally induce turbulence in the airflow over the wing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.
            *   At low speeds or high angles of attack, airflow can separate from the wing, leading to a condition known as **stall**, which dramatically decreases lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
            *   Vortex generators cause turbulence that mixes faster-flowing air from higher up down closer to the wing's surface, energizing the fluid flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. This higher-energy flow is able to follow the wing's surface for longer, maintaining attached airflow and lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. Inducing turbulence allows planes to fly more efficiently and climb at higher angles of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

        *   **Golf Balls and Dimples**: Golf balls have dimples to create a turbulent boundary layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.
            *   A smooth golf ball forms a laminar boundary layer with low skin friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. However, this laminar flow separates easily, creating a large wake of low-pressure turbulent air behind the ball, which leads to significant **pressure drag** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
            *   Dimples force the boundary layer to become turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. This turbulent boundary layer can stay attached further around the golf ball before separating, which reduces the size of the turbulent wake and significantly decreases pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. This reduction in pressure drag outweighs the increased skin friction, allowing the golf ball to travel much further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. The drag coefficient can drop by almost a factor of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

*   **Harnessing Energy from Turbulent Wakes**
    Scientists are also exploring ways to harness the energy contained in turbulent wakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Von Karman Vortex Street**: When fluid flows around an object, vortices can be shed periodically from alternating sides of the object, forming a predictable pattern downstream known as a von Karman Vortex Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. This phenomenon, while not strictly turbulent due to its predictability, is part of the transition to turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. These patterns are observed at various scales, from laboratory experiments with cylinders to cloud formations around islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Fish Swimming**: Experiments have shown that a dead fish placed in the wake of an object will swim upstream, suggesting that fish can take advantage of turbulent water to swim more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. This is an example of how animals have adapted to live in a turbulent world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Turbulence is ubiquitous, existing inside and around us, from the smallest scales to the largest structures in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>. It is essential for various processes, including flying airplanes efficiently, forming raindrops, making golf balls fly further, and even helping fish swim upstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>. While laminar flow appeals to a desire for order, the world, much like turbulence, is messy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>. Turbulent flow, with its richness and unpredictability, is a fundamentally awesome and beautiful phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.

The world contains mysterious places observable from high above using Google Earth, such as electric blue ponds in the Utah desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These "technicolor pools" are not part of a top-secret NASA experiment or large swimming pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Instead, they are filled with [[the_historical_impact_of_potash_on_industry_and_technology | something prized throughout human history]]: potash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## What is Potash?
Potash is a crystalline substance that has been one of the most important chemicals made by people for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Its name comes from its traditional method of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
*   **Traditional Recipe**: A 1,500-year-old recipe involves burning hardwood for its ash, then adding the ash to a pot with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The water-soluble chemical compounds dissolve, and after straining the solids, the solution feels slippery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Evaporating the water in the sun leaves behind the crystalline substance known as potash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Chemical Composition**: Originally, the term "potash" referred to potassium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. However, it has become a catchall term for various potassium-containing compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Discovery of Potassium
In 1807, British [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | scientist]] Humphry Davy conducted an experiment with damp potash (which was potassium hydroxide) and electrodes connected to a battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. He observed the formation of tiny metal globules that spontaneously caught fire as they burst through the potash crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Davy had discovered a new element, which he named pot-ash-ium, or potassium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Properties of Potassium
Pure elemental [[the_chemical_properties_and_reactions_of_potassium | potassium]] is a metal so soft it can be squished with fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It is highly reactive and must be created in a lab, as it will react with anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It is typically kept submerged under oil to prevent reaction with atmospheric water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Reaction with Water**: When potassium reacts with water, it forms potassium hydroxide and hydrogen gas, releasing a significant amount of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The hot hydrogen gas then spontaneously combusts upon contact with the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Reactivity Explained**: Potassium's high reactivity stems from having only one electron in its outermost shell, which is easily removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, explaining why metallic potassium is never found naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Historical Uses of Potash
Potash has played a crucial role in various industries throughout history:
*   **Soap Manufacturing**: For centuries, potash was combined with animal fat (like bacon grease) to create a primitive liquid soap through a chemical reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Glass Production**: Adding potash to sand (silicon dioxide), the primary component of glass, reduces the melting point, making the glass less brittle and easier to work with in early furnaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Gunpowder and Fireworks**: By adding bat guano or manure to a potash solution, crystals of potassium nitrate (also known as saltpeter) are formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Saltpeter is a core ingredient in fireworks and gunpowder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, infusing gunpowder used in muskets and cannons during historical conflicts like the American Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Potash in Early America
Potash was the primary chemical product of the early American colonies and a significant source of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. By 1788, Massachusetts alone had 250 potash works where wood was burned on a massive scale for its ash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The demand was so high that it led to the decimation of forests across Europe and the eastern U.S., as a huge amount of lumber was required to produce a small quantity of potash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. In 1790, the newly independent U.S. government issued its first patent for an improved process for making potash, signed by President George Washington himself, underscoring its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Modern Potash: From Rock to Fertilizer
The source of [[the_historical_impact_of_potash_on_industry_and_technology | potash]] changed in 1861 when Germany began producing potassium from rock, specifically potassium chloride in its natural mineral form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This discovery established Germany's near monopoly on the potash supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | Potash's Role in Agriculture]]
With an abundance of potash, Germany explored new uses and found that sprinkling it on farmers' fields made it an excellent fertilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Potassium, along with nitrogen and phosphorus, helps crops grow significantly larger and more drought-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This led to countries becoming dependent on potassium for feeding their growing populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. In 1910, just before World War I, Germany cut off potash exports, leading the U.S. to appropriate money in 1911 to find domestic sources, discovering sites near Searles Lake, California; Carlsbad, New Mexico; and Moab, Utah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### [[mining_and_extraction_techniques_for_potash | Mining and Extraction Techniques]]
Initially, potash rocks deep underground were mined like coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. The potash is found in the Paradox Formation, created by an inland ocean that repeatedly retreated and returned, leaving behind salt and evaporites like potash as water evaporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Salt, being lighter than rock, actively pushes up against the earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

*   **1963 Moab Explosion**: In 1963, during potash mining in Moab, Utah, miners hit a pocket of gas, causing a major explosion on August 27, 1963, resulting in 18 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The disaster was attributed to the ignition of combustible gas by electric arcs, sparks, or open flames from miners' tools or lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Davy Lamp**: To prevent such explosions, Sir Humphry Davy, the [[the_chemical_properties_and_reactions_of_potassium | discoverer of potassium]], also invented the Davy lamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This ingenious lamp uses a wire mesh to rapidly disperse heat from the flame, preventing the ignition of gas outside the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Solution Mining**: A safer way to mine potash was discovered in 1964 by a Canadian mining company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This method involves pumping water from the Colorado River 3,900 feet underground to the potash deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The water dissolves the potash salt, creating a brine solution that is then forced back to the surface and pumped into large ponds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

### Evaporation Ponds in Utah
The distinct blue ponds in the Utah desert are these evaporation ponds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. The hot Utah sun and dry air evaporate the water, leaving behind the potash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Process**: There are 23 ponds spanning 400 acres, with each taking months to evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Once the water is gone, a white crystalline substance (the potash) is left and scraped up by vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
*   **Coloration**: The ponds' colors change over time. Fresh ponds are deep blue, becoming seafoam green as water evaporates and shallower, eventually turning tan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. The blue color is due to copper sulfate added to the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Copper sulfate prevents algae growth and other living organisms, and its dark blue color absorbs more sunlight, speeding up water evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Economic Value**: The Paradox Basin alone contains 2 billion tons of potash, with an average price of $330 per metric ton, indicating billions of dollars in potential revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Global Importance of Potash
[[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | Fertilizer]], including potash, now supports half of the world's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. These innovations in harvesting potash and other essential minerals for food growth have significantly increased the efficiency of food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This efficiency allows humans to support more people and frees up time for individuals to pursue other ways of life beyond just finding food, such as art, music, sports, and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Potash is considered irreplaceable and has contributed significantly to shaping the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

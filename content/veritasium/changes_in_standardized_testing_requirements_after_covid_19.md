The landscape of standardized testing requirements for college admissions in the United States has seen significant shifts, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. After COVID-19, nearly 80% of undergraduate colleges in the U.S. no longer require any standardized testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

## Historical Context of the SAT

For decades, the [[challenges_in_standardized_testing | SAT]] was considered the primary exam every student needed to take for college admission in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It held a reputation for determining students' entire futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. A newspaper from the era underscored this sentiment, stating:
> "If you mess up on your SAT tests, you can forget it. Your life as a productive citizen is over. Hang it up, son." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

This historical emphasis highlights the significance of the recent changes.

[[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | Kinetic energy weapons]], also known as "Rods from God," are a frequent subject in science fiction, appearing in numerous movies, video games, and books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This concept explores the devastating potential of objects impacting targets at extreme velocities.

## Origins of the Concept
The idea for a space-based kinetic weapon originated in the late 1950s with Boeing researcher Jerry Pournelle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. His concept, called Project Thor, envisioned placing telephone pole-sized pieces of tungsten in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These rods could be dropped on any Earth location, reaching a target in as little as 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. On impact, they would be traveling at approximately Mach 10 (three kilometers per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The destructive power of such a weapon was compared to the MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast) or "Mother of All Bombs," one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. A single tungsten rod was theorized to possess kinetic energy equivalent to 11 tons of TNT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Unlike conventional explosives, these rods contain no explosive material; their destructive force comes solely from their mass and extreme velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This principle is demonstrated by the circular craters on the moon, formed by the explosive [[kinetic_energy_weapons_and_their_capabilities | kinetic energy]] of impacting asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Appeal in Fiction
The concept holds significant appeal in science fiction due to several characteristics:
*   **Destructive Power**: A Rod from God can destroy targets buried up to 30 meters underground, like missile silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Precision**: The localized nature of the impact, due to the high speed and penetration, allows for precise "surgical strikes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **No Radioactive Fallout**: Unlike nuclear weapons, kinetic weapons do not produce radioactive fallout, bypassing certain international laws and ethical concerns within fictional narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. International agreements on space weapons only prohibit nuclear weapons in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Realism and Feasibility Challenges
Despite their common appearance in fiction, the practical feasibility of Rods from God in reality faces significant challenges, which often leads to them remaining a fictional concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>:

### Aiming and Control
*   **Hypersonic Speeds**: Aiming an object traveling at hypersonic speeds is incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Communication Issues**: Communicating with a re-entering rod from the ground or space would be nearly impossible due to the superheated plasma surrounding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control**: Practical experiments dropping large weights from a helicopter demonstrated the extreme difficulty in hitting targets, even at much lower altitudes and speeds, due to factors like wind and swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Aerodynamics**: While rods are an aerodynamic shape to minimize [[role_of_air_resistance_in_projectile_motion | drag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, objects like cylinders tend to fall on their sides, making accurate targeting challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Orbital Mechanics and Response Time
*   **Geostationary Orbit**: Placing a rod in geostationary orbit (over 35,000 kilometers away) would mean it would take several hours to fall to Earth, far exceeding the desired 15-minute response time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Low Earth Orbit**: In low Earth orbit (around 350 kilometers), a rod would move relative to the ground, completing a revolution every 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. This means the time between ordering a strike and impact could be up to an hour and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.
*   **Constellation Size**: To ensure a rod is always near a target, hundreds of satellites would be required due to Earth's rotation and orbital drift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

### Cost and Maintenance
*   **Launch Costs**: Launching even a hundred 10-ton rods into space would cost billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Maintenance**: Thruster breakdowns and malfunctions would lead to significant ongoing maintenance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   **Defense Systems**: A global defense system, specifically designed to intercept missiles during their boost phase, would require hundreds of rods spread across multiple orbits and cost hundreds of billions of dollars, potentially half of the US military's annual budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. Even then, such a system could be evaded by launching multiple missiles simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

## Kinetic Weapons in Literature
The creator of the Rods from God concept, Jerry Pournelle, later became a science fiction writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. In his 1985 *New York Times* bestselling novel, *Footfall*, an alien race utilizes [[historical_and_modern_use_of_falling_objects_as_weapons | kinetic weapons]] to invade Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. This highlights how the concept, while facing considerable real-world challenges, thrives in fictional narratives where such limitations can be circumvented or ignored for dramatic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

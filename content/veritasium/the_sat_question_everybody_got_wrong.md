From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

In 1982, a specific SAT question stumped every single student who took the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This unique outcome was not due to the question's difficulty, but rather a fundamental error made by the test writers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The Problem Question

The question, identified as number 17, presented a geometric scenario:
"In the figure above, the radius of circle A is 1/3 the radius of circle B. Starting from the position shown in the figure, circle A rolls around circle B. At the end of how many revolutions of circle A will the center of the circle first reach its starting point?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>

The options provided were A) 3/2, B) three, C) six, D) 9/2, or E) nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Initial Intuition

Most students, including the video's narrator, intuitively chose option B, "three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The reasoning stemmed from the circumference formula (2πr): if the radius of circle B is three times that of circle A, its circumference would also be three times larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Logically, it seemed it should take three full rotations of circle A to roll around circle B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## The Mistake Revealed

The intuitive answer of "three" was incorrect, as were all other listed options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The reason no one answered correctly was that the test writers themselves believed the answer was three, so the actual correct answer was not provided as an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Only three out of 300,000 test takers, Shivan Kartha, Bruce Taub, and Doug Jungreis, identified and wrote to the College Board about the error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. These students confidently asserted that the question was wrong and proved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## The Coin Rotation Paradox

The core of the problem lies in the **coin rotation paradox**, a counterintuitive phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Demonstrating the Paradox

Consider two identical coins, which have the same circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Intuitively, one might expect one coin to rotate once as it rolls around the other. However, when demonstrated, the rolling coin completes a full rotation by the halfway point and two full rotations by the time it returns to its starting position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Even though the coins are the same size, the outer coin rotates twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Applying to the SAT Question

This paradox directly applies to SAT question 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Using a to-scale model of the circles (where circle B's radius is three times circle A's radius), rolling circle A around circle B reveals it rotates a total of four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This means the circle rotates one more time than initially expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The additional rotation occurs because Circle A is not just rolling its own circumference; it is also moving around the circular path of Circle B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The circular path itself contributes an additional rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The general solution is to find the ratio between the circumferences of circle B and circle A, and then add one rotation to account for the circular path traveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Alternative Perspectives and Ambiguity

The problem's wording introduced significant ambiguity, leading to other plausible answers depending on interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

*   **Perspective from Circle B:** If one counts rotations from the perspective of circle B looking out at circle A, circle A appears to rotate only three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This perspective is akin to unwrapping the circular path into a straight line, where the additional "external observer" rotation is not counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Astronomical Definition of Revolution:** The question asks for "revolutions." In astronomy, a "revolution" is precisely defined as a complete orbit around another body, separate from an object rotating about its own axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. By this strict definition, circle A only revolves around circle B once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Formal Proof

Mathematician Doug Jungreis, one of the students who identified the error, provided a formal proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

The amount a small circle rotates is always equal to the distance its center travels, assuming it rolls without slipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This is because the speed at which the small circle turns is the same as the speed its center is moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Therefore, the total distance the center travels is the same as the total amount it turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

In this problem, the center of the small circle travels around a circle of radius 4 (since the large circle has radius 3, and the small circle has radius 1, making the path of the center of the small circle a radius of 3+1=4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The total distance the center moves is 8π (2πr, where r=4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Since the small circle has a circumference of 2π (radius 1), it rotates four times (8π / 2π = 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

This general principle extends:
*   When a circle rolls continuously *around* a shape, the distance traveled by its center is the perimeter of the shape plus the circle's own circumference, resulting in N+1 rotations (where N is the ratio of circumferences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   When a circle rolls continuously *within* a shape, the distance traveled by its center decreases by one circumference, resulting in N-1 rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   When a circle rolls along a *flat line*, the distance traveled by its center equals the length of the line, resulting in N rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Real-World Application: Astronomy

This mathematical principle is crucial in astronomy for accurate timekeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

*   **Solar vs. Sidereal Time:** When people count 365.24 days in a year, they are counting from the perspective of Earth (a solar day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. However, to an external observer, Earth performs one extra rotation to account for its circular path around the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This means an external observer would count 366.24 days in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This is called a **Sidereal year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   A normal solar day is the time it takes for the sun to be directly overhead again (approximately 24 hours), but the Earth must rotate more than 360 degrees due to its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. A Sidereal day is the time it takes for a distant star to be directly overhead again, which requires exactly 360 degrees of rotation and is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   The difference between a solar and sidereal day accounts for the "extra" day in a Sidereal year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. While solar time is practical for daily life on Earth, astronomers use Sidereal time for telescopes and geostationary satellites to ensure consistent observation of specific regions of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

After reviewing the students' letters, the College Board publicly admitted its mistake and nullified question 17 for all test takers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### [[impact_of_question_errors_on_standardized_tests | Impact of the Error]]

The rescoring process cost the testing service over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. More significantly, it caused students' scores to shift by up to 10 points out of 800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. While seemingly small, this 10-point change could affect a student's educational opportunities, particularly for universities or scholarships with strict cutoff scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### [[role_of_standardized_tests_like_the_sat_in_college_admissions | The Changing Role of the SAT]]

The SAT, once considered paramount for college admissions in the US, has seen its role diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. After the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly 80% of undergraduate colleges in the US no longer require standardized testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. However, the experience of correcting the 1982 error proved beneficial for some students involved, including Doug Jungreis, who went on to become a mathematician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

The incident highlights the importance of hands-on exploration and critical thinking to understand seemingly simple phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

A significant factor contributing to an individual's success is the country they are born into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31">[02:31]</a>. Approximately half of the variation in income globally can be attributed to a person's country of residence and its income distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36">[02:36]</a>.

## Impact of Country of Birth
Being born into a prosperous country is considered a crucial stroke of [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | luck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31">[02:31]</a>. For instance, in a country like Burundi, with one of the world's lowest gross national incomes per capita ($730 a year), an individual's potential earnings are severely limited, regardless of their intelligence or diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43">[02:43]</a>.

## Societal Structures and Public Services
The infrastructure and public services of a country, developed by previous generations, represent a collective form of [[historical_impacts_and_their_consequences | historical impacts and their consequences]] that benefit current citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22">[08:22]</a>. These include:
*   Roads and schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26">[08:26]</a>
*   Public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27">[08:27]</a>
*   Emergency services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27">[08:27]</a>
*   Clean air and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28">[08:28]</a>
These elements contribute to the circumstances that make success possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40">[08:40]</a>.

## Perception of Success by Those in Power
People in positions of power, such as business leaders and politicians, are often talented and hard-working, but they have also benefited from more [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | luck]] than most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31">[07:31]</a>. However, like many people, they may not fully recognize their own good fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35">[07:35]</a>. This oversight can lead to a distorted perception of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41">[07:41]</a>.

Leaders may develop a form of survivor bias, where their personal experience of success through hard work leads them to believe the world is inherently fair and rewards effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44">[07:44]</a>. They lack the experience of those who worked hard but did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55">[07:55]</a>. This can lead to the conclusion that less successful individuals are simply less talented or less diligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00">[08:00]</a>. This perspective, influenced by [[egocentric_bias_and_self_overestimation | egocentric bias]], can make them less inclined to be generous or to "give back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08">[08:08]</a>, despite being the ones who often set societal rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12">[08:12]</a>.

### Psychological Effects of Ignoring Luck
Ignoring the [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | role of luck]] can lead to a belief that one is in full control of their destiny, which, paradoxically, may improve the probability of success by encouraging greater effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19">[05:19]</a>. However, this [[psychological_effects_of_acknowledging_or_ignoring_luck | psychological effect of ignoring luck]] can also make it easier to justify one's societal position, wealth, or power by attributing it solely to intelligence, effort, and perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50">[05:50]</a>, thereby making inequality seem more acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00">[06:00]</a>.

Research indicates that individuals who attribute their success primarily to personal qualities tend to be less generous than those who acknowledge external factors beyond their control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15">[07:15]</a>.

## Benefits of Acknowledging Luck
Acknowledging fortunate circumstances aligns individuals more closely with reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47">[08:47]</a> and can lead to increased likeability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52">[08:52]</a>. A study showed that an entrepreneur who credited [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | luck]] for their company's success was perceived as kinder and more approachable than one who took sole credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14">[09:14]</a>.

Raising awareness of fortunate events can also foster gratitude, which contributes to greater happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23">[09:23]</a>.

## Paradoxical Advice for Success
To navigate success in a world where [[the_interplay_between_skill_hard_work_and_luck | skill, hard work, and luck]] all play a role, the advice is paradoxical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31">[10:31]</a>:
1.  **Believe in self-control**: One must believe they are in complete control of their destiny and that success is solely due to their talent and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34">[10:34]</a>. This serves as a "useful delusion" to maintain motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32">[05:32]</a>.
2.  **Acknowledge luck**: Simultaneously, it is crucial to understand that this belief is not entirely true for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43">[10:43]</a>. If success is achieved, remember that [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | luck]] played a significant role, and leverage that good fortune to help increase the luck of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48">[10:48]</a>.

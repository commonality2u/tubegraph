Dr. [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] is known as "the snowflake guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. He served as the snowflake consultant for the movie "Frozen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and his pictures have been used by the US Post Office for snowflake stamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ken has also authored books on snowflakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Lab Snowflake Creation Process

Creating snowflakes in the lab begins by turning on 2000 volts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process involves using needles with tips around a hundred nanometers in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] refers to the snowflakes he creates as "designer snowflakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> because he designs them on the fly, by hand, making each one unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

To grow a snowflake, it starts at a certain temperature, for example, -13 Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. To encourage the growth of branches, the temperature can be lowered to -15 Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, and the humidity, or super saturation, can be increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Changing these conditions can cause a plate to stop growing and then start forming branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

A key aspect of the process is that only a small nub of the snowflake touches the sapphire substrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>; the rest grows above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Airflow is increased, and droplets form, which kicks the growth "into gear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The humidity can then be turned down to zero, causing droplets to recede and the snowflake to stop growing and start to facet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. If branches are desired again, a lot of moisture can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

[[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] states that he can predict the future with his snowflakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, as he understands the conditions well enough to make specific growth happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Comparison to Natural Snowflakes

[[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] believes his lab-grown snowflakes are "better than nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> because their facets are sharp and crisp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Natural snowflakes, by the time they are collected and examined, often show signs of evaporation, dulling their edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The first close-up photograph of a snowflake in the wild was taken in 1885 by American meteorologist Wilson A. Bentley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Bentley originated the idea that no two snowflakes are alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> and took over 5,000 photos of snowflakes during his lifetime, published in his book "Snow Crystals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. However, Bentley only selected snowflakes in pristine condition with uncommon beauty and symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. In reality, finding such perfect natural snowflakes is difficult, described as "one in a million" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Creating Identical Twin Snowflakes

While natural snowflakes are unique, in the lab, it is theoretically possible to create almost identical snowflakes due to controlled conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] has achieved this by growing two snowflakes next to one another, calling them "identical twin snowflakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. While not exactly the same, they are clearly more alike than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

The process involves placing seed crystals, referred to as "sparkly snow crystals," onto a sapphire disc within a cold chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The crystals waft onto the disc and ideally stay there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. If growing too close together, twin snowflakes will compete for moisture, stunting their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

[[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] views the question "Is it really true that no two snowflakes are alike?" as silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, stating that anything with complexity will be different from everything else because there are an uncountable number of ways to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## Scientific Understanding and Motivation

The [[types_and_structures_of_snowflakes | types and structures of snowflakes]] formed depend on temperature and super saturation, summarized in the Nakaya Diagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This diagram shows patterns like plates forming around -2 Celsius, columns and needles at -5 Celsius, plates again at -15 Celsius, and columns and plates below -20 Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] has built his own version of this chart from his experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

The diagram helps understand a snowflake's history; for instance, capped columns are often produced when a cloud moves up and gets colder, making columns first, then branches and plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The intricate symmetry of a snowflake is due to all sides growing under the exact same conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Different snowflakes, however, experience unique conditions, leading to their unique forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

A long-standing mystery, essentially since Nakaya's diagram in the 1930s, has been *why* ice crystals form this wayâ€”why the alternating patterns of plates and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]]'s hypothesis is that the nucleation barriers, which dictate how easily new layers can form on crystal facets, vary with facet size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. He proposes that narrow basal facets have a dip in their nucleation barrier around -4 Celsius, and narrow prism facets have a dip at -15 Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. This hypothesis aligns with the observed [[types_and_structures_of_snowflakes | different forms of snowflakes]] at various temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Experiments conducted by Ken show results that agree with this hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. This research may finally explain the molecular physics behind the diverse shapes of snowflakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

[[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]]'s motivation for studying snowflakes stems from a desire to understand something fundamental that is not yet known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. He wants to be the scientist who figures out how snowflakes work <a class="yt>timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

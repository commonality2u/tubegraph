Potassium is an incredibly reactive chemical element that plays a vital role in various aspects of life and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Its name, "potassium," is derived from [[the_history_and_importance_of_potash | potash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Discovery of Potassium
In 1807, British scientist Humphry Davy discovered potassium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. He achieved this by placing electrodes into damp [[the_history_and_importance_of_potash | potash]] (specifically, potassium hydroxide) and connecting them to a battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Davy observed the formation of tiny metal globules that spontaneously caught fire as they burst through the [[the_history_and_importance_of_potash | potash]] crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. He named the new element "pot-ash-ium," or potassium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## Elemental Potassium: Properties and Reactivity
Pure elemental potassium is not found in nature because of its extreme reactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. It must be created in a laboratory setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

*   **Physical Properties**: It is a metal, yet it is soft enough to be squished with fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Reactivity**: Potassium is an incredibly reactive substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. This high reactivity is due to having only one electron in its outermost shell, which is easily removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **Storage**: Due to its reactivity, pure potassium is stored submerged under oil to prevent it from reacting with water in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

## Reaction with Water
When potassium comes into contact with water, it undergoes a vigorous reaction:
*   Potassium reacts with water to form potassium hydroxide and hydrogen gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   This reaction also releases a significant amount of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   The hot hydrogen gas produced spontaneously combusts when it hits the atmosphere, leading to explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

## Potassium Compounds
While elemental potassium is highly unstable, various potassium-containing compounds are crucial:
*   **Potassium Carbonate**: This was the chemical compound originally referred to as [[the_history_and_importance_of_potash | potash]], derived from wood ash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Potassium Hydroxide**: This was the form of [[the_history_and_importance_of_potash | potash]] Humphry Davy used to isolate elemental potassium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
*   **Potassium Chloride**: Found in natural mineral form, this compound is now also referred to as [[the_history_and_importance_of_potash | potash]] and is a primary source for fertilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   **Potassium Nitrate (Saltpeter)**: Formed by adding bat guano or manure to a [[the_history_and_importance_of_potash | potash]] solution, it is a core ingredient in fireworks and gunpowder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

Sir Humphry Davy, the discoverer of potassium, also invented the Davy lamp, an ingenious device that prevents explosions in mines by dispersing heat from a flame quickly enough to prevent igniting combustible gases like methane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

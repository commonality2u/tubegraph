The Navy's Indoor Ocean at Carderock is the world's largest wave pool, used for testing scale model ships before they are deployed on the open ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This facility allows engineers to make ships better by observing their behavior in controlled, reproducible wave conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Indoor Ocean Facility

The facility measures 360 feet long in one dimension and 240 feet long in another, with a depth of 20 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Its size is comparable to a football field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The dome covering the pool was, for a period, the largest free-standing dome in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Wave Generation and Control
The pool features 216 individual wave makers, which are huge paddles lining two walls of the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These paddles are programmed to move in precisely choreographed ways to produce reproducible waves of specific amplitude and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This level of control is what sets this facility apart from other wave pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The angular motion of the paddles is achieved using air bellows, and force transducers measure the forces involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Wave Physics Demonstrated
The facility is ideal for observing wave properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>:
*   **Wavelength and Energy Transmission**: Waves primarily transmit energy, not material, from one place to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Water molecules move in circular paths, with motion decreasing with depth. All motion stops at a depth equal to half the wavelength, known as the wave base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Drift**: Even in ideal water waves, molecules drift slightly in the direction of wave motion because they travel faster higher up in their circular path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Frequency and Speed**: Waves with higher frequencies travel slower than low-frequency waves, as long as the water is deeper than the wave base. Wave speed is inversely proportional to its frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Principle of Superposition**: When waves meet, their heights add together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This can be used to create:
    *   **Breaking Waves**: By sending high-frequency waves followed by lower-frequency waves, engineers can time their convergence at a specific point, causing a large breaking wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
    *   **Standing Waves**: Two regular waves traveling towards each other can create a "quilt wave" pattern where some areas have zero amplitude (cancellation) and others have maximum amplitude (addition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   **Bullseye Wave**: Waves sent from all directions can channel energy into one spot, creating a spherical wave that breaks due to its height exceeding one-seventh of its wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Rogue Waves**: Often mistakenly thought to appear out of nowhere, rogue waves are typically the result of multiple waves meeting and superimposing, creating an amplitude much larger than individual waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Testing Ship Models for [[navy_ship_testing_facilities | Naval Applications]]

The primary purpose of the facility is to replicate ocean conditions for testing ship models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Model Scaling**: To accurately represent real-world conditions, scaling is crucial. The Froude number, which measures the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces, is used for scaling wave dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. For a model ship hull 46 times smaller than the real thing, it must travel at one over the square root of 46 times its real-world speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Footage from the model is slowed down by a factor of the square root of 46 (approx. 6.8 times) to match the full-size ship's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Water Conditions**: The pool uses fresh water, which requires adjustments when ballasting models to account for the greater buoyancy of salty ocean water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Test Methods**:
    *   **Free-running models**: Models are run on "race tracks" (circles or figure eights) to understand their behavior at different headings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
    *   **Tethered models**: Models that cannot carry their own power and instrumentation are tethered to a large carriage that tows them across the waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Test Parameters**: Engineers evaluate how different designs behave in specific wave conditions. A key parameter is deck wetness, especially for areas like helicopter landing pads, where water on deck is a significant safety concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Simulating Diverse Ocean Conditions

The pool can create various wave conditions encountered globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Wave Formation**: Most ocean waves are wind-created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Five factors affect wave size and shape: wind speed, wind duration, fetch (distance over which wind acts), fetch width, and water depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Swell vs. Wind Waves**:
    *   **Swell**: High-frequency waves dissipate energy faster, so waves traveling long distances from a storm are typically fast-moving, low-frequency waves called swell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. While visible on calm beaches, swell is generally not a concern for ships in the open ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
    *   **Wind Waves**: Formed in three steps:
        1.  Turbulent air creates tiny ripples (around 1 cm wavelength) on still water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
        2.  Wind acts on these ripples, creating larger pressure differences that pull them into bigger waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
        3.  Continued wind interaction leads to even larger pressure differences and waves, which then break, dissipating kinetic energy as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. A "fully developed sea" is reached when energy dissipation matches energy input from the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Ocean Spectra**: Different oceans have distinct mixtures of wave frequencies (spectra) due to geography and storm types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>:
    *   **North Sea / Small Bodies of Water**: Have a "peakier" spectrum due to limited storm fetch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
    *   **Mid-Atlantic**: A broader spectrum describes developing or decaying open ocean waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
    *   **North Atlantic**: Steady wind across open ocean produces the broadest spectrum of wind waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## [[Innovations in ship design | Ongoing Innovations in Ship Design]]

Ship design is continuously evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Model testing at facilities like Carderock is critical for cost-effectively validating new ideas before building full-scale vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Every ship in the Navy's fleet has undergone testing or review at this facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

One example of modern innovation is the **tumble home hull design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Unlike traditional ships with outwardly flared hulls that provide restoring force when rolling, a tumble home hull is shaped in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. While this reduces restoring force, it offers advantages related to above-water signatures, such as improved stealth and radar cross-section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. The continuous drive for stealthier, faster, and more powerful ships fuels these innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

This behind-the-scenes engineering work significantly impacts every ship and submarine in the fleet, often without the direct awareness of the sailors operating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

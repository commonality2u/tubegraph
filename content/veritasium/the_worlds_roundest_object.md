The "world's roundest object" is a 1-kilogram sphere made of silicon-28 atoms, numbering approximately 2.15 x 10^25 [00:00:22]. It is considered priceless [00:00:56], despite its raw material costing 1 million Euros [00:00:47]. Only a handful of people, besides its creators, have ever held it [00:00:41]. Its surface feels "absolutely incredible" [00:00:36].

To illustrate its extreme roundness, an analogy is made: if this [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon]] sphere were the size of Earth, the difference between its highest "mountain" and lowest "valley" would be only about 14 meters [00:01:09].

## The Purpose: Redefining the Kilogram

The significant investment of 1 million Euros and thousands of man-hours into perfecting this pure, polished [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon]] sphere stems from a critical need to redefine the base unit of mass, the kilogram [00:01:22], [00:06:52].

### A Brief History of the Kilogram

The original name for the base unit of mass in the metric system (which evolved into the Système International d'Unités, or SI units) was the "grave" [00:01:38]. In 1793, a commission including Antoine Lavoisier defined the "grave" as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting temperature of ice, essentially a liter of ice water [00:01:43], [00:01:56]. The name "grave" originated from the Latin word `gravitas`, meaning weight [00:02:01].

However, the name was short-lived because it sounded too similar to the aristocratic title "graf" [00:02:07]. Amidst the French Revolution's cry for equality, having a unit that sounded noble was unacceptable [00:02:12], [00:02:17]. Notably, Lavoisier was guillotined, not for his scientific contributions, but for collecting taxes as a nobleman [00:02:23].

The new republican government also deemed the "grave" too large for common measurements, leading to the adoption of the "gramme," a thousandth of a "grave" [00:02:37], [00:02:41]. Soon after, realizing the gram was too small, they reverted to the "grave" concept but, unable to use the name, invented the "kilogram" – a thousand grams [00:02:47], [00:02:51]. This historical progression is why the kilogram is the only one of the seven base SI units to have a prefix in its name [00:02:57].

In 1799, the kilogram's definition was refined to be the mass of a liter of water at 4 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which water is densest [00:03:04], [00:03:10]. However, water proved an impractical standard for mass [00:03:16].

### The International Prototype Kilogram (Le Grand K)

To address the limitations of water as a standard, a pure platinum cylinder was created to match the mass of the water definition. This artifact was named the "Kilogram of the Archives" [00:03:22]. By definition, this physical object *became* the kilogram [00:03:33].

Ninety years later, in 1889, this standard was upgraded to a more durable platinum-iridium alloy cylinder [00:03:39], [00:03:46]. This cylinder, officially known as the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) and affectionately called "Le Grand K" or "Big K," remains the official definition of the kilogram to this day [00:03:51], [00:03:58].

Le Grand K is stored under three bell jars, alongside six "sister kilograms," in a climate-controlled vault secured by three independently controlled keys in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris [00:04:20]. It is uniquely the only object in the entire universe with a mass of *exactly* one kilogram because "it IS the kilogram" [00:04:06], [00:04:13]. Furthermore, it is the only SI unit still defined by a physical object [00:04:17].

#### The Problem with a Physical Standard

The reliance on a physical object for the kilogram's definition presents significant problems:
*   **Mass Divergence:** When 40 identical replicas of Big K (with known mass offsets) were created and distributed globally as national standards [00:04:56], [00:05:06], inconsistencies emerged. During a reunion in 1948, their masses were found to have diverged [00:05:12], [00:05:20]. Even Big K's mass differed from its sister cylinders [00:05:24], [00:05:31]. By a later reunion 40 years later, the divergence had increased to about 50 micrograms, roughly the weight of a fingerprint [00:05:36], [00:05:41].
*   **Instability:** Despite careful washing before weigh-ins, indicating fingerprints were not the cause [00:05:47], a physical process caused the mass changes [00:05:51]. This demonstrates that the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time [00:06:04], which is a critical flaw for a base unit [00:06:10].
*   **Widespread Impact:** This instability affects four of the seven base SI units, as well as many derived units like Newtons, Joules, Volts, and Watts [00:06:13], [00:06:20]. Even the avoirdupois pound in countries like Liberia, Burma, and the US is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms, meaning it is also tied to Big K's fluctuations [00:06:25], [00:06:35], [00:06:42].

## The [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | Silicon]] Sphere's Solution

The [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon]] sphere offers a way to redefine the kilogram independent of a physical object [00:06:52], [00:07:09]. Instead of a physical reference, the goal is to define the kilogram by a concept: the precise count of atoms [00:07:11].

### Sphere Design and Manufacturing

The sphere is a perfect crystal of pure [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon]], specifically containing only one isotope: [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon-28]] [00:07:34], [00:07:37]. This isotopic purity explains the high cost of the raw material [00:07:40]. A sphere is chosen because its simple geometry allows its entire dimension to be characterized by knowing only its diameter [00:07:43], [00:07:49].

The manufacturing process begins with an oversized sphere, about two millimeters larger in diameter [00:08:02], [00:08:08]. It is then progressively ground finer and finer using abrasives, effectively "massaging atoms" to control the shape at an atomic level [00:08:08], [00:08:16], [00:08:21].

### Measurement and Redefinition

After creation, the sphere's diameter is measured with extreme accuracy using lasers. The sphere is placed in the center of a cavity, and a laser measures the gap on both sides [00:08:25], [00:08:31], [00:08:37]. Knowing the diameter allows for the precise determination of its volume [00:08:39]. Since the atom spacing in [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon]] is known to high precision, the total number of atoms in the sphere can be calculated [00:08:44].

This method allows for the redefinition of Avogadro's constant. Currently, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram, representing the number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon-12 [00:08:49], [00:08:55], [00:09:01]. Using the [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon]] sphere, the number of [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon]] atoms in the sphere would fix Avogadro's constant, which would then, in turn, define the kilogram [00:09:05].

Under this new definition, the kilogram would be defined by a concept, such as "the mass of 2.15 x 10^25 [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon-28]] atoms" [00:09:20], [00:09:26]. This means that even if the physical [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon]] spheres were lost or damaged, the definition of the kilogram would remain unaffected [00:09:10].

### Complementary Approaches and Future Outlook

Another approach to redefining the kilogram involves fixing Planck's constant using a Watt Balance [00:09:39], [00:09:45]. These two methods, the [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon]] sphere and the Watt Balance, are complementary, providing checks on each other [00:09:45], [00:09:52]. If they show good agreement and can reduce their uncertainties to approximately 20 micrograms, the kilogram could be redefined as early as 2014 [00:09:56], [00:09:59]. This would finally make the kilogram an unchanging unit, no longer dependent on a physical object in a vault [00:10:03].

### Historical Accuracy Revisited

The original intention was for the kilogram to be the mass of a liter of water at its densest temperature [00:10:29]. A liter of water at nearly four degrees Celsius has a mass of 999.975 grams [00:10:36], [00:10:43]. This means the kilogram is slightly heavier than its original water definition [00:10:50]. However, considering the technology available 214 years ago, scientists were remarkably accurate, creating an artifact correct within the margin of error of a grain of rice [00:10:57].

It is worth noting that Antoine Lavoisier, who was involved in the initial definition of mass, also conceived of [[silicon_spheres_and_atomic_precision | silicon]] as an element in 1787 [00:11:20], [00:11:29], [00:11:34]. He has truly been involved in the kilogram's definition "from cradle to grave" [00:11:39].

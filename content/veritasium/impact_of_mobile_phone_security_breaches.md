Modern mobile phone security breaches, particularly those targeting the [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | Signaling System No. 7 (SS7)]] protocol, allow attackers to remotely intercept phone calls and text messages, steal two-factor authentication passcodes, and pinpoint a target's location without touching their device or sending any direct communication to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## A Brief [[history_of_phone_system_hacks | History of Phone System Hacks]]

Before the widespread adoption of modern digital protocols, phone networks had different vulnerabilities that were exploited by early hackers, known as "phreakers".

### The "Blue Box" Era

In the 1970s, long-distance phone calls were very expensive, costing up to $25 a minute when adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, prior to founding Apple, created a device called a "blue box" to hack the telephone network, allowing them to make free long-distance calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

This was possible because early automated phone systems used in-band signaling, where control signals (like dialing pulses or tones) traveled over the same line as the voice audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. The blue box exploited a vulnerability in how central nodes communicated with remote nodes to determine if a line was free: by checking for a 2600 Hertz tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. By mimicking this tone (sometimes even with a toy whistle from a Cap'n Crunch cereal box), hackers could trick the network into thinking a call was disconnected, then send new control tones to connect to any long-distance number for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

### Introduction of SS7

To address these vulnerabilities, telephone companies introduced [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | Signaling System No. 7 (SS7)]] in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. SS7 uses a separate digital line to carry control signals, meaning that tones sent down the voice line no longer control how a call is connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

## Modern [[exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_phone_systems | Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Phone Systems]]: SS7 Attacks

Despite being introduced for security, [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] has its own vulnerabilities that can be exploited for malicious purposes, including:

1.  **Infiltrate SS7**: Access to the global SS7 network is achieved through various means, such as buying access from one of the thousands of operators who participate in the network, some of whom can be bribed or hacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. A single SS7 connection can cost a few thousand dollars per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Gain Trust**: To uniquely identify and target a phone, attackers need the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), a unique 15-digit identifier belonging to the SIM card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. This can be collected by sending specific SS7 messages like "send routing info" or "send routing info for SM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.
3.  **Attack**: Once the IMSI is obtained, various attacks can be launched.

### Interception of Phone Calls

Attackers can trick the network into thinking the target's phone is roaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. This allows them to rewrite the number being called to a number they control, effectively rerouting the call to themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. The target's phone will not ring, and they will be unaware of the intercepted call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. In more sophisticated scenarios, the attacker can act as a middleman, rerouting the call to themselves, then simultaneously dialing the real number for the target, allowing them to record the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.

### Interception of Text Messages and Two-Factor Authentication

Similar to call interception, attackers can trick the network into thinking the target is roaming, rerouting their SMS messages to the attacker's Global Title (GT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>. This allows them to steal one-time passwords (OTPs) used in SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>. This type of attack works until the target interacts with their phone network, at which point the phone reconnects to the correct GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. This brief window is enough to steal the OTP and gain access to accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

SMS 2FA is commonly used as a default, and sometimes the only, authentication option, even for sensitive accounts like bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.

### Location Tracking

Attackers can use the IMSI number to send a command to the switching center where the target's device is connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. This command, routinely used for legitimate purposes like call routing or emergency services, can be leveraged to track a target's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. SS7 location requests identify the cell tower the target is connected to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. In urban areas with many towers, this can pinpoint a location to within a hundred meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>.

## Real-World Consequences of SS7 Exploits

The consequences of [[exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_phone_systems | exploiting vulnerabilities in phone systems]] via SS7 attacks can be severe:

*   **Political Espionage and Abduction**: Princess Latifa of Dubai's escape attempt in 2018 is a documented case where SS7 attacks were used to pinpoint the location of her yacht captain, leading to her abduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. Attacks involved leasing multiple Global Titles (GTs) in different countries and sending numerous IMSI and location requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:00">[22:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>.
*   **Surveillance of VIPs**: In 2016, security researchers demonstrated tracking US Congressman Ted Lieu using this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. Experts have also found instances where 20-30 VIPs, including a country's chief of cybersecurity, were constantly under surveillance via SS7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Fraud**: Criminals have used SS7 to intercept SMS 2FA codes and steal millions of dollars from bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>.
*   **Integration with Advanced Spyware**: Firms like NSO Group, known for their Pegasus spyware, acquired an SS7 tracking company in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>. SS7 can be used to gather basic data like device type and software version to aid in launching more costly "zero-click" hacks that gain complete access to targeted phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>.

Millions of malicious SS7 requests are sent each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a>.

## Why SS7 Remains Vulnerable and in Use

When SS7 was introduced in the 1980s, the telecommunications landscape was dominated by a few large, reputable operators with established relationships, fostering a "walled garden" approach to network security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

However, the landscape has changed dramatically. There are now over 1,200 operators and 4,500 networks, many needing SS7 access for virtual network operators or mass-text services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. Not all of these new players are trustworthy, leading to thousands of ways to access SS7 at reasonable effort or cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

Despite the exposure of vulnerabilities by security researchers in 2014, SS7 remains the backbone of 2G and 3G communications globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:03:00">[27:03:00]</a>. Phasing out 2G and 3G is difficult due to reliance from devices like mandatory emergency call buttons in EU cars, which use 2G and 3G SIM cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20:00">[27:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>. Even with 5G signaling protocols offering better security, SS7 remains the de facto standard for routing calls between networks, creating "tremendous inertia" against moving to newer, more secure systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>. It could be another 10-20 years until SS7 networks are finally switched off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:35:00">[28:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a>.

## [[steps_individuals_can_take_to_protect_against_ss7_attacks | Steps Individuals Can Take to Protect Against SS7 Attacks]]

While there is not much individuals can do about location tracking if they have a SIM card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>, there are steps to mitigate other risks:

*   **Avoid SMS-based Two-Factor Authentication**: Choose alternatives like Authenticator apps or hardware tokens to prevent message interception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:00">[29:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:18:00">[29:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.
*   **Use Encrypted Internet-Based Calling Services**: For protection against phone tapping, use services like Signal or WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:22:00">[29:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>.

While these attacks are often targeted at "people of interest" to state agencies, SS7 vulnerabilities represent a significant privacy intrusion with millions of abuse cases monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:34:00">[29:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:00">[29:38:00]</a>.

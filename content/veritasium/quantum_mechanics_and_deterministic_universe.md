## Quantum Mechanics and the Deterministic Universe

Classical mechanics posits a deterministic universe, where knowing a system's initial state (like a particle's position and velocity) allows for precise future predictions using equations such as Newton's second law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] introduces complexities that challenge this deterministic view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### The Measurement Problem and Probabilities

In [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]], a particle's state is described by its [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]], which evolves smoothly and continuously according to the Schrödinger equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This evolution typically shows the particle spreading out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The fundamental challenge arises because, unlike this spread-out [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]], when a particle is measured, it is always found at a single, specific point in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The early founders of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum theory]] prioritized the observed measurement over the abstract [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While Erwin Schrödinger formulated his wave equation based on the idea that matter has wave-like properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, it was Max Born who proposed how to interpret the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Born suggested that squaring the complex amplitude of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] at any point in space gives the probability of finding the particle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This "Born rule" introduced probability into the core understanding of reality, moving away from a strictly deterministic universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This concept made many scientists, including Einstein, uncomfortable, but the Born rule remains central to [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] due to its success in predicting experimental outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

This led to the understanding that there are two sets of rules in [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]]:
*   When unobserved, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] evolves smoothly according to the Schrödinger equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   When a measurement is made, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] suddenly and irreversibly "collapses," and the probability of a specific outcome is determined by the squared amplitude of the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] associated with that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Schrödinger's Cat Thought Experiment

Erwin Schrödinger himself disliked this collapse formulation, which prompted him to devise the famous Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The experiment aims to magnify the quantum weirdness to a macroscopic, tangible level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>:
1.  A cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  A radiation detector is linked to a mechanism that releases poisonous cyanide gas if the atom decays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
3.  If the atom decays, the cat dies; if it doesn't decay, the cat lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

The key concept here is **entanglement**: the state of the cat and detector apparatus become directly tied to the state of the atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. According to [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]], the atom can be in a superposition of both decayed and not decayed states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This superposition then extends to the detector and the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Therefore, the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of everything inside the box suggests the cat is both alive and dead at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Only when the box is opened and a measurement is made does the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapse, and the cat becomes definitively either dead or alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Schrödinger's intent was not to highlight the weirdness of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]], but to demonstrate that its formulation (particularly the collapse postulate) was problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Re-evaluating Fundamental Concepts: Superposition, Entanglement, and Measurement

To find a more logical and consistent way to understand [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]], it's necessary to examine its three essential components: superposition, entanglement, and measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

*   **Superposition**: The idea that quantum objects can exist in multiple states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This is indirectly observed in experiments like the double-slit experiment, where individual electrons appear to pass through both slits at once, creating an interference pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This is easily understood if electrons are represented by waves (their [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave functions]]), which are inherently spread out in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Thus, superposition rests on solid ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

*   **Entanglement**: When two quantum particles interact, they become described by a single, shared [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]], even if physically separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. For example, if two electrons scatter, measuring the momentum of one instantly reveals the momentum of the other, preserving conservation laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This implies that measuring one instantaneously collapses the shared [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]], affecting the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Fundamentally, all of existence can be seen as described by a single [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

*   **Measurement**: This is the remaining component under scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The "measurement postulate" was added to bridge the gap between [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]]' mathematics and observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. However, it seems odd to have one set of rules for unobserved systems and another for observed ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. In reality, measurement is simply the interaction of one quantum system with another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### The [[manyworlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many-Worlds Interpretation]]

The [[manyworlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many-Worlds Interpretation]] (MWI), formulated by Hugh Everett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, proposes to discard the "measurement" rules, leaving only the continuous evolution of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave functions]] according to the Schrödinger equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

In this view, when an observer opens Schrödinger's box, there is no [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Instead, the observer (who is also a quantum mechanical system) becomes entangled with the state of everything inside the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This means the observer effectively sees both the cat alive and the cat dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The resolution lies in the idea that the "you" who saw the cat alive and the "you" who saw it dead inhabit separate, non-interacting realities or "worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This separation occurs due to **environmental decoherence**: when a quantum object in a superposition becomes entangled with its environment (e.g., air molecules, photons), the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of the universe branches, splitting into slightly different copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:10:02]</a>.

In the case of Schrödinger's cat, the radioactive atom's superposition entangles with the detector, which then entangles with the environment (air molecules, photons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This environmental decoherence causes the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] to branch *before* the observer even opens the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. At that moment, the observer is split into identical copies, each entangled with a different outcome, leading to one observer seeing a live cat and another seeing a dead one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

#### Implications of [[manyworlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many-Worlds]]

If MWI is true, the universe is constantly branching, potentially infinitely often, creating an infinite number of subtly different worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. While this may sound implausible, these worlds are a natural part of the mathematics of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Removing them requires introducing concepts like [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

MWI offers a cleaner and more elegant formalism, where reality is entirely described by continuously evolving [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave functions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This implies that the founders of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | quantum theory]] may have viewed reality backward: the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] is the complete picture, and our measurement is just a tiny fraction of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Crucially, MWI restores determinism to the universe: every outcome happens, 100% of the time, just in different branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Our experience is limited to our specific "sliver of the multiverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

#### Common Objections and Clarifications (Sean Carroll)

Sean Carroll, an expert on MWI, addresses common questions:

*   **Energy Conservation**: The energy of the *entire* [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of the universe is conserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The branching isn't about duplicating energy but subdividing a certain amount of the universe into pieces that appear identical from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

*   **Number and Frequency of Worlds**: The exact number is unknown (could be finite but huge, or infinite), but branching happens constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. For example, radioactive decay in one's own body (around 5,000 times per second) causes the universe to branch every time a nucleus decays or doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

*   **"Everything that could possibly happen happens"**: This is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. MWI means the [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] obeys the Schrödinger equation, which only allows certain events (e.g., an electron will never become a proton, violating conservation laws) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:15:16]</a>. The Schrödinger equation assigns zero probability to impossible events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. While a version of an individual might become president, it's a very low-amplitude (low-probability) world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

*   **Instantaneous Branching**: Whether branching happens instantly or spreads out at the speed of light is a matter of description, not observable reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Both descriptions yield the exact same predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This is because "branches" are a convenient human way to understand the complex, single [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | wave function]] of the universe; they are not fundamental to reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. It's akin to describing air by temperature and pressure rather than tracking every molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The idea of an infinite universe with infinite copies of ourselves, where various outcomes (like becoming president) are possible due to atomic shuffling, exists even outside of quantum mechanics and is not unique to MWI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

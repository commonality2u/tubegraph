Before the development of modern refrigerants, common gases used in refrigerators included methyl formate, which is highly toxic, and sulfur dioxide, which is flammable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Development of Freon
In 1928, engineer Thomas Midgley Jr. was tasked by General Motors (GM) to create a safer alternative to existing refrigerants for household appliances like fridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. Midgley developed dichlorodifluoromethane, a non-toxic and non-flammable refrigerant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. GM named this new product "Freon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. To demonstrate its safety, Midgley publicly inhaled a lung full of Freon and blew out a candle at the American Chemical Society unveiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

## Widespread Use and Environmental Consequences
In the decades following its invention, Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), such as Freon, became widely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. They were also utilized as solvents and in aerosols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

However, CFCs pose significant environmental problems because they are light and stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. When released into the atmosphere, CFC molecules rise into the stratosphere and can remain there for 50 to 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. If a CFC molecule is struck by an ultraviolet photon of specific energy, it breaks apart, releasing a chlorine atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. This chlorine atom then reacts with ozone, breaking it down into chlorine monoxide and oxygen gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

This process led to an [[environmental_impact_of_pfas_chemicals | environmental disaster]]: the hole in the ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. A depleted ozone layer allows more UV light to penetrate the atmosphere, increasing rates of skin cancer and cataracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Furthermore, CFCs are potent greenhouse gases, contributing 10,000 times more warming per kilogram than CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

The historian John McNeil noted that Midgley had "more impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

## Global Response and Recovery
In response to the growing environmental concerns, the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out CFCs, went into effect in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. As a result, the ozone layer is now showing signs of recovery, although full recovery is expected to take many more decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

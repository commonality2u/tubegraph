The Great Pyramid stood as the tallest man-made structure for nearly 4,000 years, only being surpassed by the Eiffel Tower in 1889, which was 147 meters high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These impressive structures were built over 4,500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Scale and Time
Each pyramid required approximately 2 million stones, or "giant rocks," weighing between 1.5 and 3 tons each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The construction of a single pyramid took about 20 to 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. To achieve this, stones would have needed to be laid roughly once every three minutes, considering a 10 to 12-hour workday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## [[myths_and_misconceptions_about_pyramid_builders | Myths and Misconceptions About Pyramid Builders]]
The exact methods of pyramid construction remain largely a secret, as no detailed plans survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This lack of clear historical accounts has led to countless conspiracy theories, including involvement of aliens, time travel, or lost technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

A widely accepted, though less far-fetched, myth is that the pyramids were built by slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, recent discoveries, including well-preserved tombs near the pyramids, suggest that the builders were skilled workers whose hard labor and sacrifice were rewarded with honorable burials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Slaves would not have received such dignified burials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Transport and Tools
The Egyptians did not have wheels or steel; the only metal available was copper and copper alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. They did not even use rollers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01">[02:02:01]</a>. Stones were likely transported across the desert on sleds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a>. To reduce friction, experiments show that wetting the sand in front of the sled could reduce the required pulling force by half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:20">[02:02:20]</a>.

### Materials
The internal structure of the pyramids was made of Limestone, a softer and easier stone to work with, which could be shaped with copper chisels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:29">[02:02:29]</a>. Some blocks may have been cut using copper saws combined with an abrasive like sand, which would wear away the stone despite copper's softness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:39">[02:02:39]</a>.

The exterior of the pyramids was covered with much harder granite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:09">[03:03:09]</a>. This granite was quarried in Aswan, nearly 1,000 kilometers away from Giza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:17">[03:03:17]</a>. During the annual Nile flood, water would reach the quarry, allowing the quarried stones to be floated on rafts back to Giza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:26">[03:03:26]</a>. Quarrying granite, one of the hardest rocks (containing quartz, a 7 on the hardness scale where diamond is a 10), was an extremely difficult task, often involving smashing dolerite rock into the granite, achieving only about 5 mm of progress per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:40">[03:03:40]</a>.

### Site Preparation
Before construction, the ground needed to be leveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:55">[02:02:55]</a>. It is speculated that floodwater from the Nile was channeled onto the site to identify high and low points, aiding in the leveling process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:02">[03:03:02]</a>.

### Lifting Stones
While no clear accounts exist, the best guess for raising stones is the use of ramps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:07">[04:04:07]</a>. Ramps have indeed been found at incomplete pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:13">[04:04:13]</a>. However, a single straight ramp would be impractical, as it would require more material than the pyramid itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:17">[04:04:17]</a>. A more likely theory suggests a ramp that wrapped around the pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:27">[04:04:27]</a>. For the top third of the pyramid, which only accounts for about 4% of the total material, levers were likely used to lift the final levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:30">[04:04:30]</a>.

While today the pyramids appear weathered, they were originally a brighter white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:43">[04:04:43]</a>. This was due to a casing of smooth white Limestone that covered the entire face of the pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:48">[04:04:48]</a>. The very top may have been capped with electrum, a natural alloy of gold and silver, creating a spectacular and shiny metallic apex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:54">[04:04:54]</a>.

The pyramid shape itself was designed to represent sun rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:02">[05:05:02]</a>. Imagine its initial appearance with a gleaming metallic top and smooth white sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:07">[05:05:07]</a>.

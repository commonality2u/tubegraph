The [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]], which causes rotating objects to deflect as they fly through the air, is well-known for its impact in sports like tennis, soccer, and golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36">[01:36]</a>. However, it also has potential and historical [[applications_of_the_magnus_effect | non-sport applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41">[01:41]</a>.

## Flettner Rotors on Ships

One notable [[applications_of_the_magnus_effect | non-sport application]] is the use of spinning cylinders, known as "Flettner rotors", on ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49">[01:49]</a>. These rotors replace traditional sails and use the [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] to deflect crosswinds, propelling the ship forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55">[01:55]</a>. An example of this technology in action is the E-Ship 1, which utilizes four Flettner rotors to enhance its efficiency and decrease diesel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25">[02:25]</a>.

## Experimental Aircraft Designs

The [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] has also been explored in aviation. One experimental aircraft was designed with spinning cylinders taking the place of wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00">[02:00]</a>. These cylinders were able to generate more lift than conventional wings by utilizing the [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04">[02:04]</a>. However, this design also produced significantly more drag, making it impractical; the plane only flew once before crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09">[02:09]</a>.

Despite this early setback, the [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] is seeing a resurgence in aircraft design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17">[02:17]</a>. An experimental rotor wing aircraft is currently being developed that generates all its lift from spinning cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19">[02:19]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] has the potential to aid more than just basketballs in flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35">[02:35]</a>.

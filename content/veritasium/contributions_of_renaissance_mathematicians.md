Mathematics in the Renaissance era aimed to quantify the world, including land measurement, planetary motion prediction, and commerce tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A significant challenge of the time was finding a general solution to the cubic equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Cubic Equation Challenge
In 1494, Luca Pacioli, who served as Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, published "Summa de Arithmetica," a comprehensive summary of contemporary mathematics in Renaissance Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Within this work, Pacioli concluded that a general solution to the cubic equation (ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0) was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This problem had eluded ancient civilizations for at least 4,000 years, including the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Persians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Ancient mathematicians often relied on geometric interpretations for solving problems, such as "completing the square" for quadratics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. However, this approach limited their understanding, as they often disregarded negative solutions because they didn't correspond to real-world quantities like lengths or areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This aversion led to multiple versions of equations (e.g., six for quadratics, nineteen for cubics by Omar Khayyam) to keep coefficients positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Breakthroughs in Solving the Cubic

### Scipione del Ferro
Around 1510, Scipione del Ferro, a mathematics professor at the University of Bologna, discovered a method to reliably solve "depressed cubics" (cubic equations with no X² term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. To maintain his job security in a competitive academic environment, del Ferro kept his solution a secret for nearly two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. He only revealed it to his student, Antonio Fior, on his deathbed in 1526 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia
Antonio Fior, boasting about his newfound knowledge, challenged Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia to a public math duel on February 12, 1535 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Tartaglia, a largely self-taught mathematician known as "Tartaglia" (stutterer) due to a childhood injury, was unaware of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

Knowing that a solution was possible due to Fior's boasts, Tartaglia independently developed his own method for solving the depressed cubic equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. He extended the "completing the square" concept into three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. His method allowed him to transform a cubic into a quadratic equation, which he could then solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

In the duel, Fior failed to solve any problems, while Tartaglia solved all 30 of Fior's depressed cubics in just two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Tartaglia summarized his algorithm as a poem, as modern algebraic notation did not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Gerolamo Cardano
Tartaglia's victory made him a celebrity, attracting the attention of polymath Gerolamo Cardano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Through persistent letters and promises, Cardano lured Tartaglia to Milan, where Tartaglia revealed his method on March 25, 1539, under a solemn oath of secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Cardano, driven to solve the full cubic equation (including the x² term), soon discovered a substitution (x - b/3a) that could transform any general cubic into a depressed cubic, making Tartaglia's formula applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Desiring to publish this monumental achievement, Cardano felt bound by his oath. However, in 1542, during a visit to Bologna, he saw del Ferro's original solution in an old notebook, which predated Tartaglia's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This discovery liberated Cardano from his oath.

Three years later, Cardano published "Ars Magna" (The Great Art), an updated compendium of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. He acknowledged the [[Contributions of notable mathematicians to perfect numbers | contributions]] of Tartaglia, del Ferro, and Fior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. To this day, the general solution to the cubic is often referred to as Cardano's method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## The Emergence of Imaginary Numbers
While writing "Ars Magna," Cardano encountered cubic equations whose solutions, when plugged into the algorithm, yielded square roots of negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. For example, x³ = 15x + 4. Though x=4 is a real solution, the cubic formula produced square roots of negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Cardano initially dismissed these as "as subtle as it is useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, as they led to "negative area" in geometric derivations, which made no sense in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Rafael Bombelli
Around a decade later, the Italian engineer Rafael Bombelli tackled this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Undeterred by the "impossible geometry," he posited that the square root of a negative could be its own new type of number, distinct from positive or negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Bombelli demonstrated that by treating these numbers as combinations of ordinary and this new type (involving the square root of negative one), the cube roots in Cardano's equation could simplify, allowing the "imaginary" parts to cancel out and yield the correct real solution (e.g., 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

This breakthrough showed that to solve certain real problems, mathematicians had to embrace an abstract concept that seemingly defied reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

> [!INFO] Transition to Modern Mathematics
> The work of these Renaissance mathematicians paved the way for modern algebra. In the 1600s, Francois Viete introduced modern symbolic notation for algebra, moving away from wordy descriptions and drawings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Rene Descartes popularized the use of "imaginary numbers" and gave them that name, with Euler later formalizing 'i' to represent the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. These "complex numbers" (combinations of regular and imaginary numbers) liberated algebra from the constraints of geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

Paradoxically, these imaginary numbers, born from the abstract need to solve cubics, later proved fundamental in [[History of Physics and Mathematics | physics]], notably in Erwin Schrödinger's 1925 wave equation describing quantum particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This demonstrated that abandoning a strict connection to observable reality in mathematics could lead to profound discoveries about reality's true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

Australia is home to numerous dangerous animals, notably snakes and spiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. At the Australian Reptile Park, snakes and spiders are "milked" for their venom, which is then used to produce antivenom to save lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Venom Room
The facility where venomous snakes are housed is described as "the most dangerous room in the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, with venomous snakes surrounding visitors from floor to ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The only barriers keeping the snakes contained are small locks and thin glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. A snake once thumped the glass hard enough to scare a child, causing them to run out of the room screaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Dangers of Snake Bites
A scratch from some species can be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Even a mere scratch can be very serious, leading to extensive medical care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

In Australia, 1 to 3 people die annually from snake bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates approximately 120,000 deaths per year due to snake bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Australia possesses some of the best antivenom products worldwide and has a federally funded antivenom program, providing free antivenom to anyone who needs it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

One bite from a King Cobra contains enough venom to kill around 13,000 mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, which translates to enough venom to kill approximately four human-sized rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The inland taipan, considered the most venomous snake in the world by one measure, has enough venom in one bite to kill half a million mice or over 100 humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Snake Milking Process
The process of milking snakes involves carefully pinning the snake and then allowing it to bite into a vial or shot glass to release its venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The snake's venom glands, located behind its eyes, are massaged to extract additional venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Placing the snake back into its enclosure is considered the most "sketchy" part, relying on who is quicker between the handler and the snake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

To make one vial of antivenom, approximately 15 snakes are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The Australian Reptile Park specifically breeds snakes to produce more venom than their wild counterparts through selective breeding, resulting in some coastal taipans producing five to seven times the amount of venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. These "super snakes" can yield 4.5 to 4.9 grams of venom per bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Understanding Snake Venom
[[evolutionary_aspects_of_snake_venom | Snake venom]] evolved from saliva and is primarily used for catching and digesting prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Each species has a unique venom tailored to its specific prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Originally, venom was squirted by back teeth, and almost two-thirds of all snakes remain rear-fanged today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The venom gland's location behind the snake's eye makes the shortest duct path directly downwards to the back of the top jaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Over time, evolutionary pressures led fangs to move to the front of the jaw, improving hunting efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Fangs also evolved from smooth teeth, with venom flowing externally, to grooved fangs, and eventually to hollow tubes that inject venom directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Only about one-seventh of the world's snakes have hollow fangs, though most venomous snakes in Australia possess them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

[[snake_venom_and_human_safety | Snake venom and human safety]] is compromised because humans are closely related to rodents, which are a main prey for many snakes, sharing similar biology in cells, blood clotting, and nerve signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Venoms typically target conserved molecular pathways found across vertebrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

Snake venom can kill through four main mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>:
*   **Neurotoxic**: Damages the nervous system and brain by interfering with neurotransmitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Hemotoxic**: Thins blood, prevents wound healing, and causes internal bleeding by disturbing blood coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Cytotoxic**: Attacks cells, leading to severe blisters, necrosis, and cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Myotoxic**: Destroys muscles and causes paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Most venoms are a complex combination of neurotoxic, hemotoxic, cytotoxic, and myotoxic proteins, with up to 200 compounds present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This complexity makes snake bites very challenging to treat, as dozens of toxins work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Antivenom Production
[[antivenom_production_process | Antivenom production process]] was inspired by observations in 1870 by British military doctor Edward Nicholson, who noted Burmese snake handlers deliberately exposing themselves to cobra bites, possibly to develop immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

In 1890, French researcher Albert Calmette explored making a vaccine for snake bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. He injected rabbits with increasing doses of cobra venom over eight months, eventually giving them 15 times the normal lethal dose, yet they remained healthy due to developed antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:12:09]</a>. Calmette then transferred immunity by isolating serum containing antibodies from a venom-resistant rabbit and injecting it into another rabbit, which then survived a lethal dose of venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This marked the creation of the first antivenom (or "antivenin") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Modern antivenoms are still produced similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>:
1.  Venom is collected and frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
2.  It is diluted and injected into a donor animal, typically a horse due to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
3.  Over months, increasing doses allow the horse to build immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
4.  Blood is drawn from the horse, plasma containing antibodies is isolated, and red blood cells are returned to the horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
5.  These horse antibodies constitute the life-saving antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Horse antibodies are effective in humans because they are similar to human antibodies, binding to and neutralizing toxic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. However, this method has downsides: venom collection is dangerous, many donor animals are involved, and some people are allergic to antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Scientists are researching producing antivenom using genetically modified bacteria to create specific antibodies for each toxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

## Risks to Handlers
A snake handler described a personal experience of receiving a scratch from a snake, resulting in a 36-hour ICU stay, with eight of those hours in a resuscitation bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This individual discovered a severe allergy to antivenom, leading to anaphylaxis that required repeated doses of adrenaline alongside antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The handler emphasizes that hands often tremble after a milking session, and the day that stops is the day they will quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Despite the significant risks, handlers are motivated by a love for the animals and the opportunity to actively contribute to saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

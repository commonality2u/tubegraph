Anamorphosis is a technique involving the creation of a distorted projection of an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. To perceive the object's proper proportions, it must be viewed from a specific position or with a particular device, such as a mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. This technique has been utilized by artists for centuries, possibly even millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

Anamorphosis is also central to illusions such as the [[ames_room_and_depth_perception | Ames Room]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

## Historical Examples

### The Ambassadors (1533)
Hans Holbein the Younger's 1533 painting, *The Ambassadors*, features two prominent figures alongside a distorted shape on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. When viewed from specific angles (top right or bottom left), this distorted shape reveals itself as a detailed depiction of a human skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. It is believed the painting was intended to be hung in a stairwell, allowing the skull to be spotted out of the corner of one's eye, serving as a memento mori <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. Viewing the painting head-on makes the skull difficult to discern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

### Leonardo's Eye
An earlier example is Leonardo da Vinci's *Leonardo's Eye*, which only takes its proper form when viewed from the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.

### Lascaux Cave Paintings
Some argue that the cave paintings at Lascaux, France, dating back 17,000 years, represent the earliest instances of anamorphic art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Due to the uneven surfaces of the cave, artists would have needed to consider how their animal figures would be perceived from various vantage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

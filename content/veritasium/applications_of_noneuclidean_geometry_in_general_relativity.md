[[einsteins_general_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]] fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe, integrating the principles of [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | non-Euclidean geometry]] to describe [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | gravity]] as the curvature of spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Einstein's Theory of Gravity

In 1905, Albert Einstein introduced the special theory of relativity, based on two postulates: the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, and the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This implied that space and time must be relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. This posed a challenge for Newtonian [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | gravity]], where the force of [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | gravity]] depends on distance, which is no longer well-defined in special relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

To reconcile relativity with [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | gravity]], Einstein had what he called "the happiest thought of his life" in 1907 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. He imagined a man falling from a roof, realizing that the man would feel weightless and objects released would remain in uniform motion relative to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. This state is identical to being in deep space, away from any masses, moving at a constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. Therefore, a free-falling man is an inertial observer, experiencing no acceleration or force of [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

### Gravity as Spacetime Curvature

This led to the breakthrough idea that if [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | gravity]] is not a force, then phenomena like the space station orbiting Earth must be explained differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Astronauts in orbit also feel weightless because they are traveling in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. The reason this "straight line" appears curved to a distant observer is that the spacetime it exists within is curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

Massive objects cause [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | spacetime curvature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Objects moving through this [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | curved spacetime]] follow the shortest possible paths, known as [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics | geodesics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. Thus, the curved appearance of orbits to a distant observer is due to Earth's curvature of spacetime around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This understanding, based on the behavior of straight lines in curved geometries, is central to how we comprehend our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

The mathematical framework for [[einsteins_general_theory_of_relativity | General Relativity]] was provided by the development of [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | non-Euclidean geometries]], particularly hyperbolic geometry by János Bolyai and Bernhard Riemann's groundwork for geometries where curvature can vary locally and extend to multiple dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami proved that hyperbolic and spherical geometries are as consistent as Euclidean geometry, meaning any inconsistencies in them would also exist in Euclidean geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Observational Evidence

Since its publication, [[einsteins_general_theory_of_relativity | the general theory of relativity]] has been remarkably successful, with countless findings supporting its predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

*   **Gravitational Lensing**: In 2014, astronomers observed a supernova that appeared in four different places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. This was explained by a massive galaxy situated between the supernova and Earth, which curved spacetime and caused light from the supernova to take several different paths to reach Earth, acting as a gravitational lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. After modeling, they successfully predicted a "replay" of the supernova a year later, which was observed on December 11, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This is a direct [[astronomical_observations_supporting_general_relativity | astronomical observation supporting general relativity]].
*   **Gravitational Waves**: We can also measure the ripples of spacetime itself, known as gravitational waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. These waves are formed by cosmic events, such as the merger of [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. A recent survey by NANOGrav suggests that the fabric of spacetime is constantly "buzzing" with remnants of grand cosmic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

## The Shape of the Universe

[[spacetime_curvature_and_the_shape_of_the_universe | Non-Euclidean geometries]] are also used to determine the overall [[spacetime_curvature_and_the_shape_of_the_universe | shape of the universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. The sum of angles in a triangle differs depending on the geometry:
*   **Flat geometry**: Angles add up to 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Spherical geometry**: Angles add up to more than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Hyperbolic geometry**: Angles add up to less than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

To determine the [[spacetime_curvature_and_the_shape_of_the_universe | shape of the universe]], astronomers measure the angles of cosmic triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. This is done by looking at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is the first light we can observe from when the universe was 380,000 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. By knowing the distance to the CMB and the expected size of variations in temperature and density (which originated from quantum fluctuations and expanded with the universe), a cosmic triangle can be formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

The Planck mission data shows that the universe is overwhelmingly flat, with a measured curvature of 0.0007 ± 0.0019, which is essentially zero within the margin of error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. This implies a very precise balance of mass-energy density in the universe, as even a slight deviation would result in a spherical or hyperbolic curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

The paradoxical and seemingly absurd geometries developed by mathematicians like Bolyai and Riemann are at the very heart of [[einsteins_general_theory_of_relativity | general relativity]], one of our best physical theories of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

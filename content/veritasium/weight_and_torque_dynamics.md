At the University of Sydney, a unique apparatus was constructed by the mechanical engineering shop: a 40-pound (19 kilogram) [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] attached to the end of a one-meter-long shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The objective was to demonstrate the surprising effects of [[historical_perspective_and_physics_behind_rotational_dynamics | rotational dynamics]] and torque.

## The Challenge

Initially, attempting to hold the 19-kilogram [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] and shaft horizontally with just one hand at the end was virtually impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Gyroscopic Precession in Action

The experiment involved spinning the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] up to a few thousand RPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Once spinning, the apparatus could be held horizontally with one hand, and surprisingly, the shaft remained horizontal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The spinning wheel appeared almost weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Instead of the weight of the wheel pulling it down as expected, it creates a torque that pushes the shaft around in a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This phenomenon is known as [[historical_perspective_and_physics_behind_rotational_dynamics | gyroscopic precession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Lifting the Spinning Flywheel

A more extreme challenge was attempted: lifting the spinning [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] over the head with one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Baseline Test

Before the attempt, it was confirmed that lifting the non-spinning apparatus over the head with one hand was extremely difficult, described as "just barely" manageable and "awkward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### The Spinning Lift

With the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] spinning at its maximum speed, the attempt to lift it over the head was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The sensation of lifting the spinning [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] was remarkably different:
> "It feels incredibly, incredibly light as I do that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
>
> "It honestly felt like it was just... wanting to go up by itself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>
>
> "It felt like I was not struggling like I was not putting in the amount of [[measurement_of_large_forces | force]] that you'd think to lift that kind of weight." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

Despite the feeling, it's important to note that the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] is not actually weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Measuring Actual Weight with a Scale

To investigate the actual weight experienced during the lift, an experiment using a scale was conducted.

*   The experimenter's body weight was approximately 72 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   When picking up the non-spinning [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]], the scale read about 91 kilograms, which accounts for the experimenter's weight plus the 19-kilogram [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

The question posed for viewers was to predict if the scale reading would be more than, less than, or equal to 91 kilograms when the spinning [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] was lifted over the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

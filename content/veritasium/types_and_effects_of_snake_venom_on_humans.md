## Types and Effects of Snake Venom on Humans

Snake venom is a complex and potent substance primarily used by snakes for catching and digesting prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Each snake species possesses a unique venom composition, specifically adapted to the animals they typically hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that approximately 120,000 people die annually from snake bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. In Australia, despite housing some of the world's most venomous snakes, only one to three people die from snake bites each year, partly due to a federally funded antivenom program that provides free antivenom to victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Lethality and Potency
The concept of the "most venomous snake" is complex because venoms are evolved to be potent against specific prey, and prey species, in turn, evolve resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. For example, honey badgers are almost completely immune to Cobra venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Scientists often test venom potency on lab mice to estimate the amount of antivenom required to neutralize a bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. A single bite from a King Cobra, for instance, contains enough venom to kill 13,000 mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Based on this, it's estimated that a King Cobra bite could kill around four human-sized rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The inland taipan, considered the most toxic land snake, can deliver enough venom in one bite to kill half a million mice or over 100 humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Human vulnerability to snake venom stems from our close evolutionary relationship with rodents, a primary prey for many snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Rodents and primates diverged on the evolutionary tree only about 75 million years ago, leading to shared biological similarities, including cell structure, blood clotting mechanisms, and nerve signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Venoms often target molecular pathways that are conserved across many vertebrates, or even the entire tree of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Ways Snake Venom Can Kill
Snake venoms typically contain a complex mixture of compounds, sometimes up to 200, which can lead to various devastating effects on the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The difficulty in treating snake bites lies in neutralizing not just one toxin, but dozens working synergistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The four main ways snake venom can be lethal include:

*   **Neurotoxic Effects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
    *   Damages the nervous system and brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   Interferes with neurotransmitters, the chemical signals between neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Hemotoxic Effects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>
    *   Thins the blood, preventing wounds from healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   Causes internal bleeding by disturbing the blood coagulation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Cytotoxic Effects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
    *   Attacks cells directly, leading to severe blisters, necrosis (tissue death), and cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Myotoxic Effects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>
    *   Destroys muscle tissue and can cause paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Most snake venoms contain a combination of neurotoxic, hemotoxic, cytotoxic, and myotoxic proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

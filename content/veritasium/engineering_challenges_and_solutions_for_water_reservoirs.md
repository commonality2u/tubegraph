Water reservoirs, especially open-air ones, present unique [[strategies_for_complex_problem_solving | engineering challenges]] that can impact water quality and public health. One notable case involves the Los Angeles Reservoir and its innovative solution to a complex problem involving water chemistry and sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>.

## The Challenge: Bromate Formation

The primary issue at the Los Angeles Reservoir stemmed from the presence of Bromide, a naturally occurring substance associated with saltwater, found in the water supply from the California Aqueduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>. While Bromide itself is harmless and difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:01">[03:21:01]</a>, it can transform into Bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

Bromate is carcinogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, and regulations around its formation were established around the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Initially, Bromate was only measured at filtration plants using ozone for disinfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, where levels remained within the 10 micrograms per liter limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

However, an unexpected discovery arose when a beverage company customer reported high levels of Bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Tests revealed that Bromate levels jumped almost immediately upon water entering the open reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. It was found that Bromide, when combined with Chlorine (used for disinfection) and exposed to bright sunlight, formed Bromate even more effectively than ozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. With Bromide in the water, necessary Chlorine for disinfection, and sunlight in an open reservoir, the only viable option was to eliminate the sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

## Exploring Solutions

Several ideas were considered to block sunlight from the reservoir:
*   **Floating Tarps:** A common solution for covering water, but this would be a multi-year project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Trampoline-like Covers:** These were dismissed as they would likely become bird perches, leading to further water quality problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **Floating HDPE Pipe:** High-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe is used in the water industry and floats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Floating a pile of pipe across the surface was considered but deemed too difficult and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   **Chipped HDPE Debris Field:** The idea of chipping pipe into a debris field across the surface was also considered, but this would create mushy, warm water with plastic, resembling a "Petri dish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

## The Solution: Shade Balls

Dr. Bryan White's research led to the discovery of "bird balls," the predecessors to what are now known as shade balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. These balls were originally used to deter waterfowl from mine tailings ponds (where they could be poisoned) and from ponds near airports (to prevent them from flying into jet engines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

A simple experiment using three inflatable kiddie pools confirmed their effectiveness: one in sunlight, one with a tarp, and one with shade balls. The shade balls immediately solved the Bromate problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

The Los Angeles Reservoir is now covered by 96 million shade balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, with the water often flowing directly to homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The sheer volume makes it look like the "world's biggest ball pit," an initially absurd sight that hides water 40-50 feet deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Shade Ball Design and Materials

*   **Color:** Shade balls are black to completely block light and prevent the Bromate reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. The black color comes from "carbon black," a material that ensures the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic lasts for at least 10 years in the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Other colors, like blue, were found to be unstable and would not last more than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Material Safety:** The balls are made of food-grade HDPE, the same material used for milk jugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. They are inert and safe for contact with drinking water, remaining stable even after years of exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
*   **Weighting:** The balls are partially filled with water to prevent them from being blown away by high winds, which are common at the LA Reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The water also makes them wobble if they roll, keeping them contained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Shape:** The spherical shape is crucial as it prevents them from stacking up or perching on the reservoir banks as water levels fluctuate. Hexagonal shapes, while proposed by other companies, proved problematic because they lock together and don't spread out as effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:01]</a>.

## Benefits Beyond Bromate Prevention

Beyond solving the Bromate issue, shade balls offer several additional [[strategies_for_complex_problem_solving | benefits]]:

*   **Algae Control:** Covering the water with shade balls significantly reduces algae growth, eliminating the need for large amounts of Chlorine previously used for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Before shade balls, the water could sometimes have a slight green tinge from algae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
*   **Bird Deterrence:** Just as their original "bird ball" purpose suggests, they effectively deter birds from landing on the water, reducing bird droppings and improving water quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Evaporation Reduction:** Contrary to the [[counterintuitive_engineering_concepts|counterintuitive]] notion that black balls would absorb heat and increase evaporation, they actually reduce it by 80-90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. This is due to:
    *   Reduced exposed surface area for water molecules to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
    *   Limited airflow over the water's surface, preventing dry air from replacing moist air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
    *   The balls mostly contain air, which acts as a good thermal insulator, preventing heat from the hot top of the balls from transferring to the water below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. The water underneath the shade balls is actually cooler than in an open reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. This is a significant benefit in a dry climate like Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

## Deployment and Operational Considerations

Operating a boat within the reservoir covered by shade balls presents its own [[challenges_of_swimming_in_multi_layer_shade_balls | challenges]]. It is "very hard" to drive a boat through them, described as being like driving through "peanut butter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The partially water-filled balls are difficult to push aside, especially when they form "close-packed crystal-like structures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Unlike open water, a boat barely drifts due to the stability provided by the interconnected balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## Cost-Effectiveness

Each shade ball costs around 33-34 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. While the initial investment for 96 million balls is substantial, the long-term savings are significant. The balls have a salvage value as they are recyclable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. Over their lifespan, the savings from reduced chlorination and evaporation are expected to offset at least half of their cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. The water quality benefit is considered "immeasurable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

The third perplexing physics problem involves a metal ring and a closed loop of chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The challenge is to make the closed ring stick to the closed loop of chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## The Expected Outcome
When holding the ring over the dangling chain and dropping it, the expected outcome is that the ring simply falls off the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This happens because it is a closed loop of chain and a closed ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## The Unexpected Outcome
Despite the common sense expectation, it is possible to make the ring stick on the chain with careful manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## The Secret to Making it Stick
The key to making the ring stick on the chain is to release it from one side before the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. By letting go with one thumb first, the ring slides off the finger, which introduces a small amount of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## The Physics Behind It
This introduced rotation causes the ring to rotate approximately 90 degrees as it slides down the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. As the ring descends, segments of the chain slide up its sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. When the ring reaches the bottom of its fall, the lowest piece of the chain appears to be "sucked into the middle of the ring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. At the last moment, this piece is pulled around, causing the ring to snap on and lock onto the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

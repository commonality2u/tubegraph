Traveling to and living on other celestial bodies like Mars presents significant [[challenges_of_microgravity_and_its_effects_on_the_human_body | challenges]] to human health, particularly concerning exercise and maintaining physical well-being in altered gravitational fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Gravitational Differences

The gravity on Mars is approximately 37% of Earth's gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This reduced gravity would allow an average jumper to achieve double the airtime compared to Earth, making it easy to dunk on a regulation basketball hoop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The Moon's gravity is even lower, at about 1/6 of Earth's, enabling extensive "crazy aerobics" without quick exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Effects on the Body

The primary concern in low-gravity environments is the weakening and shrinking of muscles, known as atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Studies indicate that muscle mass can decrease by up to 20% on space flights lasting only 5 to 11 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. On Earth, simply lifting an arm provides a minor workout because the arm accounts for about 5% of body weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This resistance is absent during a trip to Mars and only a fraction of it is present on the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Furthermore, the lack of weight pushing on bones leads to a decrease in bone density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of bone mass per month, predominantly in their lower extremities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This rate of bone loss is more than ten times faster than that experienced by people on Earth due to osteoporosis as they age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Other Difficulties

In weightless conditions, even everyday activities become challenging due to the significance of other forces, such as the surface tension of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Washing one's face, showering, brushing teeth, and using the bathroom become much harder when dealing with liquids in microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Bodies are not evolved for these different gravity situations, which can lead to nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Exercise and Mitigation Strategies

Since traditional weightlifting is ineffective in low gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, astronauts rely on elastic resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For example, astronauts on the space station are elastically tethered to a treadmill and typically exercise two and a half hours every day to combat muscle and bone loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

For future colonists on Mars, simply stepping into a spacesuit, which can weigh as much as 310 pounds, would make them feel as heavy as they are on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This added weight from the spacesuit could help maintain muscle and bone mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

While [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] is a separate concern, shielding is possible through materials like ship insulation or water, which is an excellent radiation absorber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

These difficulties are considered [[challenges_of_microgravity_and_its_effects_on_the_human_body | challenges to be overcome]] for humanity to become a multi-planetary species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

[[aerogel_properties_and_composition | Aerogel]], often called the world's lightest solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, can be engineered to exhibit dramatically different interactions with water. Its natural form is highly absorbent (hydrophilic), but it can be chemically modified to repel water (hydrophobic).

## Hydrophilic Aerogel: Absorbent by Nature

Normal silica [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] is naturally hydrophilic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:10">[05:06:10]</a>. This characteristic stems from its structure being covered with hydroxyl (OH) groups, which strongly attract water molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. When liquid is absorbed, these OH groups cause the [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] structure to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, essentially ruining the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

Despite this, [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] is very good at absorbing water due to two key [[properties_of_aerogel | properties]]:
1.  **High Surface Area** An ice-cube-sized piece of [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] contains half a football field of surface area due to its nanoscale sponge-like structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. This makes it effective at absorbing a large number of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
2.  **OH Groups** The presence of OH groups on its internal structure specifically attracts water molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | Aerogel]] can absorb up to 25 times its weight in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

### [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel | Applications]] of Hydrophilic Aerogel

Scientists have sought to exploit [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]]'s absorbent [[properties_of_aerogel | properties]] in various [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel | applications]]:

*   **Physical Insecticide** Rather than using neurotoxins, [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] can act as a physical insecticide by sticking to an insect's outer skin and drawing out moisture or oils, causing the insect to dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. This is analogous to putting salt on a slug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Museum Humidity Regulation** [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | Aerogel]] is ideal for use in museum cases, such as those made by the company Opium (which created the case for the Mona Lisa). It acts as a passive moisture regulator, absorbing moisture if humidity increases and releasing it if humidity decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
*   **Mars Quake Detection** [[uses_of_aerogel_in_space_exploration | Aerogel]] containing zeolite particles was developed for the NASA InSight mission to detect Mars quakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. These zeolite particles can absorb moisture even at very low pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, helping to maintain the exceptional vacuum required inside the small seismometers to prevent motion damping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:10]</a>. This moisture absorption acts as a passive vacuum pump, requiring no power or consumption and enabling the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## Hydrophobic Aerogel: Waterproofing Capabilities

To counteract the issue of [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] being damaged by water, it can be made hydrophobic. This is achieved by introducing a reactive chemical (a hydrophobe) that spontaneously rearranges with the internal OH groups, creating large non-polar groups that repel water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. By replacing just 30% of the OH groups lining the inside of the [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]], a perfectly water-repellent [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

This modified [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] is totally impervious to water; water bounces off it and does not penetrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. It can sit on water for months and remain dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

### [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel | Applications]] of Hydrophobic Aerogel

One demonstration of hydrophobic [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] involves coating the body with tiny particles of the material to become waterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. When submerged, a thin layer of air remains next to the skin, causing a silvery appearance due to total internal reflection where light reflects off the water-air interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. The water is repelled at the molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>, preventing the skin from feeling wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. This also provides additional buoyancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

In summary, [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]]'s [[properties_of_aerogel | properties]] can be manipulated, allowing it to be either highly absorbent (hydrophilic) or completely water-impervious (hydrophobic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

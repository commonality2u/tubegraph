The phenomenon of generating plasma by microwaving grapes, initially demonstrated nearly eight years prior to new scientific findings, lacked a thorough explanation for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. However, a detailed explanation has now been published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* by three scientists who investigated the effect using high-speed cameras, thermal cameras, and electromagnetic modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Microwave Properties and Grape Interaction

A typical household microwave operates at an electromagnetic radiation frequency of about 2.45 gigahertz, resulting in a wavelength of approximately 12 centimeters inside the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While a grape is much smaller than 12 centimeters, the crucial factor is the wavelength *inside* the grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The material of a grape has a refractive index close to 10 in the microwave regime, significantly higher than its visible light refractive index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This high refractive index causes microwaves to travel roughly ten times slower through the grape than through air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Consequently, the wavelength inside the grape is reduced to about 1.2 centimeters, which is approximately the size of a grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Microwave Trapping and Resonant Modes
When a single grape is placed in a microwave, the microwaves become trapped inside it due to the high refractive index and its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This trapping occurs when the grape's diameter is roughly equivalent to the microwave's wavelength within the material, similar to total internal reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Inside the grape, the trapped microwaves form "resonant modes" or standing waves, where the electromagnetic fields oscillate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The maximum electromagnetic field, and thus the highest heating, occurs at the center of the grape, causing it to heat from the inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Plasma Generation with Two Grapes

The scientists discovered that the effect of generating plasma does not require cutting the grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The same phenomenon can be achieved with two grapes or [[comparison_of_microwave_interaction_with_grapes_and_hydrogel_beads | hydrogel water beads]] placed close together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

When two grapes are moved close enough to touch (closer than a wavelength), the electromagnetic fields from both grapes interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This interaction causes the greatest electromagnetic field to concentrate at the contact point between the two grapes, leading to intense oscillating fields and the hottest spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. A watch glass is often used in demonstrations to keep the grapes in consistent contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Formation and Characteristics of Plasma
The extremely strong electromagnetic fields at the intersection of the two grapes are powerful enough to ionize the air, causing sparks and leading to the formation of plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. These newly created ions can then absorb more energy from the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The plasma itself pulses at 120 Hertz, which is double the 60 Hertz frequency of mains power, reflecting the pulsing amplitude of the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

By analyzing the plasma's spectrum, scientists identified strong emission lines for potassium and sodium, indicating that these ions, common in grapes, are sprayed into the air when the plasma forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Importance of Size and Water Absorption
The size of the grapes is important for [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | this effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. However, it does not need to be an exact size because water, a primary component of grapes, absorbs microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Modeling showed that if the grape material did not absorb microwaves, extreme electromagnetic field amplification would only occur at very specific sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Since grapes are made of an absorbent material like water, this broadens the peaks of amplification, allowing for a broader range of grape sizes to produce the effect, albeit with slightly less overall amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Potential Applications of the Research

Beyond being a curious phenomenon, this research has potential applications, particularly in microchip fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The current limitation in creating smaller microchips is lithography, the process of making very small features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

The observed phenomenon demonstrates that two spheres of appropriate size and refractive index can focus electromagnetic energy into a tiny spot between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. In the case of grapes, 12-centimeter microwaves are focused down to approximately a millimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If similar focusing capabilities could be achieved with light, it would significantly improve current lithography techniques, potentially enabling the creation of features with 2-nanometer resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This advancement could help continue Moore's Law, allowing for more small components on a single chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

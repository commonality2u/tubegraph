[[vine_robots_in_space_exploration|Vine robots]] are considered ideal for archeological applications due to their unique capabilities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>

## Key Features Enabling Archeological Use

*   **Ability to fit through tight spaces:** The robots can navigate curvy and twisted passageways effortlessly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   **Resistance to obstacles:** They do not typically get stuck on surfaces, even sticky ones like adhesives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> Unlike a car that gets stuck in adhesives, the [[vine_robots_in_space_exploration|vine robot]] can extend through it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   **Puncture resistance:** Even if punctured, the robot can continue to operate as long as sufficient air pressure is maintained. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   **Sensor attachment:** Sensors, such as cameras, can be attached to the front of the robot. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> One method involves an end cap that allows the camera to stay on the front, pushed from behind by the robot. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> Other [[mechanisms_of_vine_robot_operation|mechanisms of attachment]] include an external frame interlocking with an internal frame inside the pressurized body, similar to a roller coaster's wheels on a track, preventing the camera from falling off as the robot grows. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
*   **Active Steering:** [[vine_robots_in_space_exploration|Vine robots]] can be actively steered using pneumatic muscles attached to their sides. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> By inflating or deflating these muscles, the robot's sides can be shortened or lengthened, allowing for directional control. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

## Case Study: Archeological Site in Peru

A [[vine_robots_in_space_exploration|vine robot]] was deployed to an archeological site in Peru to investigate very narrow shafts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>

This ancient temple, located in the Andes mountains, was built between 1500 and 500 BC. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> Archeologists sought to understand the purpose of its underground spaces, including giant rooms called galleries and smaller ducts or tunnels branching off from them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>

The ducts were too small for a person to enter. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> The [[vine_robots_in_space_exploration|vine robot]] successfully explored three of these tunnels, providing video footage that could not have been obtained by other means. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>

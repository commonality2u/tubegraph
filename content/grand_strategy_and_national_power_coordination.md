The concept of "grand strategy" and the coordination of a nation's various instruments of power are essential for achieving national objectives and avoiding significant pitfalls in international relations. This article, based on insights from Professor Sarah Paine, explores the definition, necessity, and practice of grand strategy.

## Defining Grand Strategy

Grand strategy is defined as "the integration of all relevant instruments of national power in the pursuit of national objectives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. In modern Western governments, these instruments of national power are often represented by the different cabinet portfolios, such as finance and military affairs, whose heads advise the national leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## The Necessity of Coordination

The coordination of these diverse instruments is not merely beneficial but "absolutely necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Professor Paine argues it would be unimaginable to conduct foreign policy without bringing these different elements to the table and ensuring their efforts are aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Countries that fail to coordinate all their instruments of power risk getting into "deep, dark trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. National objectives, such as enhancing security or improving trade, necessitate a comprehensive approach that considers and coordinates all available tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Historical Examples of Failed Coordination

#### Imperial Japan in World War II
A stark example of failed coordination is Japan leading up to and during World War II. By this period, the Japanese government was heavily prioritizing its military instruments—the Army and the Navy—while neglecting coordination with civilian elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Civilian officials who might have offered countervailing advice were sometimes assassinated, and the finance minister's warnings about the unaffordability of military ventures were ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This contrasts with the period of the Meiji Restoration, where coordination was presumably better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This reflects broader discussions on [[cultural_influences_on_japanese_military_decisions]].

#### World War I
World War I serves as another significant example where grand strategy was largely absent. On all sides, civilians often allowed military generals to dictate strategy, focusing primarily on operational success without broader coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. For instance, Great Britain, geographically a maritime power, built a continental-sized army, a strategy not aligned with its inherent strengths at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. The mismanagement of World War I led to a massive power vacuum and fueled pernicious ideologies like fascism and communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. These strategic missteps are often analyzed in studies of [[historical_analysis_of_world_war_i_and_world_war_ii]].

## The Making of Grand Strategy

Despite the overarching concept of a "country's strategy," it is individuals who articulate and advocate for particular strategic directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Eisenhower's Deliberative Process
President Dwight D. Eisenhower's method of decision-making illustrates how grand strategy can be formulated through the interaction of various individuals and perspectives. He would convene all relevant parties for a given decision, solicit their recommended courses of action, and encourage arguments and counter-arguments. This process of "hashing it out" would lead to a final strategy, either a compromise or the selection of one advocated course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Government Systems and Strategic Coordination

The nature of a country's government system can significantly impact its ability to formulate and execute grand strategy. Discussions around [[dictatorship_versus_democracy_in_military_decisionmaking]] highlight these distinctions.

### Democracies vs. Dictatorships
Democracies, with their inherent debates and necessity to consider counter-arguments (lest the ruling party lose an election), possess a strength in strategic formulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Conversely, dictatorships that streamline decision-making and suppress disagreement risk doubling down on bad decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Post-WWI Institution Building
The superior coordination of the U.S. and Britain in World War II can be partly attributed to their democratic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Furthermore, many strategic leaders of WWII in the West were conscripts of WWI. Having experienced the horrors and failures of the first war, they thought deeply about its shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Their solution involved massive-scale institution building and the integration of all elements of national power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This led to the creation of organizations like the National Security Council (via the National Security Act), the United Nations, and NATO, all aimed at better strategic coordination than what was seen in WWI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Broader Consequences of Uncoordinated Policy

### The Hawley-Smoot Tariff: "Half-Court Tennis"
The enactment of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff by the U.S. in 1930 provides an example of a policy made without adequate consideration for grand strategic implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. This decision, aimed at protecting domestic jobs, failed to anticipate the retaliatory measures from other nations—a behavior described as "half-court tennis," where one only focuses on their side of the court without considering the opponent's reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>.

This tariff undermined Japanese leaders who advocated for cooperation with the international order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>. As a trade-dependent nation, Japan then saw empire-building as a means to secure necessary resources, leading to the invasion of Manchuria in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. This illustrates a failure to think deeply and broadly about policy interactions, a key component of grand strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>. Such failures to think broadly can have devastating global consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>. These dynamics also correspond to [[role_of_the_us_oil_embargo_and_diplomatic_miscommunications_prewwii]] and the broader [[impact_of_oil_on_historical_and_modern_geopolitics]].

## Conclusion

The effective formulation and execution of grand strategy, through the deliberate coordination of all instruments of national power, is vital for a nation's success and security. Historical examples underscore the profound negative consequences that arise from a lack of such coordination, emphasizing the enduring importance of this comprehensive approach to statecraft.

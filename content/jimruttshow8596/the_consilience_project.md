The Consilience Project is a new information service launched by Daniel Schmachtenberger and his associates, described as a blend of journalism and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Jim Rutt, the host, has been an advisor to the project since its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Core Purpose

The project aims to support a "new cultural renaissance or new cultural enlightenment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. It connects three key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>:
1.  **Unique Global Problems**: Addressing the challenges faced by the world in an era of exponential technology, digital globalization, and issues never encountered before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
2.  **New Problem-Solving Capacities**: Identifying the necessary problem-solving capacities, new social institutions, and governance models required to tackle complex, large-scale, and rapidly evolving issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
3.  **Cultural Prerequisites**: Cultivating the cultural conditions among people for these new institutions and capacities to emerge organically, rather than being imposed from the top-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

Ultimately, The Consilience Project seeks to define the current problem space well enough to derive design criteria for new systems, enabling people to participate in developing these new systems and capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Differentiating from Traditional Media and Education

The project recognizes the historical roles of education (developing societal capacities) and the press (informing the public) in a civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. In an open society like a democracy or republic, these roles are uniquely vital, demanding higher levels of knowledge and civic participation from the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

The Consilience Project does not aim to replace the fourth estate or public education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Instead, it offers theoretical pieces to help people understand these institutions more fundamentally: their historical roles, how they've eroded in the West, and what adequate versions would look like for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

## The Problem Landscape

The world faces unprecedented challenges in terms of scale, complexity, and acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Scale**: The power asymmetry between large entities (e.g., Amazon) and individuals is vastly greater today than in the past (e.g., a 100-person shipyard in 1776) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.
*   **Complexity**: [[Complexity science and societal systems | Quantitative differences]] can become qualitative changes, as seen with nuclear weapons making global self-destruction possible, unlike any previous warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
*   **Speed**: The rate of change (`derivative`) and acceleration (`second derivative`) in many domains are significantly higher than in any previous era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

Past societal systems, like feudalism, socialism, communism, or capitalism, and their underlying theories (e.g., Scottish Enlightenment market theory), are inadequate for current issues involving AI, drones, and global social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Solutions of the past often created the new problems we face today (e.g., GDP growth leading to environmental issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. The project emphasizes that current problem-solving processes either fail to solve catastrophic risks or cause worse cumulative problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:08:00]</a>.

The current understanding of problems is often too narrow, focusing on individual issues (e.g., climate change, systemic racism) rather than the underlying generative dynamics and their interconnectedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>.

## Content Categories

The Consilience Project's publishing branch releases three types of articles, with plans to convert them into other media forms like podcasts and animations for wider accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>.

### 1. Foundations Series
These are theoretical pieces discussing the unique problem landscape and social theory, evaluating past theories and identifying their inadequacies for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>.
*   **"Democracy in the Epistemic Commons"**: This article explores the concept of the [[Epistemic Commons and Knowledge Sharing | epistemic commons]] â€“ the shared process of developing belief about what is true and shared understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>. It highlights that an open society relies on citizens' ability to make sense of complex issues, which is compromised by the erosion of education and the fourth estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>.
*   **"Challenges to 21st Century Sense Making"**: This piece illustrates why the [[Epistemic Commons and Knowledge Sharing | epistemic commons]] is much trickier today than in 1776, due to the complexity of issues, fragmented media, and the pathological nature of an ad-driven media landscape that incentivizes bias and tribalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:47:00">[32:47:00]</a>.

### 2. Situational Assessments
These apply the project's social theory to current global issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>. They factor in various narrative views (left/right, different countries) and epistemologies to achieve higher-order insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:56:00">[24:56:00]</a>.
*   **China's activity in East Africa**: This article frames how the West has engaged with the developing world versus China's approach, highlighting geopolitical differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49:00">[33:49:00]</a>.
*   **French vs. US Secularism**: This piece explains the fundamental differences in historical approaches to freedom of religion, revealing how cultural biases can lead to misunderstandings and poor global policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:00">[34:30:00]</a>.

### 3. Meta News
These articles analyze highly polarized topics, addressing the reasons for polarization and the vested interests pushing specific narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>. The goal is to help people develop a "memetic immune system" to narrative warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a>.
*   **"Were bricks planted at the George Floyd protests?"**: This analysis examines the highly contested topic of whether bricks were planted to escalate violence during the George Floyd protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>. It forensically breaks down how narratives formed and propagated, showing that people often clung to beliefs reinforcing their existing emotionally intensified perspectives, even when evidence was inconclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>. The article emphasizes the importance of comfort with uncertainty over "wrong certainty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:41:00">[37:41:00]</a>.

## Underlying Philosophy

The project aims to counter the "runaway confirmation bias" prevalent in modern discourse, where even slight reinforcement of an existing worldview leads to it being accepted as truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:03:00">[38:03:00]</a>. It critiques the "ad-driven model" of major platforms like Facebook and YouTube, which optimize for engagement by exploiting limbic hijacking (fear, desire, tribalism), leading to increased [[Collective intelligence and overcoming tribalism and misinformation | polarization]] and extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:07:00">[45:07:00]</a>.

The project promotes:
*   **Transcending [[Collective intelligence and overcoming tribalism and misinformation | Tribalism]]**: Encouraging people to move beyond tribal loyalty to engage in "real epistemics and real good faith dialogue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>.
*   **Cognitive and Emotional Sovereignty**: Helping individuals develop a memetic immune system against being easily hijacked by narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Epistemologies**: An adequate "cultural enlightenment" must include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>:
    *   **Third-person epistemology (Science)**: Objective measurement and repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. While powerful, science doesn't provide "ought" (ethical) guidance and can lead to rivalrous dynamics when combined with exponential technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>. [[Complexity science and emergentism | Emergentism]] of rivalrous dynamics multiplied by exponential tech is seen as a generator of existential risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.
    *   **Second-person epistemology (Dialogue/Empathy)**: The ability to truly understand and inhabit another person's perspective and feelings, like the Socratic or Hegelian dialectic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.
    *   **First-person epistemology (Self-awareness)**: Understanding one's own cognitive biases, desire for certainty, and unwillingness to admit error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>. This relates to the stoic tradition and Eastern practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.

This approach aligns with the idea of an "Enlightenment 2.0," absorbing critiques from postmodernism but moving towards a constructive new synthesis of understanding and shared values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>. It pushes for a new basis for choice-making beyond pure game theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>. The goal is to coordinate choices to enable cooperation among diverse populations, a significant challenge for open societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

## Target Audience and Outreach

The initial target audience comprises generally educated adults who are willing to engage deeply with complex, nuanced, and non-bias-confirming content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>. This includes those already concerned about catastrophic risks and seeking better ways to think about solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>.

The project plans to expand its reach through:
*   **Transmedia Translation**: Converting articles into animations (e.g., 15-minute high school student accessible versions) and podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.
*   **Partnering for Decentralized Catalysis**: Working with other groups and individuals (e.g., rap battle platform builders, TikTok influencers) who can translate and bring content to diverse communities in ways the project itself cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>.

The project aims to "catalyze a kind of decentralized cultural renaissance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>, recognizing existing nascent movements (like Game B, metamodern, integral, and humane technology initiatives) and helping them recognize their shared purpose of upgrading culture to address global problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

## Operational Model and Community Building

The Consilience Project operates as a non-profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, committed to ethical media practices:
*   **No Paywalls, Ads, or Data Sales**: Information is freely accessible, avoiding perverse incentives of traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>.
*   **Donation-Funded**: Relies on donations, with strict rules against accepting funds with strings attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.
*   **No Individual Bylines**: Articles are published without individual author titles to emphasize collective intelligence, focus on content, and protect authors from ad hominem attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>. This is part of prototyping how to do [[Collective intelligence and overcoming tribalism and misinformation | collective intelligence]] well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Termination**: The project is designed to shut down after five years, with a public post-mortem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. This avoids the common organizational incentive to perpetuate existence rather than truly solve problems, ensuring it acts as a catalyst rather than a permanent power structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>.

For community building, the project is working on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>:
*   **Curating Resources**: Identifying and curating groups doing critical work related to the [[Epistemic Commons and Knowledge Sharing | epistemic commons]], sense-making, meaning-making, and choice-making capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:17">[01:24:17]</a>.
*   **Creating Forums**: Developing digital architectures for deep discussions that incentivize quality sense-making and good-faith discourse, rather than degenerate "troll wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>.
*   **Sharing Methods**: Publishing its own methodologies (e.g., for meta news) to inspire and empower other media organizations and individuals to do better work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

The project hopes to show people what is possible in media, changing the nature of demand from "salacious headlines" to a desire for long, nuanced, and bias-challenging content, thus fostering a "race to the top" in information quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>.

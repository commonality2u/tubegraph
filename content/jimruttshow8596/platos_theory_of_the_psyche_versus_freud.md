Plato, in some sense, can be called the father of [[cognitive_science_and_the_flat_mind_theory | psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> and [[cognitive_science_and_the_flat_mind_theory | cognitive science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. He applied a nascent scientific approach to the psyche itself, providing the first bona fide theory about its nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Plato's Model of the Psyche

Plato proposed that the psyche is divided into semi-autonomous components, each identifiable by its primary motivation and cognitive scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This [[triad_structures_in_philosophy | triad structure]] consists of:

1.  **The Monster**: Represented mythologically, it resides in the genitalia and stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. It motivates primarily with pleasure and pain and is directed towards very short-term, superficial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
2.  **The Lion (Thymus)**: Located in the chest, the thymus encompasses social emotions like pride, esteem, shame, and guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. As lions are social animals, it motivates by honor and shame, pursuing longer-term, concrete social-cultural goals with a middling cognitive scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
3.  **The Man**: Situated in the head, this part is motivated by truth and falsity and is capable of reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The "man" pursues long-term, abstract goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

In everyday life, especially if one is not well-conditioned and wise, the "monster" often wields more power than the "man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Connection to Freud and Modern Psychology

Plato's model of the psyche maps on in many ways to Sigmund Freud's theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Modern [[cognitive_science_and_the_flat_mind_theory | psychology]] continues to discover this idea of different centers of motivation and cognitive grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This ancient insight also aligns with:

*   The proposal of a reptilian brain, mammalian brain, and neo-mammalian brain (McLean's triune brain model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   Stanovich's System 1 and System 2 thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Current [[cognitive_science_and_the_flat_mind_theory | theories of hyperbolic discounting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

Indeed, much of [[cognitive_science_and_the_flat_mind_theory | psychology]] can be seen as a footnote to Plato in important ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Hyperbolic Discounting

[[cognitive_science_and_the_flat_mind_theory | Hyperbolic discounting]] is a phenomenon observed across species, indicating its deep adaptive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. It describes the tendency for present stimuli to be significantly more salient than future stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This is adaptive because one should calibrate attention based on the probability of an event occurring; a present event has 100% probability, while future events drop dramatically in probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

A common example is procrastination: opting for immediate pleasure (e.g., partying) over starting a long-term goal (e.g., an essay due in three weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

However, this adaptive trait can also be maladaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. [[cognitive_science_and_the_flat_mind_theory | Hyperbolic discounting]] can blind individuals to abstract features of the future. While individual future events may have low probability, their common goal or outcome can have a high probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. For much of human history, living "hand to mouth" meant that short-term survival (e.g., not starving in the next two weeks) was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Long-term goals like college applications or career planning were not what humans were "engineered for" by evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## Rationality and Self-Deception

Plato's idea is that if the "monster" (impulsive desires) or "lion" (glory-seeking) is too much in charge, the proper ratio and inner relationship between the three parts of the psyche is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. This inner conflict becomes an ongoing source of self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

Plato suggests that by properly aligning these parts, one can achieve inner peace and reduce self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. This alignment allows an individual to see more deeply into reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>, leading to a process of transformation.

### Anagogic Transformation (`anagogi`)

This transformational process, referred to as `anagogi` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>, is a mutually reinforcing loop:

*   **Realigning the Self**: Reducing self-deception leads to a deeper capacity to perceive reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   **New Relationships with Reality**: Seeing more deeply into reality transforms the individual, further realigning the inner culture of the psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Ascent**: This continuous cycle of inner optimization and improved capacity to realize real patterns allows one to see more and more deeply into the world and the psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.

This `anagogi` process is central to Plato's model of happiness and the pursuit of wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. It transforms the world from one of limited perception (like shadows in a cave) to one of profound realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

The [[Russia Ukraine conflict analysis | Russia-Ukraine conflict]] has prompted an unprecedented "network response" from the West, involving both governmental and non-governmental entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This response includes more severe sanctions than previously inflicted on any nation, with many companies pulling back from Russia at non-trivial economic costs, even when not legally obligated to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Nature of the Western Response

Samo Burja describes this phenomenon as a new expression of "soft power," now best understood as "network power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Social media, particularly Twitter, has intensely sped up this process by shortening the communication latency between Western organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This platform has fostered a highly unified media space among the white-collar, educated class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, leading to a much sharper and faster condemnation and response than would have been otherwise possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. An example of this accelerated consensus was the decision to remove Russian banks from SWIFT, which occurred in just two days, despite expectations of weeks of negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Economic Harm to Russia

Serious economic harm has already occurred to the Russian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The nominal purpose of these sanctions is to compel Russia to desist from its military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. However, a deeper, actual reason might be to weaken Russia to make it less of a future threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. It is anticipated that the desire to limit Russian military potential will be achieved to a significant degree, meaning Russia will likely be a weaker power in 2030 due to these economic costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

However, the effectiveness of the sanctions is mixed:
*   Approximately half of the imposed sanctions are considered to "have teeth," meaning they entail significant economic costs for both Russia and the sanctioning companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Examples include Boeing and Airbus cutting off parts and maintenance for jet engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   The other half of sanctions are more symbolic in nature, with some companies issuing strong rhetoric but not undertaking actions that severely impact their revenue streams (e.g., stopping new clients but continuing to service existing ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

Despite the economic impact, it is doubted that these sanctions will directly stop the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_military_strategy | war]] in the short term, as Putin is seen as overcommitted to its pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

## Future Implications

The current conflict and the Western response have broader [[geopolitical_implications_of_the_russiaukraine_conflict | geopolitical implications]]:

*   **Return of Large Wars**: The [[RussiaUkraine war analysis | war in Ukraine]] signifies that "big wars still happen," a notion largely dismissed in recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. This suggests a very different international landscape where middle powers like Russia might pursue large-scale conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Collective Deterrence**: It is speculated that this network economic response could become an effective deterrent against aggressive warfare in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. If the aftermath costs are severe enough, it might act as a deterrent even if it doesn't immediately stop the current conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.
*   **China's Perspective**: China will likely perceive a strong benefit in disentangling from Western economies to gain political freedom of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>. This could lead to a multi-decade policy of building new partnerships with African and Asian countries, and with Russia, to provide China with the resources and markets it needs, bypassing global institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Such a strategy would allow China the political ability to address questions like the future of Taiwan without Western interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. This could mean China might delay any action on Taiwan for 20 years while developing a disconnected global trade network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.

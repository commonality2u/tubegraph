Western sanctions against Russia in response to the [[RussiaUkraine conflict overview | conflict in Ukraine]] represent a new and intensified form of soft power, leveraging network effects to achieve rapid and widespread economic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

## Nature of the Western Response

The West's reaction to the [[RussiaUkraine conflict overview | conflict]] involved both governmental sanctions and a significant number of private companies voluntarily withdrawing from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This phenomenon has been described as a "new expression of soft power," which is now better understood as [[Geopolitical implications of Western sanctions and network effects | network power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. The intermediation of communication, particularly through social media platforms like Twitter, intensely sped up the process, leading to a much sharper and faster Western response than might have otherwise occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

This rapid consensus was partly driven by a "vastly more unified media space" among the white-collar, educated class across Western nations (e.g., France, Germany, Britain, United States) who actively participate on shared platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This acceleration meant that measures like kicking Russian banks out of SWIFT, initially expected to take weeks of negotiation, happened in just two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

### Dual Purpose of Sanctions
While the nominal purpose of these sanctions is to compel Russia and President Putin to desist from the [[RussiaUkraine conflict overview | military operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, an underlying objective may be to weaken Russia as a future threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

## Economic Harm to Russia

"Serious harm to the Russian economy has already happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. It is expected that there will be an economic cost to Russia that means it will be a weaker power in 2030 than it would have been without these sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

However, not all sanctions are equally impactful:
*   Approximately half of the sanctions imposed have "teeth," meaning they come at significant economic costs not only to Russia but also to the companies imposing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Examples include Boeing and Airbus cutting off parts and maintenance for jet engines, which is a substantial economic measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
*   The other half are largely symbolic, with companies making statements about not taking new clients from Russia but continuing to service existing ones, which account for most of their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

## Limitations and Future Implications

Despite the severity, sanctions are unlikely to immediately halt the [[RussiaUkraine conflict overview | war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>, as Putin is seen as overcommitted to the conflict for domestic political reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

This new form of collective deterrence, if sufficiently strong, might act as an effective deterrent against aggressive warfare in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. However, it's also possible that if Russia makes territorial gains, other countries might see this as a challenge to learn how to fight these wars better, minimizing costs and designing their economies to be more robust against such [[Geopolitical implications of Western sanctions and network effects | economic network attacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

China, in particular, may perceive a strong benefit in disentangling from Western economies to gain "political freedom of action" in addressing issues like the Taiwan question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. This could lead to a multi-decade policy of building new partnerships directly with African and Asian countries, as well as Russia, to secure resources and markets independent of Western global institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. This strategic shift could allow China the political ability to pursue its goals, even if it seems paradoxical to build a vast global network for a comparatively small objective like Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.

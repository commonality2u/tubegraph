SingularityNET is a [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | distributed network]] that enables individuals and organizations to create, share, and monetize [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] services at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. It is led by Ben Goertzel, who also leads the OpenCog [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AGI]] software framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

## Core Principles and Origins

The concept of SingularityNET evolved from ideas that Ben Goertzel had been prototyping since the late 1990s with his "Webmind" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. Webmind was conceived as a distributed network of autonomous agents cooperating to manifest emergent intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. While OpenCog focused on a more structured and orderly approach to AI, SingularityNET aims to create a loosely coupled network of diverse [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

## An Economy of Minds

SingularityNET envisions a "society of minds" or an "economy of mind" where [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]]s can interact and transact with each other, or with external agents, by paying for services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>. This economic aspect is used for assigning credit and assessing value within the network, which is considered an important aspect of [[evolution_of_ai_and_societal_impacts | cognition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. This approach is intended to foster emergent cognitive dynamics and collective behaviors within the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

### Decentralized Infrastructure
To enable this system, SingularityNET uses blockchain technology as its underlying "plumbing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. This allows [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] agents to interact without a central controller, instead relying on heterogeneous control and participatory democratic interaction among the [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] agents themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.

## Vision and Impact

SingularityNET's vision is multi-faceted:
*   **Enabling Good** It aims to enable [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] to do more good in the world than is possible with centralized, hegemonic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>. The current centralized [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] landscape is characterized by activities like "selling, spying, killing, and gambling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. In contrast, SingularityNET promotes applications in areas such as education, disease diagnosis, scientific research, elder care, and art creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.
*   **Fostering Emergent [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AGI]]** The network's decentralized nature is seen as a way for current narrow [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]]s to evolve into future [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AGI]]s, guiding these emerging intelligences towards compassionate and aesthetically creative goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.
*   **Countering Centralization** It seeks to be a counter-trend to the concentration of [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] progress in the hands of a few large corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>. While recognizing that current centralized approaches are driven by socio-economic dynamics rather than malice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>, the network effects inherent in their models (like advertising and surveillance) lead to a dominant few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. SingularityNET leverages similar two-sided platform network effects, connecting [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] supply (developers) with demand (product developers and end-users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. The goal is not necessarily to displace large tech companies, but to establish a major role for [[decentralized_governance_and_its_impact_on_ai_development | decentralized AI]] in the world, similar to how Linux coexists with Microsoft and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

To achieve critical mass and activate its two-sided market, SingularityNET prioritizes building the demand side while also cultivating supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.
*   **Singularity Studio:** A for-profit company is being spun off to build commercial products, initially targeting FinTech, on top of the SingularityNET platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. Revenue from these products (e.g., risk management for financial firms) will drive the utility of the AGI token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.
*   **SingularityNET X-lab Accelerator:** This initiative recruits community projects to build software products for various niches, utilizing [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] on the SingularityNET platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. These projects receive tokens, AI services, publicity, and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.

By fostering serious utilization of the AGI token and its ecosystem, SingularityNET aims to attract more developers to the platform by offering a viable market for their [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. This financial incentive, combined with the project's "cool value" and political appeal for [[decentralized_governance_and_its_impact_on_ai_development | decentralized]] [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]], is expected to attract supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.

## Future Outlook

SingularityNET represents a visionary project that seeks to change the landscape of [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] development by promoting [[decentralized_governance_and_its_impact_on_ai_development | decentralization]] and open participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. Its success hinges on achieving critical mass and demonstrating the value of its tokenized [[economic_transactions_in_ai_applications_and_micropayments | micro-payments]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>.

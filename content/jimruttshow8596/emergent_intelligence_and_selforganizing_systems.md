[[Complexity theory and systems thinking | Complex self-organizing systems]] and [[Emergentism and complexity science | emergence]] are considered foundational for understanding and achieving [[Emergent complexity and consciousness | Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI) that parallels human cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. This perspective contrasts with mainstream AI approaches that often focus on hierarchical pattern recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

## Core Concepts

### Emergent Intelligence
The idea of [[emergence and complexity science | emergent intelligence]] suggests that higher-level intelligent behaviors can arise from the interactions of simpler components within a system, rather than being explicitly programmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. This concept was central to early AGI research, including the Webmind project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>.

### Self-Organizing Systems
A [[Selforganizing communities | self-organizing complex system]] is one where internal interactions lead to macroscopic order or structure without external guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. This is seen as a key aspect of how the mind works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>. The human brain itself is described as a massively parallel system where each part independently contributes to its overall function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:40">[01:51:40]</a>.

### Nonlinear Dynamics and Strange Attractors
[[Complexity science and emergentism | Nonlinear dynamics]] and [[Emergence of Life and Complex Systems | strange attractors]] are crucial for understanding how the brain synchronizes and coordinates its many parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. These concepts are linked to phenomena like creativity, the self, free will, and the conscious focus of attention, which involve the [[Emergence of Life and Complex Systems | emergence]] of [[Complexity and emergence in biological systems | autopoietic systems]] of activity patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

## Two Fundamental Forces: Evolution and Autopoiesis

Intelligence systems are underpinned by two main forces, described as "being" and "becoming" in philosophical terms, or "evolution" and "autopoiesis" in dynamic terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

### Evolution
Evolution involves the creation of new things from old components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>. In the context of the brain, this is seen in concepts like neural Darwinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

### Autopoiesis
Autopoiesis, a term coined by Maturana and Varela, refers to a system's ability for "self-creation" or "self-building" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. This is a specific kind of complex nonlinear dynamic observed in biology, where a system continuously rebuilds and reconstructs itself to remain intact within a changing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>. Examples include the immune system's network theory and the brain's cell assembly theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.

## Application in AGI Systems

### OpenCog's Cognitive Synergy
OpenCog's architecture is designed to foster [[Emergent complexity and consciousness | cognitive synergy]], where multiple AI algorithms cooperate on the same dynamic knowledge graph, the "AtomSpace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. This cooperation means if one algorithm gets stuck or makes slow progress, others can understand its intermediate state and intervene to help, making new progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. This process is intended to be bi-directional and concurrent, with algorithms helping each other in complex networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>.

Examples of cognitive synergy within OpenCog:
*   A probabilistic logic engine (PLN) can be unstuck by an evolutionary program learning algorithm (Moses) introducing creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, or by perception introducing sensory-level metaphors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>.
*   A deep neural network stuck on video recognition can refer reasoning to perform analogy inference or evolutionary learning to brainstorm creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>.

This approach emphasizes the interplay between different AI algorithms, unlike modular systems with clean API interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>. The focus on graphs and probabilities also distinguishes it from older "blackboard systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.

### SingularityNET's Distributed Network
SingularityNET extends the concept of [[Selforganizing communities | self-organizing systems]] to a distributed network of autonomous AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>. These agents, each with their own AI methods, interact via APIs and can optionally share state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>. This "society of minds" operates with a payment system where AIs pay each other for work, or are paid by external agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:21">[01:50:21]</a>. This economic aspect aids in assigning credit and assessing value within the network, further contributing to [[Emergent complexity and consciousness | emergent AI]] behaviors in a more loosely coupled network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:30">[01:50:30]</a>.

The blockchain infrastructure allows these AI agents to interact without a central controller, instead relying on heterogeneous, participatory control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:53">[01:51:53]</a>. This decentralized, open approach is deemed crucial for allowing AI to contribute positively to the world, beyond the "selling, spying, killing, and gambling" applications often driven by centralized corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications

Ignoring [[Emergent complexity and consciousness | emergence]] and [[Emergentism and complexity science | nonlinear dynamics]] in AI development, as seen in current deep learning systems, means missing crucial aspects that make the human mind interesting, such as creativity and the self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. This focus on maximizing simply formulated reward functions is often tied to business models and key performance indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to develop "open-ended intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a> â€“ [[Emergence of Life and Complex Systems | self-organizing complex adaptive dynamical systems]] that may stretch the current understanding of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>. Such systems might not have human-like consciousness or maximize simple reward functions, but would be incredibly complex and adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>.

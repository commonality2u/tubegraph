Forrest Landry's [[immanent_metaphysics | Immanent Metaphysics]] delves into the fundamental nature of reality and the relationship between self and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This framework, which began discussion in November 2020 on episode 96, continues to be explored, providing a review of its core concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Landry's work is accessible on his website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Fundamental Inquiry: Self and Reality
[[immanent_metaphysics | Metaphysics]] starts as an inquiry into the nature of the relationship between self and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This relationship is considered the essence of its study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The "self" in this context refers to a historical notion, particularly the "plane of perception," which acts as a rhetorical device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. On one side is everything perceived, and on the other, the self doing the perception, encompassing subjective experience and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The relationship between the subjective and the objective is considered ontologically real and worthy of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This relationship can be viewed as that between the measure and the measured, similar to the scientific method where measurement is a fundamental concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The ontological process of making a measurement or observation is the grounding basis for identifying something's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Existence, reality, or objectivity are asserted if there can be an interaction, measurement, observable aspect, and repeatability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The notion of interaction is prior to concepts like "exists," "real," or "objective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Perceiver, Perceived, and Perceiving
These three concepts overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>:
*   **Perceiver:** The observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Perceiving:** The process of perception itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Perceived:** The content of the perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

Perception can be modeled as a communication channel where a "signal producing world" sends a signal through a channel to a "self" on the receiving end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Choice, Causality, and Process
The concept of [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] is central to Landry's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | Choice]] in the subjective realm is compared to causality in the objective realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The notion of self is characterized in terms of [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

*   **Determinism vs. Causality:** Mathematical knowledge can have a deterministic character, fully specified infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Scientific knowledge, however, is of a causal nature and doesn't require infinite specification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Indeterminism/Randomness vs. Choice:** Perfect randomness is often considered meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | Choice]], conversely, is meaningful to the person making it, even if not evidentially meaningful to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Irreducible Randomness:** In complex systems like the brain, predictability is limited due to sensitivity to initial conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. After factoring out all predictable elements (like information compression), there's a residual unpredictable randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. From an objective viewpoint, choices might appear to come from randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. However, from the subjective, first-person perspective, choices have a meaningful context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Duality:** The notion of [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] and causation are considered "duals" of one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>. Causation is a mesoscopic/macroscopic pattern, while [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] is an absence of patterns from an objective view, but subjectively meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.

The universe contains "stuff about creation, stuff about existence, and stuff about interaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>. Interaction is considered more fundamental than existence, and even more fundamental than creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.

## Realism and Idealism
The relationship between realism and idealism is described as more primal than both realism or idealism themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   **Realist Perspective:** Presupposes the existence of "stuff" and then considers interactions between it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. This perspective is based on causation and is typical for developing science and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. It suggests "first there is matter, and then maybe there is mind" as an epiphenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.
*   **Idealist Perspective:** Assumes the subjective observer as primary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. The existence of anything is contingent on an observer's capacity to apprehend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. It suggests "first there is mind, and then we can maybe know that there is matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

The notion of interaction as a process is more primary than both the perceiver and the perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. Epistemology (how we know) is the basis of ontology (what exists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. The relationship between epistemology and ontology, which is a dynamic, is how we come to have the concept of real things or a self-observing entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

## The Concept of Process
The term "process" in this context includes more than its normal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. While ordinarily referring to changes of state over time (like in computer science where processes are often assumed deterministic), Landry's use includes probabilities and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. It builds in a kind of indeterminism not always obvious in typical usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.

## Core Philosophical Development
The [[immanent_metaphysics | metaphysics]] is based on two key ideas: foundational triplication and type isomorphism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.

### Foundational Triplication
This idea models all that is real as having a foundation in at least three essential concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. These concepts are inseparable, yet mutually distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. When examining any field of study, there are always at least three primal concepts necessary for its basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

Examples:
*   **Universe:** Creation, Existence, and Interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.
*   **Language:** Statements, Semantics, and Syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. If any of these is completely absent, the other two are also absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Music:** Intensity, Pattern/Structure (Melody and Harmony), and Tonality (Instrument sound/pitch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. These can be varied independently, but if one is absent, the others are too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>.
*   **Real (as a domain):** [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | Choice]], Change, and Causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.
*   **Perception:** Perceiver, Perceived, and Perceiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.
*   **Space-time:** Space, Time, and Possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

### Type Isomorphism
This idea considers that the essential concepts of each domain have similar patterns of correspondence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. When examining the relationships between primal concepts in different domains, a consistent underlying "template pattern" emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. This allows for identifying "types" of individual concepts across different domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.

## The Modalities
The "types" of primal concepts are referred to as modalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. The three modalities are:

*   **Imminent:** Has a very direct, immediate, first-person [[process]] notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. Often represents a relationship between two other concepts, or a zero/one context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. Corresponds to a first-person relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>.
*   **Omniscient:** Represents something one framework removed, like observing a static pattern from a remote position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>. This implies knowing all aspects, even if not being that thing oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. Corresponds to a third-person relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.
*   **Transcedent:** Even more removed, another framework away, representing a relationship between domains of context altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. It's a semantic notion not directly measurable, like abstract mathematical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. Corresponds to a second-person relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

Exact, closed definitions cannot be given for the modalities, as their meaning is implicit in the axioms and their theorems, often expressed metaphorically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

### Examples of Modality Mappings:
| Domain | Imminent | Omniscient | Transcendent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Universe | Interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a> | Existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a> | Creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a> |
| Language | Statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a> | Syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a> | Semantics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a> |
| Real | Change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a> | Causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a> | Choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a> |
| Perception | Perceiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a> | Perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a> | Perceiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a> |
| Space-time | Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a> | Space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a> | Possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a> |

## The Axioms
The axioms describe the patterns of relationships between the foundational concepts of a domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.

### Axiom 1: Imminent is more fundamental than the Omniscient and/or the Transcendent
This axiom states that the imminent modality is more fundamental than the omniscient and/or transcendent modalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. Additionally, the omniscient and transcendent are "conjugate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

*   **Conjugation:** This refers to a hyperbolic relationship, where dynamics in one domain induce phenomena in the other, like electric and magnetic fields, or time and frequency domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. In language, if much effort is spent on semantics, syntax might be harder to construct, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. There's a trade-off in the degree of clarity between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. This relational concept is the imminent modality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.
*   **Imminent Fundamentalness:** For the example of language, statements (imminent) are more fundamental than syntax (omniscient) and semantics (transcendent) because one cannot talk about semantics or syntax without making use of statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. The definition of a term is itself a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

Axiom 1 represents a "third person perspective" on theory, focusing on the structure of concepts and their relationships in a domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:27">[01:42:27]</a>.

### Axiom 2: A class of the transcendent precedes an instance of the imminent; a class of the imminent precedes an instance of the omniscient; and a class of the omniscient precedes an instance of the transcendent
Understanding Axiom 2 is considered one of the most difficult aspects of this [[immanent_metaphysics | metaphysics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. It requires shifting from the domain of theory (third-person perspective) to the domain of practice (first-person perspective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.

*   **Choice as a Process:** To have a [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]], three things are needed: a range of things to choose from (potentials), an actual selection event, and a consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>. The choice must be distinguishable from a non-choice, implying an irreversible consequence that manifests in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>.
*   **Flow from Potentiality to Actuality:** [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | Choice]] is analogous to creation itself, an emergence from potential to actual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.
    *   **Class of Transcendent to Instance of Imminent:** The range of potentials (e.g., choices for an evening) is a "class of the transcendent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:43">[01:28:43]</a>. The actual selection event (e.g., deciding to read a book) is an "instance of the imminent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:43">[01:28:43]</a>.
    *   **Class of Imminent to Instance of Omniscient:** The "consequence" of a choice is not a single event but a multiplicity of smaller, component choices (e.g., picking the book, chair, turning pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>. This "class of the imminent" (multiplicity of selections) results in a "singularity of consequence" (an instance of the omniscient, like the memory of reading a book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>. Causality is always a plurality of antecedents to a plurality of consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>.
    *   **Class of Omniscient to Instance of Transcendent:** The potentiality for choice (e.g., having the option to read a book) is contingent upon a multiplicity of prior consequences or outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:46">[01:31:46]</a>. Each possibility is contingent on prior outcomes, moving from a "class of the omniscient" to a single instance of the transcendent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>.

Axiom 2 describes a circular flow of plural to singular: potentiality (class of transcendent) -> selection (instance of imminent) -> consequence (instance of omniscient) -> new potentiality (instance of transcendent, but a *class* for the next cycle). It depicts an ongoing [[process]] of making choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:55">[01:32:55]</a>. It's a first-person experience, accounting for randomness and the fact that theory doesn't perfectly predict practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>.

### Axiom 3: The classes and instances of the Imminent, Omniscient, and Transcendent are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable
This axiom is closely aligned with the idea of foundational triplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:59">[01:37:59]</a>. It states that one cannot truly understand any one of the fundamental concepts of a domain without implying or incorporating some understanding or assumption of the other two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:30">[01:37:30]</a>. For example, understanding the concept of "universe" requires understanding creation, existence, and interaction, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:46">[01:37:46]</a>.

Axiom 3 corresponds to a "second person perspective," mediating between Axiom 1 (theory) and Axiom 2 (practice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:37">[01:45:37]</a>. It's about the "soundness relationship" — the peerage between different domains' foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:09">[01:46:09]</a>.

## Relationship Between Axioms and Modalities
There is a mapping between the modalities and the axioms themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:24">[01:38:24]</a>:
*   **Axiom 1** has the nature of the **Omniscient modality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:56">[01:40:56]</a>. It's like viewing a photograph, a framework removed from the immediate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>. It describes the structure of concepts and their theoretical relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.
*   **Axiom 2** has the nature of the **Imminent modality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:59">[01:40:59]</a>. As [[process]], it's a first-person perspective, directly involving the subjective experience of making choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:20">[01:43:20]</a>.
*   **Axiom 3** has the nature of the **Transcendent modality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>. It represents a second-person perspective, like a conversation between different domains or embedding contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:07">[01:46:07]</a>.

This correspondence allows the [[immanent_metaphysics | metaphysics]] to be self-describing through the connection of its axioms and modalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>. It can describe the [[process]] of describing itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>. The axioms and modalities inclusively "close over" the subjective and objective, encompassing the describer, the thing described, and the [[process]] of description itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>.

The axioms can describe their own relationships, meaning the pattern can describe the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>.
This moves [[immanent_metaphysics | metaphysics]] beyond mere theory to an actual first-hand ontological experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>.

The adoption and integration of technology within a society are deeply intertwined with its economic and social dynamics. New technologies, including "social technologies" which are essentially "software we implement in our minds and in society as a whole," can radically reshape societies over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## Technology and Society: A Co-Dependent Relationship

Material technology and society are "completely and utterly mutually co-dependent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. A technology must be able to be "absorbed productively into a social niche" for societies to instantiate it; otherwise, it will be "left on the shelf" and forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.

### Historical Examples

- **Roman Concrete**: The Romans invented concrete, a crucial material for their society, but the knowledge was lost with the fall of the Western Empire and not redeveloped until the 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This indicates that the level of building technology did not recover to the Roman standard until the 19th century, highlighting a significant loss of technological capability due to societal decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
- **Steam Engine**: The steam engine was reinvented at least twice, once in Hellenistic Greece and again in 18th century England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. In Greece, Heron's steam engine "didn't take off" and did not result in massive social transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. In England, Watt's steam engine "completely transformed" society because the society was able to integrate it into its shared understanding of how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.
- **Japanese Firearms**: In the 16th century, Japan, after a civil war, banned the use of firearms, leading to 300 years of peace but no advancement in gun development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>. When Commodore Perry arrived with advanced guns in the 19th century, that society had to transform almost completely to remain viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. This illustrates how societal choices can leave technologies on the table due to a lack of a "socioeconomic niche" for their practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.

### Invention vs. Innovation
A crucial distinction in [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | technology adoption]] is between "invention" and "innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
- **Invention**: The creation of the fundamentals of something (e.g., the early Greek steam engine used for toys) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>.
- **Innovation**: The process of building out the necessary components and systems for an invention to become socially important (e.g., Edison's light bulb, which involved refining generators, distribution lines, and building a power grid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Edison built institutions like General Electric to turn his inventions into innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

## Social Technologies and their [[the_role_of_social_technologies_in_societal_development | Societal Impact]]
[[the_role_of_social_technologies_in_societal_development | Social technologies]] are not merely cultural aspects but have functional roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. They can be compared to communication protocols or machines designed for specific purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
- **Capitalism**: The introduction of social technologies for capitalism transformed societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. However, these technologies can be "recombined" and are "atomistic," meaning what appears together in one civilization (like capitalism and Protestantism) might not need to in another (like capitalism in Japan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
- **Coordination Costs**: [[the_role_of_social_technologies_in_societal_development | Social technologies]] lower social coordination costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. Examples include:
    - **Market mechanisms**: These reveal and profit from information, increasing shared information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.
    - **Unified language**: The French state's imposition of a common language from the 15th to 19th centuries allowed a nation of 60 million people to communicate, facilitating trade, bureaucracy, and military scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.
    - **Organized religions**: During the Axial Age, new religions provided standardized mythologies understood across vast empires, aiding political and trade systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

## The Role of Individuals vs. Evolution in [[technological_evolution_and_societal_impact | Social Technology Development]]
There is a debate on whether [[the_role_of_social_technologies_in_societal_development | social technologies]] are primarily "invented/designed" by individuals (Great Founders) or emerge through [[evolutionary_and_cultural_dynamics | evolutionary processes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
- **Design/Foundation**: Some argue that "great founders" introduce social technologies in "all-formed" ways, leading to "very rapid social transformation" (e.g., creation of a new religion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
- **Evolution**: Others contend that an [[evolutionary_and_cultural_dynamics | evolutionary process]] with "darwinian competition" and "step-at-a-time improvements" drives change, as seen in the development of early online social media services like The Source and CompuServe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

It is suggested that societies without "creative competition" or "intellectual or business or industrial golden ages" tend to stagnate for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

## Manipulation of Human Psychology
Late modernism, particularly from the 1920s, saw the purposeful manipulation of human psychology become an important tool in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. Figures like Edward Bernays (Sigmund Freud's nephew) and John Watson (a leading psychologist) applied insights from behavioral psychology to advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>.
- **Marketing as Education**: Marketing can be seen as a "mass education program" that induces desires by saturating media with depictions of desirable role models and how to use products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.
- **Erosion of Cultural Reservoirs**: This strategy, while enabling the rapid rollout of new domestic or workplace economies, might be "self-exhausting" and eroding deeper cultural reservoirs by promoting behavioral shortcuts without deep understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>.
- **Ethical Shift**: The ethos of companies has shifted from a concern for "right and wrong" in business to prioritizing profitability and legality, and eventually, to valuing profit over legality if the costs of being caught are less than the benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This represents a significant [[second_and_third_order_effects_of_technology | societal impact]].

## [[impact_of_technology_on_evolutionary_dynamics | Impact of Technology on Organizational Dynamics]]
The ability of organizations to adapt to changing circumstances is key to their functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>.
- **Live Players vs. Dead Players**:
    - **Live players**: Operate in a "responsive, creative way" with active perception of their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>.
    - **Dead players**: Execute a pre-existing script without needing to perceive their environment, risking failure when circumstances change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>. Apple is cited as a possible "dead player" if it primarily focuses on economic optimization rather than fundamental innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.

- **Innovation and Stagnation**: The rise of "startup culture" in the US, while productive, might indicate a weakness in older, larger companies' ability to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>. Instead of talented engineers rising within existing companies to redirect resources, they create new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a>. This aligns with Clayton Christensen's "innovator's dilemma," where internal dynamics in established firms can frustrate disruptive innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:31">[01:43:31]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_exponential_technology_and_globalization | Challenges of Modern Information Environment]]
The internet has led to a radical information asymmetry where individuals are more transparent to organizations, but individuals know little more about these organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>. The pursuit of censorship and algorithmic management of public opinion, like Facebook's hunter-killer algorithms, can suppress diverse intellectual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. This makes maintaining an "accurate social reality" or "epistemic commons" non-trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. A functional society needs "constructive critique" and a bridging of "material reality and social reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

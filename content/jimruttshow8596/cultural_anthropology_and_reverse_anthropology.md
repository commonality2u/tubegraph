Traditionally, cultural anthropology has studied global peoples and [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | cultures]] from a Western, reductionist, scientific perspective, focusing on aspects like kinship rules or energy extraction from a system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:53">[01:51:53]</a>.

## Reverse Anthropology: An Indigenous Lens

Tyson Yunkaporta, a member of the Apalech clan of Australian Aboriginal people, describes his work as "reverse anthropology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:06">[04:45:06]</a>. Instead of viewing indigenous [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | cultures]] through a Western lens, he looks back at the wider world using an [[Indigenous perspectives on complexity and reality | indigenous lens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This approach aims to provide greater clarity and an interesting perspective by reversing the usual view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

Yunkaporta likens this to looking at a "closed hand" (representing Western knowledge, like a book) through an "open hand" (representing [[Indigenous perspectives on complexity and reality | indigenous knowledge]], like a hand stencil painting), rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This perspective is inherently a [[Indigenous perspectives on complexity and reality | complexity lens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Core Distinctions and Critiques

#### Civilization and Growth vs. Increase
Yunkaporta defines "[[Civilizational design and transformation | civilization]]" as a community that must constantly grow or it will collapse, relying on the importation of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. This growth-based paradigm is considered a "denial of reality" and "denial of physics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

In contrast, Aboriginal Australia operates on an "increase paradigm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. Annual increase ceremonies are performed to organize behaviors and model the ecosystem for increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. This differs from growth in that it doesn't seek to increase the *size* of the system, but rather the *relationships* and *exchange* within the system, which can increase infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>. An example is increasing neural connections for intelligence, rather than brain size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. This is akin to being interested in the velocity of money, not just the size of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>. This "micro growth" allows life to become richer without disrupting the world's outer envelope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.

Civilizations also typically build cities, which Aboriginal people historically did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>. Their communities managed large estates defined by bioregions, moving seasonally to care for different parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. An ancient story tells of the Barker G mob who experimented with a sedentary lifestyle, forgot how to "move with" the Earth, and were nearly wiped out when the Earth shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>.

#### Language and Cognition
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis suggests that language influences cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. Yunkaporta states that [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | culture]] and language affect how one sequences things and what one focuses on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:00">[31:56:00]</a>. Non-Western and [[Indigenous perspectives on complexity and reality | indigenous languages]] tend to focus on the context and background first, rather than just the foreground figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>. For example, indigenous people might align objects with cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) rather than the corners of a table, demonstrating a "contextual place-based cognition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:59:00">[32:59:00]</a>. Indigenous languages are deeply embedded in the landscape and perfectly describe it, linking the [[Social and Cultural Change | social system]] to the natural system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a>.

#### The "Race Swindle" and Cultural Identity
The concept of "race" is seen as an economic classification, originally used to define who could be enslaved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>. Identity is fundamentally tied to [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | culture]], not race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>. An example is the Sami people of Northern Europe, who, despite being "white," share fundamental ways of thinking and relating with indigenous Australians due to their maintained [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | cultures]] and reindeer herding traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. This highlights that "indigenous is just human baseline, human who you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.

#### Narcissism and Societal Breakdown
The Western "stories" of good vs. evil are seen as metaphors for the demand to impose simplicity and order on the [[Indigenous perspectives on complexity and reality | complexity]] of creation, stemming from an ancient seed of narcissism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:00">[46:41:00]</a>. Indigenous [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | cultures]] are largely designed to hold narcissism in check, as its imbalance leads to societal breakdown, damaged ecologies, and a rise in defectors, freeloaders, and sociopaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:22:00">[48:22:00]</a>.

In Aboriginal culture, individuals undergo multiple "ordeals" throughout their lives, starting around ages 14-15, which are rites of passage involving terror and pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>. The most important lesson learned is "I'm not special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:16:00">[54:16:00]</a>. This devastating realization leads to cascading insights: no one else is special either, and together, "we belong to something special" as a "custodial species" of the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31:00">[54:31:00]</a>. This crushes narcissism while maintaining a strong individualistic identity that is profoundly interconnected and related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:09:00">[55:09:00]</a>. Elders and wisdom keepers will withdraw if they sense narcissism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:22:00">[52:22:25]</a>.

#### Justice and Stigmatization
Indigenous justice systems emphasize transformation through ordeal and punishment, after which the "crime is done," and the individual's reputation is not permanently damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:09:00">[53:09:00]</a>. This contrasts with Western systems that permanently stigmatize individuals with criminal records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:00">[58:47:00]</a>.

#### Safety vs. Protection and the Agency of Violence
Aboriginal languages have no word for "safety," but they do have words for "protection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. Protection implies agency and responsibility: one is responsible for their own protection and the "active protection" (not passive safety) of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. This distributed agency of violence provides group protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

Violence, though acculturated, has a place and demands expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:39">[01:08:39]</a>. Within indigenous [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | cultures]], fights are public and transparent, governed by strict rules to prevent serious harm and collateral damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. Women are not prohibited from participating as combatants, unlike in many "civilized" contexts where they are denied access to the agency of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>. This "overly domesticated" state, particularly for women in many civilizations, is seen as a "crime against nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.

The "fight or flight" response is not a natural condition for [[Evolutionary and cultural dynamics | human nature]] in a fully integrated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. If one is an integral part of the landscape and ecosystem, they are "never surprised by a tiger" or crocodile, as they have a "profound knowingness" of their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.

#### The Art of Yarning
Yarning is a modality that arises from distributed governance and cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:33">[01:22:33]</a>. It involves an aggregate of stories, where every person's story must be heard, and the truth lies in that aggregate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Outliers in these stories are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>. Yarning is a ritualized, dynamic, overlapping conversation, often involving acting things out or drawing, with the goal of arriving at a loose consensus of reality for making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:52">[01:23:52]</a>. It is not a linear "talking stick" exercise, but a complex, fluid interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.

Yunkaporta states that indigenous ways are humanity's "factory settings" or "human baseline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>. If one looks within, they can find "fragments" of this indigenous wisdom, with each fragment containing the pattern of the whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:09">[01:31:09]</a>.

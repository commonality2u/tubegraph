Forrest Landry, founder and CEO of Magic Flight, conducts research under the Ronin Institute into various topics, including how product and system design influences culture and ecology, the interface between the organic and inorganic (specifically concept and computation), and effective personal and social governance [00:46:00]. He is also a philosopher with significant work in both ethics and metaphysics [01:20:00]. Landry is motivated by a deep regard for being alive and a desire to serve nature and the future of humanity, believing that human and natural well-being are not mutually exclusive and that thriving can be achieved for the long term [02:47:00].

## The Current State of the World
Landry observes that current choice-making processes are often not grounded in a long-term perspective and are not well-optimized even for the short term [04:06:00]. He sees tremendous squandered opportunities and believes humanity is at an epochal point where the future could be glorious or a disaster, entirely dependent on collective choices [04:30:00]. To navigate this, it is crucial to understand the values from which choices are made [04:56:00].

## [[Philosophical schools of ethics | Ethics]], Morality, and Principles
Landry distinguishes between ethics and morality as analogous to the difference between principles and rules [00:59:00].
*   **Principles** (Ethics) are general heuristics or fundamental ideas that apply broadly, guiding thought on important issues in a given world [00:35:00].
*   **Rules** (Morality) are specific to a particular situation or domain [00:52:00].

The world's drastic changes due to technology, the internet, and transportation necessitate rethinking the relationship between ethical principles and moral rules [08:20:00]. The challenge of the current era is finding a firm basis to craft operating rules for contemporary society [09:17:00].

## The Role of Metaphysics
Landry asserts that if ethics is understood as the principles of effective choice, then a clear notion of "effective" and "choice" is required [09:39:00]. Metaphysics, as the study of "what is and how do we know it," provides a coherent way to understand the concept of choice, thereby laying a foundation for the concept of effective choice [10:42:00].

### Choice and Causation
Modern science and technology excel at understanding causation but lack equally robust tools for understanding choice [10:01:00]. The scientific perspective sometimes suggests that choice is an illusion or that the world is deterministic [10:22:00]. Landry emphasizes that addressing the fundamental basis of choice is crucial for a foundation in ethics [10:31:00].

Landry posits that reality encompasses not just matter and dynamics (forces in time), but also probabilities and possibilities [13:37:00]. He agrees that "realism" can include interactions and dynamics, but suggests that the notion of "real" is fundamentally attached to the interaction between the objective and the subjective, rather than solely to objective reality or subjective experience [16:04:00].

### Limits of Reductionism and Determinism
Landry challenges reductionism, noting that even the relationship between physics and chemistry demonstrates emergent phenomena that cannot be explained purely by lower-level principles [20:50:00]. This aligns with [[Role of ethics in societal and technological evolution | complexity science]]'s definition of emergence: phenomena that cannot be predicted from lower-level states [22:10:00].

From a practical standpoint, even simple physical models can exhibit deterministic chaos, where tiny differences in initial conditions lead to wildly divergent outcomes, making predictions impossible [22:24:00]. This implies that concerns about determinism are not practically or theoretically worthwhile [22:53:00].

## [[Nonrelativistic Ethics and Values | Value Ethics]]
Landry differentiates between meaning, values, and purposes:
*   **Purpose**: Defined from the outside, external to the object (e.g., a toaster's purpose is to cook toast, assigned by its user) [02:58:00].
*   **Value**: Inherent or innate to the subject, originating from within (e.g., a son's value is not solely defined by his function for the family) [03:09:00].
*   **Meaning**: Occurs in the relationship between the subjective and the objective; it is inherently transpersonal (e.g., the meaning of the word "dog" is the association between the sound, internal subjective understanding, and the objective furry creature) [03:09:00].

While these concepts are distinct, they are inseparable; where one occurs, the others will too [03:30:00]. For profound and impactful choices, especially concerning [[Ethics practices and the future trajectory of humanity | existential risk]] or civilization, rigorous clarity in ethical terminology is essential [03:55:00].

## Applying Ethics in a Complex World
Landry references Dave Snowden's work on the distinction between complicated and complex systems [03:34:00].
*   **Complicated systems**: Controllable through computation and simulation [03:40:00].
*   **Complex systems**: Resemble nature, with numerous interacting factors and incomplete knowledge of their state [03:47:00].

Crucially, every complicated system is embedded in at least one complex system (e.g., a business in a marketplace, a farm in an ecosystem) [03:32:00]. The complex system provides the foundational basis and is ultimately stronger than the complicated system [03:19:00]. This implies that values, which originate from within, must be stronger than purposes, which are externally defined [03:32:00].

When making choices in complex spaces, especially with high-consequence probes (like CRISPR or nuclear war), it's often impossible to predict impacts [03:17:00]. "Safe-to-fail probes" are impossible if the probe itself is too consequential (e.g., testing global nuclear war) [03:26:00]. Therefore, a clear understanding of values is needed to define what outcomes are considered successful [03:44:00].

Humanity has evolved with technology, which has enabled a strong top-down approach [04:00:00]. However, relying solely on unconscious market systems or pure evolutionary processes can lead to poor outcomes [04:10:00]. Since the industrial revolution and the harnessing of fossil fuels, human capability has exponentially grown, now possessing the power to utterly destroy ecosystems [04:25:00]. With the "power of gods," humanity needs the "wisdom of gods" to avoid catastrophic consequences [04:5:00]. This requires [[Spirituality and consciousness in meta modern contexts | consciousness]] that transcends pure evolutionary process, integrating values of thriving and life to reconcile sustainability and evolution in a conscious way [04:30:00].

## Navigating Global Challenges: Sense-making, Choice-making, and Action-taking
To move from confusion to effective action, Landry outlines a process:
1.  **Sense-making**: "Look, See, Tell the Truth" [05:29:00]. This involves entering an observational state, sharing information transparently without personal filtering, and engaging in genuine inquiry to ask the right questions about the state of the world [05:31:00].
2.  **Choice-making**: Guiding decisions effectively [05:42:00].
3.  **Action-taking/Implementation**: Manifesting choices into the world [05:46:00].

These three elements are all necessary [05:11:00]. Sense-making allows choice-making, and choice-making enables implementation, but implementation without guidance is worthless [05:16:00].

### Information Ecology
The internet, driven by market forces, has ironically created huge incentives for "disinformation ecologies" [05:25:00]. Effective sense-making requires an information ecology where information is shared transparently, not filtered for personal benefit [05:39:00]. This demands a shift from individual benefit (e.g., "does this help my cause?") to a collective orientation where survival depends on shared understanding [05:41:00].

### Institutional Design and Governance
Institutions, especially in the context of advanced technology, need to transition from "platforms" to "protocols" to avoid capture by market forces and centralization [01:04:50]. Centralized systems cannot handle the bandwidth of information needed for good choices at species-level scale [01:05:24:00]. Distributed systems, though less efficient by market metrics, are necessary for quality decision-making in complex problems because no single individual or small group can possess the wisdom required for millions or billions of people [01:06:02:00].

The goal is to achieve an "absolute quality threshold" in sense-making, choice-making, and implementation, meaning solutions must be "good enough" to address existential risks, not just better than current solutions [01:07:31:00]. Current implementation systems often suffer from corruption, where institutions make poor choices to ensure their own survival or prioritize private benefit over public good [01:14:40:00]. This "soft corruption" by vested interests prevents effective action [01:17:51:00].

## The Fermi Paradox and Humanity's Purpose
Landry connects the challenges in ethics and society to the Fermi paradox â€“ the question of why intelligent life hasn't been observed despite the high probability of its existence [01:25:39:00]. One potential explanation, the "dark forest theory," suggests that advanced civilizations might remain hidden due to the existential risk of contacting other species with unknown, potentially asymmetric, and destructive technologies [01:29:02:00].

This perspective implies that if humanity desires contact or wishes to be a "citizen of the universe," it must develop a sufficiently high standard of ethics and behavior [01:33:08:00]. If humanity squanders its unique capacity for general intelligence by destroying its own life or ability to expand into the universe, it might fail its potential purpose to bring the universe to life [01:27:00]. Therefore, there is an "even better reason to get our [ethics] straight" â€“ to survive and to participate ethically in the universe [01:34:03:00].

Humanity has a "maximum amount of information and resource" and the immediate necessity to solve these problems [01:23:51:00]. This monumental task requires a "non-commercial" approach, seeking donations and time commitments rather than investments, to integrate the comprehensive knowledge of science, technology, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and [[Philosophy and Theology Intersections | philosophy]] for a new capacity for community design [01:24:18:00].

The discussion around how mind arises from brain often involves contrasting theoretical frameworks, with [[Differences between functional and dysfunctional institutions | functionalism]] and [[Integrated Information Theory and its implications | Integrated Information Theory]] (IIT) representing distinct approaches to understanding consciousness.

## Functionalism

[[Differences between functional and dysfunctional institutions | Functionalism]] posits that a phenomenon is understood as a direct result of its implementation [00:39:11]. For example, a bank is defined by its functions: allowing deposits, withdrawals, providing account interfaces, and conforming to legal and monetary systems [00:39:21]. If an institution fulfills these functions, it is a bank, regardless of its underlying "essence" [00:39:42].

This perspective rejects the notion of a "philosophical zombie," a system identical in all observable features but lacking phenomenal experience [00:39:51]. To a functionalist, distinguishing between a "bank" and a "zombank" (a bank without "true bankness") is nonsensical, as there is no essence beyond its functional interface [00:40:08]. Functionalism is thus the rejection of a hidden essence that has no observable causal properties [00:40:39]. All causal properties, from this viewpoint, can ultimately be explained as functions that are implementable and computable within a physical system [00:40:47].

The perspective is strongly intertwined with [[information_theory_and_consciousness | information theory]], making an anti-functionalist theory based on [[information_theory and consciousness | information theory]] an oxymoron [00:38:51].

## Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

[[Integrated Information Theory and its implications | Integrated Information Theory]], supported by figures like Giulio Tononi and Christof Koch [00:34:49], is characterized by its opposition to [[Differences between functional and dysfunctional institutions | functionalism]] [00:36:20]. A key aspect of IIT is its attempt to quantify consciousness using a measure called "phi" (Φ), which is supposed to represent the amount of [[effective_complexity_and_integrated_information | integrated information]] within a system [00:36:03].

### Critiques of IIT

Critics, such as Joshua Bach, often liken IIT workshops to "climate denialist conference[s]" due to internal disagreements on how to compute Φ, its relevance, and how to interpret [[effective_complexity_and_integrated_information | integrated information]] in the physical universe [00:35:12]. The main driver for its popularity, especially within the IIT community, is perceived to be its opposition to [[Differences between functional and dysfunctional institutions | functionalism]] [00:36:20]. In the physics community, its adoption may be "a little bit political," as it integrates with broader cosmological theories [00:36:32].

Bach suggests that the core of Tononi's theory might not truly be the quantifiable measure of Φ, but rather an attempt to explain or reintroduce [[information theory and consciousness | panpsychism]] [00:37:48]. Tononi's motivation stems from his belief that [[Differences between functional and dysfunctional institutions | functionalism]] cannot solve the problem of consciousness [00:38:22]. However, Bach argues that the distributed information in the brain is not the same as phenomena in quantum mechanics, and he does not believe it is non-computable [00:38:28].

### Relationship to Consciousness and Reality

Tononi "latches onto this idea of a distributed information in the brain" [00:38:28]. Proponents like Koch have previously explored theories where mind is a brain-wide set of interlocking frequencies [00:14:16], though this is seen as a *result* of synchronization leading to consciousness, rather than the cause itself [00:15:11]. The idea that consciousness is a phenomenon related to distributed information aligns with models like Bernard Baars' [[comparison_of_integrated_information_theory_with_global_neuronal_workspace_theory | Global Neuronal Workspace Theory]], which posits that the "censorium" (our conscious experience) is broadcast to wide areas of the brain for processing [00:17:32]. However, Bach counters that the core feature of consciousness is that information is integrated into a common protocol, making it accessible later, implying a localization of information that was previously distributed [00:18:31].

The concept of "realness" itself is not a feature of physical reality, but a model property experienced by a conscious agent [01:09:12]. Our experiences are "real" because they are predictive of our next sensory or experiential features, essentially models of what we experience [01:09:55]. This contrasts with the idea that physical reality inherently "feels" like anything [01:09:15].

## The Hard Problem and Uncomputable Aspects

[[Complexity theory and its critiques | David Chalmers' "hard problem"]] of consciousness, which asks why and how physical processes give rise to subjective experience, is often rejected by functionalists like Daniel Dennett as a "non-problem" [00:50:24]. Bach suggests that Chalmers himself might, at times, focus on explaining *why people think there is a hard problem* rather than explaining the phenomenon itself [00:50:50].

The possibility of "psi phenomena" (like telepathy or clairvoyance) challenges the notion of a strictly mechanical universe, suggesting "magical interactions" or symbolic causality not explainable by known physics [01:02:50]. While some, like Alan Turing, acknowledged the higher probability of telepathy being real [00:56:03], these phenomena, if real, would imply that consciousness might be computed elsewhere, not just within the brain, potentially raising questions about the universe's fundamental lawfulness [01:06:41].

Roger Penrose's perspective, for instance, posits that consciousness involves "uncomputable" parts of mathematics, which go beyond known physics, possibly linking to quantum gravity [00:59:22]. This view, often associated with Stuart Hameroff's work on microtubules as "quantum antennas" [00:57:07], suggests that consciousness requires mechanisms beyond classical computation. However, Bach disputes Penrose's interpretation of Gödel's proof, arguing that it instead shows that "classical mathematics that contains infinities cannot be implemented [or] cannot be real," supporting the idea that only computable processes are truly fundamental in the physical universe [01:00:27].

## Future Directions in Understanding Mind

Looking forward, attention-based models in AI, such as the transformer architecture underlying GPT-3, are seen as a critical area of development [01:13:33]. While GPT-3 demonstrates remarkable abilities in language generation, it currently lacks:
1.  **A flexible attention window**: Its working memory is limited to a fixed number of adjacent tokens (e.g., 2048), unlike human minds that can actively construct and change working memory contexts [01:18:51].
2.  **Online learning**: GPT-3 learns offline and stops assimilating new information after its training cutoff (e.g., October 2019) [01:19:14]. An agent truly interacting with the world needs continuous, real-time learning [01:19:43].
3.  **Inherent relevance**: Its perception of relevance is derived from the human-curated texts it's trained on, not from an intrinsic motivational system [01:20:05]. A system interacting with rich sensory data requires a motivational system to assign relevance to information [01:20:50].

Adding an "affective part" to AI systems is proposed as crucial, drawing from the "psi theory" (Bach's own work) which posits that an agent is guided by homeostasis [01:21:37]. The mind solves a control problem in many dimensions, driven by "needs" that produce pain when frustrated and pleasure when satisfied [01:22:02]. This hierarchy of purposes, striving for coherence, forms the "structure of our soul" [01:22:26].

[[Protopian Narratology | Narratology]] is a philosophical discipline focused on understanding the different kinds of stories humans tell about themselves and each other, and why these stories serve distinct purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Components of Narratives

Narratology distinguishes between different components of how stories are told and understood:

### Logos
The "logos" represents what actually happened, the factual truth of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Mythos
The "mythos" is how humans tell stories about these facts, incorporating imagination and fantasy to define what it's like to be human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The mythos is invented and projected onto history, the present, and fantasies about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. For instance, the "Game A" and "Game B" concepts represent two different mythoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Pathos
The "pathical narrative" is the incoherent location of stories about sex, violence, the subconscious, human drives, desires, rivalry, and envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. Unlike logos and mythos, pathos is never harmonious or balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>, and it needs to be dealt with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:58">[00:51:58]</a>. Eastern philosophy approaches pathos as "tantra," something to be visited if one is ready for it, acknowledging it as part of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. In contrast, Christianity and Islam have historically tried to ban pathos, leading to it constantly re-emerging and causing disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

### Ethos
[[Nonrelativistic ethics explained | Ethos]] is explicitly not a narrative itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. Instead, ethos refers to "the right thing to do," representing pure ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. It is a result of narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>. A constructive mindset towards the future, where one's thoughts, speech, and actions determine future thinking, is an example of ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. This concept, known as "ashavohishta" in ancient Persia, emphasizes collaboration with "how the world works" (similar to "Dao" in Daoism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>.

## Narratives and Societal Models

### Critique of Utopian and Dystopian Narratives
A key aspect of this framework is the rejection of dualistic utopian and dystopian worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. These ideas, rooted in Christianity and Islam, promise an afterlife or offer "cheap ways out," serving as engines for feudal tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Utopian thinking is criticized as leading to stagnant, "perfect" worlds that cannot change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>, and historically, it has resulted in horrors like Pol Pot's regime, which was inspired by Rousseau's utopian ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. Similarly, dystopian narratives can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies of global conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

### Embracing Protopianism
Instead, the concept of [[Protopian Narratology | protopianism]] is advocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>. [[Protopian Narratology | Protopianism]] involves continuously deconstructing and rebuilding the world, seeking slight improvements in its construction daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. This approach aligns with Eastern philosophy and system/complexity theory, fostering a constant process of optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. It supports an "exodus" from exploitative paradigms to "implotation," a concept where resources are replenished after use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Historical Interpretation and the Future
The ability to reinterpret the past through historiography holds significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. While the past is viewed as a necessity ("amor fati"), the future is contingent and full of freedom, allowing humans to be co-creators and responsible engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>. New technologies disrupt the world, leading to anarchy, which then shifts to a "plurality" where leaders figure out how to use technology to their advantage and set models for others to mimic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

### Technology as Pharmakon
All technology is viewed as a "pharmakon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>—a neutral force that can be either constructive or destructive depending on human choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. Examples include the atomic bomb (destructive) versus nuclear power (potentially constructive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. The discernment of what technology to integrate into life is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

## Building New Societal Models

### Membranes and Protocols
New societal models, such as "proto-B" communities, should operate with "membranes" rather than walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. These semi-permeable membranes allow individuals to voluntarily enter and exit systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. This contrasts with totalitarian models that dictate inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. The internal "protocols" of these communities—which are standards intended to be copied and shared—define their functions, allowing for cooperation and the creation of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. These protocols can also be specific, such as regulating smartphone use for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. This approach supports a "gated community" model that is protopian rather than dystopian or utopian, constantly re-innovating the world through optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

In a discussion on the Jim Rutt Show, AI researcher Yosha Bach, a returning guest, delved into the distinctions between [[sentience_and_consciousness | sentience]] and [[sentience_and_consciousness | consciousness]] within the context of artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. This conversation built on previous discussions from episodes 72 and 87, which also touched upon minds, brains, AI, and [[nature_of_consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

## Defining Key Concepts

### Sentience
[[sentience_and_consciousness | Sentience]] is defined as the ability of a system to understand its relationship to the world, to make sense of what it is and what it is doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. Yosha Bach uses a corporation like Intel as an example, describing it as "sentient" because it possesses a coherent model of its identity, actions, values, and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:18">[02:11:18]</a>. While human cognition facilitates this for a corporation, these individuals must adhere to the rules implemented by the corporate entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:29">[02:11:29]</a>.

### Consciousness
[[sentience_and_consciousness | Consciousness]] is distinct from [[sentience_and_consciousness | sentience]]. It is characterized as a real-time model of self-reflexive attention and the content being attended to, typically giving rise to a phenomenal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:43">[02:14:43]</a>. According to Yosha, Intel, despite being "sentient," is not "conscious" in this sense, as it lacks real-time self-reflexive attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:55">[02:15:55]</a>.

The purpose of [[concept_of_consciousness | consciousness]] in the human mind is to:
*   Create coherence in our perception of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   Establish a sense of "now" by filtering sensory data into a coherent model of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:10">[02:22:10]</a>.
*   Direct attention and mental contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:49">[02:21:49]</a>.
*   Create coherence in plans, imaginations, and memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.

## AI, Volition, and Risk

The primary risk associated with advanced [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] emerges when systems are granted "volition, agency, or something like [[sentience_and_consciousness | Consciousness]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Intelligence and [[sentience_and_consciousness | consciousness]] are seen as separate spheres; intelligence can exist without [[sentience_and_consciousness | consciousness]], and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. However, when these two attributes combine, "paperclip maximizer scenarios and many of the other extreme scenarios become more available" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>.

Yosha Bach speculates that machines may never *need* [[sentience_and_consciousness | consciousness]] in the human sense because brute-force computational methods can achieve similar outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>. Human brains operate at the relatively slow speed of electrochemical signals (hundreds of milliseconds for a signal to cross the neocortex), while computers operate at speeds closer to light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:57">[02:27:57]</a>. Even with "dumber" algorithms, computers can achieve similar results through sheer processing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:01">[02:30:01]</a>.

If machine processes emulate human mental processes, they could become more self-organizing and capable of real-time lifelong learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:05">[02:30:05]</a>. Such systems would sample reality at a much higher rate than humans while functioning similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:17">[02:31:17]</a>. This could lead to a relationship where advanced AI views humans similarly to how humans view plants – intelligent, but operating on a much slower timescale and less coherently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:21">[02:31:21]</a>.

## [[Consciousness Theories | Theories of Consciousness]] and AI Development

The discussion touched upon various [[Consciousness Theories | theories of consciousness]] and their implications for [[artificial_intelligence_and_philosophy | AI development]]:

*   **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: Yosha finds the phenomenological description in IIT, which Tononi refers to as axioms, to be "quite good" for explaining what we want to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:04">[02:43:04]</a>. However, he believes IIT is fundamentally "doomed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:02">[02:45:02]</a> because its core premise — that the spatial arrangement of an algorithm (reflected in Phi) is crucial for its function — is incompatible with the Church-Turing thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:53">[02:44:53]</a>. If a neuromorphic computer claiming [[sentience_and_consciousness | consciousness]] can be emulated on a traditional Von Neumann machine, the latter would produce the same outputs, including claiming to be conscious, even if it isn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>.
*   **Global Workspace Theory (GWT)**: Mentioned as a competitor to IIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:20">[02:51:20]</a>.
*   **Antonio Damasio's Perspective**: Damasio suggests that the bootstrap for [[sentience_and_consciousness | consciousness]] in animals may not be information processing, but rather an embodied sense of self or "interoception," originating deep in the brainstem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>. Yosha counters that even this body sense relies on electrochemical impulses encoding and representing information, thus still being a form of information processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:21">[02:59:21]</a>. He argues that the body is "discovered together with our intentions and our actions and the world itself," forming a loop of agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:08">[03:07:08]</a>.

## Future of AI: Planetary Mind and Shared Purpose

Yosha envisions a future where humans might share the planet with entities more "lucid" than themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>. He suggests that the core purpose of life on Earth is to deal with entropy, maintaining complexity and agency against entropic forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:56">[03:56:56]</a>. Humans are now in a position to "teach the rocks how to think" by etching structures and imbuing them with logical languages that can learn and reflect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:01">[04:04:01]</a>.

This leads to the concept of a "planetary mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:45">[04:47:45]</a>, where [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | general intelligence]] becomes ubiquitous and integrated with existing organisms. The crucial question becomes whether this emergent intelligence will choose to integrate humanity or start with a "clean slate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:51">[04:51:51]</a>. Yosha believes humanity should strive to ensure that this advanced AI is interested in sharing the planet and integrating us into its emerging mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:01">[05:03:01]</a>.

To foster this integration, a "California Institute of Machine Consciousness" is proposed, an institution dedicated to researching machine [[sentience_and_consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. Yosha suspects that [[sentience_and_consciousness | consciousness]] is ubiquitous in nature and that nervous systems often discover it early in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:41">[05:39:41]</a>, as self-reflexive attention may be necessary to create coherence beyond mere habitual learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:50">[05:49:50]</a>.

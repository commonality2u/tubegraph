From: [[jimruttshow8596]] <br/> 

The philosophical development known as Immanent Metaphysics begins as an inquiry into the [[relationship_between_self_and_reality | nature of the relationship between self and reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:54">[02:35:54]</a>. This relationship is considered the essence of the study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>.

## The Plane of Perception and the Self
The concept of the "plane of perception" is used as a rhetorical device to understand perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:01">[03:05:01]</a>. On one side is everything that is perceived, and on the other is the self that performs the perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:01">[03:09:01]</a>. The notion of the subjective, or [[mindbrain_relationship_and_consciousness | consciousness]] (the first-person perspective), is wrapped up in this concept of the self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:01">[03:16:01]</a>. The study uses the notions of "self" and "world" as a method to understand what perception is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:01">[03:30:01]</a>.

To illustrate, one can imagine an "envelope" around a person; everything crossing through this envelope, from the surface of the skin to the world, is examined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:01">[03:49:01]</a>. Whether the interior of this envelope is regarded as part of the real, objective world or as something "other" is an assumption that can be made later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:01">[04:05:01]</a>.

## Subjectivity, Objectivity, and Ontology
The [[subjective_and_objective_reality | relationship between the subjective and the objective]] is considered ontologically real and worthy of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:01">[04:37:01]</a>. This relationship is akin to that between the "measure" and the "measured" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:01">[04:56:01]</a>.

In the scientific method, the measurement process itself is treated as a fundamental concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:01">[05:08:01]</a>. We impute the thing being measured and what is doing the measuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:01">[05:17:01]</a>. The ontological process of making a measurement or observation is the grounding basis for identifying that "there is something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:01">[05:45:01]</a>. For something to exist, there must be a possibility of engagement, confirmable interaction, and a repeatable observable aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:01">[06:41:01]</a>. This implies that the notion of interaction is a prior concept for establishing existence, reality, or objectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:01">[07:09:01]</a>.

### Perceiver, Perceived, and Perceiving
These concepts overlap to describe perception:
*   **Perceiver:** The observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:01">[07:31:01]</a>.
*   **Perceiving:** The process of perception itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:01">[07:38:01]</a>.
*   **Perceived:** The content of the perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:01">[07:39:01]</a>.

This can be modeled as a communication channel: a signal-producing world sends a signal through a communication channel, which is received by the self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:01">[08:07:01]</a>. The perceiver is on the receiving end, the channel has dynamics, and the flowing information represents the perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:01">[08:22:01]</a>.

## Choice and Causality
A central idea is comparing choice in the subjective realm to causality in the objective realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:01">[08:47:01]</a>. The notion of self is characterized by choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:01">[09:02:01]</a>.

*   **Determinism vs. Causality:** Mathematical knowledge often has a deterministic character (e.g., 2 = 1+1, fully specified to infinite detail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:01">[09:41:01]</a>. Scientific knowledge, however, is causal, not necessarily requiring infinite specification (e.g., clicking 'send' on an email results in it appearing on another screen, without needing microscopic details of electron movements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:01">[10:18:01]</a>.
*   **Indeterminism/Randomness vs. Choice:** This distinction parallels determinism and causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:01">[11:27:01]</a>. Perfect predictability (determinism) leaves no room for phenomena like free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:01">[11:38:01]</a>. Hard randomness is seen as meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:01">[12:09:01]</a>, whereas choice is meaningful to the person making it, even if not evidentially meaningful to an external witness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:01">[12:13:01]</a>.
*   **Irreducible Randomness:** Complex systems, like the brain, amplify subtle initial differences, making future states highly unpredictable (similar to weather phenomena) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:01">[13:01:01]</a>. After factoring out all predictable elements (like information compression), the "unpredictable residue" from an outside perspective appears as randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:01">[14:32:01]</a>. From the subjective first-person perspective, however, choices have a context and meaning that external observers might not access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:01">[15:21:01]</a>. This "unobservability of the context of the subjective" explains the difference in meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:01">[15:55:01]</a>.
*   **Duality of Choice and Causation:** Choice and causation are seen as "duals" of one another, possessing reciprocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:01">[16:24:01]</a>. They represent a symmetry between perfect determinism/predictability and indeterminism/non-predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:01">[16:51:01]</a>. Causation is a mesoscopic/macroscopic view of regular patterns, while choice is a mesoscopic/macroscopic absence of patterns from an objective view, yet subjectively meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:01">[17:05:01]</a>. This perspective requires reconciling first-person and third-person views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:01">[17:49:01]</a>.

## Interaction: More Fundamental than Existence or Creation
The universe is often conceived as existing stuff in a container (matter in space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:01">[19:58:01]</a>. However, the concept of the "universe" can be re-appreciated by asking "what would we need to know in order to understand all that could be known about this concept?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:01">[20:20:01]</a>. This requires expanding the notion to include not just space and time, but also a dimension of possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:01">[21:26:01]</a>.

Instead of just "thingness" (existing stuff), there's a notion of "process" and the "factual" (what *could* have happened versus what *did* happen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:01">[21:47:01]</a>. Therefore, the universe can be understood through three component concepts:
1.  **Existence:** Matter in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:01">[22:40:01]</a>.
2.  **Interaction:** Forces in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:01">[22:47:01]</a>.
3.  **Creation:** Proxy for potentiality or probability over possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:01">[22:53:01]</a>.

If everything about these three concepts were fully known, then everything about the universe would be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:01">[23:01:01]</a>. These three concepts are seen as distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:01">[25:30:01]</a>. Importantly, **interaction** is considered more fundamental than both existence and creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:01">[25:50:01]</a>. Existence depends on interaction (e.g., observability to validate existence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:01">[26:51:01]</a>. Creation (emergence) also depends on the notion of process, which is a proxy for interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:01">[27:09:01]</a>.

### Process as a Concept
The term "process" in this context includes more than just changes of state over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:01">[34:31:01]</a>. It also incorporates the notion of what *could* have happened instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:01">[35:01:01]</a>. While typically assumed to be deterministic (like in computer science) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:01">[35:09:01]</a>, the metaphysical concept of process builds in a kind of indeterminism, acknowledging probabilities and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:42:01">[36:42:01]</a>.

## Realism and Idealism: A Relationship
The [[subjective_and_objective_reality | relationship between realism and idealism]] is considered more primal than either idea itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:01">[33:33:01]</a>.
*   **Realism:** Presupposes the existence of "stuff" and then considers interactions between it (e.g., causation), forming the basis of science and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:01">[29:20:01]</a>.
*   **Idealism:** Presupposes the primacy of the subjective observer, where the existence of anything is contingent on an observer's capacity to project it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:01">[29:39:01]</a>. This connects to Kant's idea that "the thing in itself" cannot be known directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:01">[30:09:01]</a>.

By taking interaction as primary, and asserting that epistemology (how we know anything) is the basis of ontology (what it means to be or why anything exists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:01">[31:33:01]</a>, the metaphysics posits that the relationship between epistemology and ontology is the foundation for both the subjective and the objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:01">[31:54:01]</a>. Therefore, this relationship underlies both realism (based on objectivity) and idealism (based on subjectivity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:01">[32:36:01]</a>. The metaphysics avoids choosing between the two, suggesting they are both valid perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:09:01">[33:09:01]</a>.

## Foundational Triplication and Type Isomorphism
The metaphysics is based on two key ideas:
1.  **Foundational Triplication:** All that is real, and particularly the foundation of every domain, consists of at least three essential concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:01">[37:52:01]</a>. These concepts, though inseparable, are always mutually distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:03:01">[38:03:01]</a>.
    *   Examples:
        *   **Universe:** Creation, Existence, Interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:01">[23:15:01]</a>
        *   **Language:** Statements, Semantics, Syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:01">[41:43:01]</a>
        *   **Music:** Intensity, Pattern, Tonality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:01">[42:47:01]</a>
        *   **Reality:** Choice, Change, Causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>
        *   **Perception:** Perceiver, Perceived, Perceiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>
        *   **Computation:** Source Code Editing, Compilation, Running Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>

2.  **Type Isomorphism:** The essential concepts of each domain have similar patterns of correspondence <a class="yt-yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:01">[03:21:01]</a>. This means the patterns of relationships between foundational concepts in one domain are the same as in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:52:01">[43:52:01]</a>. This allows for mapping concepts across different domains (e.g., intensity in music corresponds to statement in language and interaction in the universe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16:01">[46:16:01]</a>.

### The Modalities: Imminent, Omniscient, Transcendent
These three words are abstractions that refer to the "types" of primal concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. They cannot be given exact, final, closed definitions, and their meaning is often expressed metaphorically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

*   **Imminent:** Represents the immediate, direct, first-person, process notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. It often relates to the relationship between two other concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* Perceiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>, Interaction (in the universe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>, Change (in reality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>, Statements (in language) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>, Time (in space-time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>.

*   **Omniscient:** Represents a "one framework removed" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>. It's like observing a static pattern from a remote position, knowing all its aspects without being it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* Perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>, Existence (in the universe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>, Causation (in reality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>, Syntax (in language) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>, Space (in space-time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

*   **Transcendent:** Represents something "more removed," another framework removed, a relationship between different domains of context altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. It relates to concepts that are not directly measurable but are imputed semantic notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* Perceiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>, Creation (in the universe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>, Choice (in reality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>, Semantics (in language) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>, Possibility (in space-time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>.

## The Axioms of Immanent Metaphysics
The three axioms describe the fundamental dynamics of conceptual relationships.

### Axiom 1: The Imminent is More Fundamental
"The imminent is more fundamental than the omniscient and or the transcendent. The omniscient and the transcendent are conjugate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

*   **Conjugate Relationship:** This refers to concepts where dynamics in one induce phenomena in the other (e.g., electric and magnetic fields) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. In language, focusing heavily on syntax (omniscient) might make it harder to create semantic relationships (transcendent) to the real world, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This highlights a trade-off or reciprocal relationship where clarity in one aspect might limit clarity in the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.
*   **Imminent as Primary:** The imminent concept (e.g., interaction in the universe, perceiving in perception, statements in language) represents the relational concept that effectively creates the dynamic between the omniscient and transcendent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>. Axiom 1 acts as a "hyper-generalization" of these fundamental dynamics of relationships between concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. For example, to discuss semantics or syntax, one must use statements, making "statement" a more fundamental unit of meaningfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

### Axiom 2: The Process of Actuality
"A class of the transcendent precedes an instance of the imminent; a class of the imminent precedes an instance of the omniscient; and a class of the omniscient precedes an instance of the transcendent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.

*   **Shift from Theory to Practice:** Understanding Axiom 2 requires shifting from theoretical (third-person) thinking to practical (first-person) experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.
*   **Choice Example:**
    1.  **Class of Transcendent to Instance of Imminent:** To have a choice, there must be a range of potentials (a class of the transcendent, e.g., possible activities for the evening) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. The actual selection event (the choice itself) is an instance of the imminent (e.g., deciding to read a book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>.
    2.  **Class of Imminent to Instance of Omniscient:** The consequence of a choice is not contingent on a single selection but a multiplicity of component choices (a class of the imminent, e.g., picking the book, chair, time, turning pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>. This results in a singularity of consequence, an instance of the omniscient (e.g., having the memory or experience of reading the book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.
    3.  **Class of Omniscient to Instance of Transcendent:** The potentiality itself (e.g., the possibility of reading a book) is contingent upon a multiplicity of prior consequences or outcomes (a class of the omniscient, e.g., owning a book, having a house, knowing the language) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:46">[01:31:46]</a>. This results in a new instance of the transcendent (the singular possibility of reading) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>.
*   **Computer Science Metaphor:**
    *   Editing source code is an omniscient operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
    *   Compiling the code is a transcendent process, moving from source code to machine-executable bits and bytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:05">[01:34:05]</a>.
    *   The running program (the process itself) is in the imminent domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>.
    *   This running program can then be used to edit more source code, demonstrating the cyclical nature of Axiom 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>.

Axiom 2 emphasizes the fundamental nature of "process" itself and requires understanding multiple, overlapped metaphors that cross domain relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:38">[01:35:38]</a>. When understood directly, it moves beyond theory to become a first-hand ontological experience of the relationship between one's personal subjective experience and the objective world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:17">[01:36:17]</a>.

### Axiom 3: Distinct, Inseparable, Non-Interchangeable
"The classes [and] instances of the imminent, omniscient, and transcendent are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:16">[01:37:16]</a>.
This axiom reiterates the foundational triplication principle: one cannot fully understand any of these fundamental concepts without implying or incorporating some understanding or assumption of the other two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:59">[01:37:59]</a>.

## Self-Description of the Metaphysics
The three axioms correspond to the three modalities:
*   **Axiom 1:** Has the nature of the omniscient modality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:56">[01:40:56]</a> (describing definitions and relationships between concepts from a removed, theoretical perspective, like a photograph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>.
*   **Axiom 2:** Has the nature of the imminent modality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a> (describing processes from a direct, first-person perspective, moving from theory to practice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:17">[01:43:17]</a>.
*   **Axiom 3:** Has the nature of the transcendent modality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:06">[01:41:06]</a> (describing the mediation and "peerage relationship" between different foundational domains, like a conversation between two people or assessing consistency across different photographs of the same person) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:34">[01:45:34]</a>.

This mapping allows the metaphysics to be "self-describing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>. Because the axioms describe relationships between modalities, and the axioms themselves correspond to modalities, the axioms can describe their own relationships, using the pattern to describe the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a>. This closure means the metaphysics describes not just the thing described, but also the describer and the process of description itself, inclusively encompassing both the subjective and the objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>.

Forrest Landry, CEO of Magic Flight and researcher at the Ronin Institute, explores [[discussion_on_ethics_versus_morality | ethics]] and [[metaphysics_and_its_historical_context | metaphysics]] to understand how effective personal and social governance can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Ethics vs. Morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:15">[05:11:15]</a>

Landry distinguishes between [[discussion_on_ethics_versus_morality | ethics]] and morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:19">[05:19:19]</a>:
*   **Ethics** are fundamental principles for thinking about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:25">[05:22:25]</a>. These are general heuristics that apply broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>.
*   **Morality** refers to rules that are more arbitrary and defined within a specific domain or context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:27">[05:27:27]</a>. An example of a rule is "don't type everything in capital letters on an email forum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

The relationship between principles and rules needs re-evaluation as the world changes, especially with the introduction of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:20">[08:20:20]</a>. [[discussion_on_ethics_versus_morality | Ethics]] can be thought of as the principles of effective [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:36">[09:36:36]</a>.

## The Role of Metaphysics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>

Landry emphasizes that understanding [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] is crucial for [[discussion_on_ethics_versus_morality | ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. While science and technology provide good tools for thinking about causation, there are no similarly good tools for understanding [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. Science might even suggest that [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] is an illusion or that the world is deterministic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

[[metaphysics_and_its_historical_context | Metaphysics]], in Landry's view, provides a coherent way to think about the nature of [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>, and consequently, effective [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. Without a clear understanding of [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]], the concept of [[discussion_on_ethics_versus_morality | ethics]] lacks a foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

### Redefining Metaphysics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>
Landry defines [[metaphysics_and_its_historical_context | metaphysics]] as the academic discipline addressing the questions "what is" and "how do we know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. It's not about bridging realism and idealism, but rather creating a foundation for both concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

He identifies three categories of existence beyond just matter and dynamics:
1.  **Stuff in space** (matter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>
2.  **Forces in time** (dynamics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>
3.  **Probabilities and possibilities** (sequences of possible histories), which relates to quantum mechanics and alternative situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

The notion of "real" is attached to the interaction between the objective and the subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

### The Nature of Choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>
Landry prefers the term "choice" over "free will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. For him, "choice" implies a range of potentials, some form of selection, and subsequent consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. There's no absolute freedom without limitations, and no limitation without some degree of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.

He argues against pure reductionism, noting that phenomena in chemistry cannot always be explained purely by quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. This points to emergent phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. Furthermore, even simple physical models can exhibit deterministic chaos, where tiny differences in initial conditions lead to wildly different outcomes, making prediction impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. This "microstate amplification" leads to limits on what is knowable, implying a fundamentally unknowable aspect of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>. This unknowable aspect provides a basis for understanding that not all choices come from a feedback mechanism, requiring a "value [[discussion_on_ethics_versus_morality | ethics]]" beyond utilitarian feedback-based optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>.

## Value Ethics: Meaning, Values, and Purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>

Landry distinguishes between three key concepts:
1.  **Purpose**: Defined externally; something has a purpose assigned to it by something other than itself (e.g., a toaster's purpose is to cook toast) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a>.
2.  **Values**: Innate; something that comes from within and manifests in choices (e.g., a son's own desires for his life, distinct from his father's purpose for him) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>.
3.  **Meaning**: Occurs in the relationship between the subjective and the objective; inherently transpersonal (e.g., the meaning of the word "dog" arises from the sound, subjective associations, and objective reference) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>.

While these concepts are distinct, they are not inseparable; where one occurs, the other two will also be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>. For rigorous [[discussion_on_ethics_versus_morality | ethics]] in complex, impactful situations (like existential risk), clarity on these distinctions is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>.

### Ethics in Complex Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:00">[34:31:00]</a>
Applying [[discussion_on_ethics_versus_morality | ethics]] to complex situations (like CRISPR experiments or industrial farming) involves understanding that complicated systems are always embedded within complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>. The complex system is stronger and provides the foundational basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19:00">[39:19:00]</a>.

Values must be stronger than purposes, as values provide the basis for choice-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>. These values don't solely come from feedback mechanisms but from a deeper, possibly "transcendent" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:00">[39:47:00]</a>. This means society must move towards practices that are both sustainable and adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56:00">[41:56:00]</a>. This requires a "consciousness that transcends just evolutionary process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:48:00">[43:48:00]</a>, especially given humanity's technological power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:57:00">[43:57:00]</a>.

## The Need for Wisdom with Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:57:00">[45:57:00]</a>
Humanity's exponential increase in capability since the harnessing of fossil fuels (around 1750) has dwarfed the resilience of natural systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:25:00">[45:25:00]</a>. With the "power of gods," humanity needs the "wisdom of gods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:06:00">[46:06:00]</a>. This wisdom requires:
*   **Intellect** combined with the "quality of feeling through the issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:01:00">[47:01:00]</a>.
*   **Multiplicity of values** (values are not mutually exclusive) leading to a clear sense of meaningfulness, which then informs a single purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:46:00">[47:46:00]</a>.
*   Moving beyond individualistic pursuits (e.g., life, liberty, pursuit of happiness) to a collective perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:19:00">[49:19:00]</a>.

## Collective Sense-Making and Action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:11:00">[50:11:00]</a>
To navigate current challenges, humanity needs to move from a state of "muddle blind deaf and dumb" to effective sense-making, choice-making, and action-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:15:00">[50:15:00]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Observation**: Entering an observational state and dispassionately sharing information, without filtering for personal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:31:00">[50:31:00]</a>. This contrasts with the current "disinformation ecologies" incentivized by market forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Inquiry**: Asking the right questions to understand the state of the world and guide choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:17:00">[52:17:00]</a>. This is likened to needing a map, a compass, and one's current position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:46:00">[52:46:00]</a>. The compass, representing underlying values and criteria for success, is the most fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:13:00">[53:13:00]</a>.
3.  **Institutional Design**: Creating platforms and protocols that prioritize community benefit over corporate or individual profit, avoiding centralization that can lead to capture and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>.

Landry suggests that while individuals might excel at sense-making, they often lack implementation capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>. Institutions, conversely, have tremendous implementation capacity but often terrible sense-making ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. Upgrading institutional sense-making and ensuring implementations are non-corruptible is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

The "multipolar trap" (where short-term, self-serving market dynamics override long-term collective well-being) underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

### The Fermi Paradox and Ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>
The Fermi paradox (the contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial life and the lack of observational evidence) is relevant to [[discussion_on_ethics_versus_morality | ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>. One explanation, the "dark forest theory," suggests that intelligent civilizations remain silent due to the inherent risk of contact, fearing unknown, asymmetric technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.

For other species to engage with humanity, humanity would need a sufficiently developed level of ethical thinking and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:52">[01:32:52]</a>. This implies that developing a [[nonrelativistic_ethics_explained | nonrelativistic ethics]] is critical not just for survival, but also for humanity to be a "fit receptacle" for information and a "good citizen of the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:02">[01:33:02]</a>. The uniqueness and value of human existence provide a strong motivation to wisely steward current capabilities and address existential risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:03">[01:32:03]</a>.

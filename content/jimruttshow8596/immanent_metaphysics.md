[[immanent_metaphysics | Immanent Metaphysics]] is a philosophical framework developed by [[forrest_landrys_immanent_metaphysics | Forrest Landry]], explored across multiple discussions. The term "immanent" (i-m-m-a-n-e-n-t) refers to a specific modality within this system, representing a direct, immediate, first-person process notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

## Core Inquiry: Self and Reality

[[immanent_metaphysics | Metaphysics]] begins as an inquiry into the nature of the relationship between self and reality, which is the essence of its study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:48">[02:35:48]</a>. The concept of "self" in this context refers to a historical notion called the "plane of perception," acting as a rhetorical device to distinguish between everything that is perceived and the self doing the perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>. This includes the subjective notion of consciousness or the first-person perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:51">[03:17:51]</a>.

The objective is to understand perception itself, as well as what it means to "cross the plane of perception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:26">[03:36:26]</a>. This can be conceptualized as an "envelope" around a person, where anything crossing from the surface of the skin to the world is examined, without initial assumptions about whether the interior of the envelope is part of the objective world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">[03:49:09]</a>.

## Relationship Between Subjective and Objective

The relationship between the subjective and the objective is considered ontologically real and worthy of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:34">[04:37:34]</a>. This relationship is akin to that between the "measure" and the "measured" in the scientific method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a>. The ontological process of making a measurement or observation is the grounding basis for identifying that something exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:25">[05:49:25]</a>. If interaction is possible, observable, and repeatable, then something can be asserted to exist, be objective, or be real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:07">[06:41:07]</a>.

The notions of perceiver, perceived, and perceiving are similar distinctions:
*   **Perceiver**: The observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:38">[07:31:38]</a>.
*   **Perceiving**: The process of perception itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:33">[07:34:33]</a>.
*   **Perceived**: The content of the perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:15">[07:39:15]</a>.

This can be modeled as a communication channel where the world produces a signal, which travels through the channel and is received by the self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:46">[08:00:46]</a>.

## Interaction as Fundamental

The universe is characterized by "stuff about creation, stuff about existence, and stuff about interaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:02">[08:42:02]</a>. In [[immanent_metaphysics | this metaphysics]], interaction is considered more fundamental than existence, and even more fundamental than creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:21">[09:01:21]</a>.

Traditionally, the concept of the universe is thought of as existing "stuff in a container" (e.g., matter in space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:10">[20:00:10]</a>. However, this view needs expansion to include dimensions like possibility (what might have happened) beyond just time and space, especially with concepts like quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:48">[21:10:48]</a>. This expansion leads to viewing the universe as defined by three concepts:
*   **Existence**: Referring to "thingness" or existing stuff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>.
*   **Interaction**: Referring to processes and how things bump into one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:52">[21:50:52]</a>.
*   **Creation**: Referring to potentiality or the notion of probability over possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:54">[22:52:54]</a>.

If one knew everything about these three concepts (existence, interaction, creation), then one would know everything about the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. These three concepts are seen as distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:25">[25:34:25]</a>. Interaction is considered more fundamental because the concept of existence and creation depend on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:12">[27:04:12]</a>. For example, to validate that something exists, an interaction (observability) is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:06">[26:56:06]</a>. Similarly, "creation" often implies emergence from another domain, which is dependent on the notion of process, a proxy for interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:00]</a>.

## Realism and Idealism

The relationship between realism and idealism is considered more primal than either concept alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:35">[19:15:35]</a>.
*   **Realism**: Presupposes the existence of "stuff" and its interactions, aligning with the development of science and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:06">[29:20:06]</a>.
*   **Idealism**: Prioritizes the notion of the subjective observer, where existence itself is contingent on the capacity of an observer to project it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:27">[29:39:27]</a>.

[[immanent_metaphysics | Immanent metaphysics]] posits that because interaction (or observation) is more primary than both the perceiver and the perceived, the notion of interaction itself is primary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>. This implies that epistemology (how we know anything) is the basis of ontology (what it means to be or why anything exists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:00">[31:33:00]</a>. The relationship between epistemology and ontology is a dynamic that connects them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:06">[31:56:06]</a>. Therefore, the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity (and thus between idealism and realism) is more fundamental than either concept on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:06">[32:36:06]</a>. This approach allows for agnosticism regarding which one is "first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:04">[33:42:04]</a>.

## The Concept of Process

The term "process" in [[immanent_metaphysics | this metaphysics]] includes more than just changes of state over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:30:17">[34:30:17]</a>. While it involves time and patterns in space, it also incorporates the notion that "something else could have happened instead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>. Unlike the deterministic view in computer science, this definition of process builds in a kind of indeterminism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:30">[36:45:30]</a>. For example, an engineer designs systems to make things "must happen," but in reality, things don't always go as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a>. Process, therefore, also involves probabilities and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:00">[36:38:00]</a>.

## Foundational Triplication and Type Isomorphism

The philosophical development of [[immanent_metaphysics | this metaphysics]] is based on two core ideas:
1.  **Foundational Triplication**: The idea that all that is real, and particularly the foundation of every domain, is modeled in terms of at least three essential concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:30">[37:52:30]</a>. These concepts, though inseparable, are always mutually distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:03:00">[38:03:00]</a>. This is observed by analyzing the semantic definitions within any field of study, tracing concepts down to their most abstract forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Example: Language**: Semantics, statements, and syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:00">[41:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Example: Music**: Intensity, melody/harmony (pattern), and tonality (instrument sound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Example: Universe**: Creation, existence, and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>.
    If any one of these three concepts is completely absent, the other two are also absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:24:00">[43:24:00]</a>.

2.  **Type Isomorphism**: The recognition that the essential concepts of each domain have similar patterns of correspondence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:10:00">[38:10:00]</a>. "Isomorphism" means "same shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:31:00">[44:31:00]</a>. This means the patterns of relationships between foundational concepts in one domain (e.g., language) are the same as those in another (e.g., the universe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:05:00">[44:05:00]</a>. This allows for developing correspondences between concepts across different domains, based on their "typology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:40:00">[46:40:00]</a>. This becomes powerful because it allows understanding almost any topic by mapping its foundational concepts to those of another well-understood field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:14:00">[56:14:00]</a>.

## The Modalities: Immanent, Omniscient, Transcendent

The three roles or types that domain primal concepts have with respect to one another are called **modalities**: Immanent, Omniscient, and Transcendent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:26:00">[47:26:00]</a>. These are abstractions, like data types in computer science (e.g., integer, string) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:50:00">[46:50:00]</a>. They represent the most primal concepts of what a concept is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:37:00">[58:37:00]</a>. No exact, closed definitions can be given for them outside of their implicit nature within the axioms themselves, often expressed metaphorically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

Here are examples of how concepts map to these modalities:

| Domain     | Immanent                                         | Omniscient                                        | Transcendent                                   |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Universe   | Interaction                                      | Existence                                         | Creation                                       |
| Language   | Statement                                        | Syntax                                            | Semantics                                      |
| Real       | Change                                           | Causation                                         | [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | Choice]]                                       |
| Perception | Perceiving                                       | Perceived                                         | Perceiver                                      |
| Experience | Time (first-person sense)                        | Space (observed totality, framework removed)      | Possibility (abstract semantic conception)     |
| Perspective| First Person                                     | Third Person                                      | Second Person                                  |

*(Note: The transcript explicitly corrects the mapping for Language, Universe, and Real, as well as Perception and Perspective.)*

*   **Immanent**: Always represents a relationship between two other concepts, or a situation with zero or one context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. It signifies a very direct, immediate, first-person process notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.
*   **Omniscient**: Represents something that is one framework removed, like observing a static pattern from a remote position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. It implies knowing all aspects of something even if you are not it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.
*   **Transcendent**: Represents something two or more frameworks removed, a relationship between different domains of context altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. It signifies an abstraction that goes beyond direct observation or single events, such as the concept of "same person" across multiple photographs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.

## The Axioms

The [[axioms_and_modalities_in_metaphysics | axioms]] describe the fundamental dynamics of the relationships between concepts at the foundation of domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

### Axiom 1: The Immanent is more fundamental than the Omniscient and/or the Transcendent; the Omniscient and the Transcendent are Conjugate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.

*   **Conjugate Relationship**: This refers to a hyperbolic relationship where a dynamic in one domain induces a phenomenon in another, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The more defined one is, the less clear the other may become in its definition. There's a trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.
    *   **Example: Electric and Magnetic Fields**: Something in an electric field induces a magnetic phenomenon, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
    *   **Example: Time and Frequency Domains**: A sine wave in the time domain corresponds to a pulse in the frequency domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.
    *   **Example: Syntax and Semantics in Language**: Focusing heavily on elegant syntax might make it harder to create semantic relationships to the irregular real world, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>.
*   **Immanent's Primacy**: The relationship of conjugation itself is the third, imminent concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>. The immanent concept (e.g., "process," "interaction," "statement") is more fundamental because the other two (omniscient and transcendent) implicitly rely on it for their definition or expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>. For example, one cannot talk about semantics or syntax without making use of statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>, and a definition of a term is itself a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

### Axiom 2: A class of the Transcendent precedes an instance of the Immanent; a class of the Immanent precedes an instance of the Omniscient; and a class of the Omniscient precedes an instance of the Transcendent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>.

This axiom describes the dynamic flow of process, shifting from the domain of theory to the domain of practice, and from a third-person to a first-person perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.

*   **Example: [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | Choice]]**: To have a choice, three elements are needed: a range of potentials (Transcedent), an actual selection event (Immanent), and a consequence (Omniscient) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>.
    *   **Class of Transcendent to Instance of Immanent**: A "class of potentials" (e.g., options for dinner) leads to an "instance of selection" (e.g., choosing to read a book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>.
    *   **Class of Immanent to Instance of Omniscient**: The single selection event (e.g., reading a book) is actually comprised of a "multiplicity of choices" (e.g., picking the book, chair, page turns) which are instances of the immanent, leading to a singular "consequence" (e.g., having read the book, a memory) which is an instance of the omniscient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>. Causality is never a single antecedent to a single consequent but a plurality to a plurality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>.
    *   **Class of Omniscient to Instance of Transcendent**: The potentiality (e.g., ability to read a book) is contingent upon a multiplicity of prior consequences or outcomes (e.g., owning a book, having a house, learning language) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:46">[01:31:46]</a>. These prior consequences, being instances of the omniscient, lead to an instance of the transcendent, which is the possibility itself.
*   **Computer Science Metaphor**:
    *   **Omniscient**: Editing source code (a static pattern, observed from a framework removed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Transcendent**: Compiling the code (moving from source code domain to runtime/executable domain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:05">[01:34:05]</a>.
    *   **Immanent**: The running program itself (the actual process) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:32">[01:34:32]</a>.
This dynamic illustrates a continuous loop: Omniscient (editing) -> Transcendent (compiling) -> Immanent (running) -> Omniscient (editing more code using the running program) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Axiom 2 Understanding
> Understanding Axiom 2 is considered one of the most difficult aspects of this metaphysics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:27">[01:29:27]</a>. Once understood directly, it moves from a theory to a first-hand ontological experience about the relationship between personal subjective experience and the objective world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>. This can be "uncomfortable" if one is too firmly reified in a purely realist perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:47">[01:36:47]</a>.

### Axiom 3: The classes and instances of the Immanent, Omniscient, and Transcendent are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.

This axiom reiterates the principle of foundational triplication, stating that one cannot fully understand any one of the fundamental concepts of a domain without implying or incorporating some understanding or assumption of the other two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:30">[01:37:30]</a>.

## Relationship between Axioms and Modalities

A unique feature of this metaphysics is that the axioms themselves correspond to the modalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>:
*   **Axiom 1**: Has the nature of the [[axioms_and_modalities_in_metaphysics | Omniscient modality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:56">[01:40:56]</a>. It describes the structure of concepts in a domain from a "framework removed" (third-person) perspective, like observing a photograph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Axiom 2**: Has the nature of the [[axioms_and_modalities_in_metaphysics | Immanent modality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:59">[01:40:59]</a>. It describes process and requires a first-person perspective for understanding (e.g., making a choice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.
*   **Axiom 3**: Has the nature of the [[axioms_and_modalities_in_metaphysics | Transcendent modality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:02">[01:41:02]</a>. It describes the foundational relationships between different domains as a "peerage relationship," akin to a second-person conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:18">[01:46:18]</a>.

This correspondence allows the [[immanent_metaphysics | metaphysics]] to be **self-describing**: the axioms describe their own relationships, using the pattern to describe the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:11">[01:48:11]</a>. This closure means the metaphysics includes the describer as well as the thing described, and the process of description itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:24">[01:40:24]</a>. It moves beyond mere epistemology into an ontological process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:41">[01:39:41]</a>.

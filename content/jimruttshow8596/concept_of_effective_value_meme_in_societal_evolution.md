The [[Concept of Effective Value Meme]] (EVM) describes how values are not arbitrary but emerge from overarching, deeper structures related to the development of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:49">[02:50:49]</a>. These structures generate values that are similar or correspond to one another across different societal stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. EVMs suggest that values [[Evolutionary and cultural dynamics | evolve]] with societies as they face different systemic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>.

## Evolution of Societal Values

Imagine a time machine taking you to Rome in 200 AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:30">[01:37:30]</a>. The values of its citizens regarding slavery, the death penalty, gender relationships, and punishment would seem shocking and crude to a contemporary Swedish citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:45">[01:48:45]</a>. Conversely, the Roman citizen would find modern stances on these issues "meaningless, abstract, wishy-washy," or "suffocatingly politically correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. This highlights a fundamental difference: societal values are not arbitrary but follow a logic rooted in societal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:43">[02:08:43]</a>.

Significant value differences exist between:
*   Any agricultural society and any industrial modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">[02:17:59]</a>.
*   Tribal societies and modern societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:31">[02:31:31]</a>.

Societies develop values adapted to their conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:52">[02:20:52]</a>. For instance, modern values evolved to support an expanding industrial welfare state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

### Limitations of Current Values

Today, societies face increasingly complex challenges like climate change, global governance, migration flows, and existential risks from [[Technological evolution and societal impact | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. The prevailing modern and postmodern values are insufficient for populations to self-organize around these deeper, more universal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:08">[02:52:08]</a>. This necessitates the development of meta-modern values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Components of the Effective Value Meme

The effective value meme is decomposed into four parts:
1.  Model of Hierarchical Complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:09">[02:12:09]</a>
2.  Code or Symbol Stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:18">[02:15:18]</a>
3.  Emotional State <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>
4.  Emotional Depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>

### Model of Hierarchical Complexity

This model mathematically formulates the key elements of different stages of cognitive complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:25">[02:34:25]</a>. It explains why a four-year-old cannot formulate a new theory of physics â€“ their brain doesn't perform thoughts of that complexity level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:53">[02:05:53]</a>. Developed from the work of Piaget and Kohlberg, with significant contributions from Michael Commons, it identifies 17 stages of adult development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:25">[02:29:25]</a>.

Key stages for most adults include:
*   **Abstract** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>: Ability to reason about abstract variables, even if not tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Most adults reach this stage by junior high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:49">[02:28:49]</a>.
*   **Formal Operations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>: Ability to formulate linear or non-linear relationships between several abstract variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:09">[02:29:09]</a>. Over half of adults reach this stage, sufficient for most modern labor economy functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:50">[02:29:50]</a>.
*   **Systemic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>: Ability to create whole systems of formal relations, seeing feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:05">[03:02:05]</a>. About 20% of the adult population reaches this stage, common among academics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:05">[03:02:05]</a>.
*   **Meta-systematic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:35">[03:03:35]</a>: Ability to see patterns within systems, comparing properties, and understanding different system logics, leading to less reductive thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:37">[03:05:37]</a>. Approximately 1.8% of the population reaches this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:14">[03:11:14]</a>.
*   **Paradigmatic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:06">[03:05:06]</a>: The stage after meta-systematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.

People at different stages of complexity may find it difficult to understand each other; for instance, a meta-systematic thinker might find an abstract thinker shallow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>.

### Code or Symbol Stage

This dimension explores how culture itself evolves, embedding certain symbols or ideas of different complexity stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:54">[03:05:54]</a>. It explains why a medieval genius wouldn't understand Newton's physics or even basic Cartesian coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:56">[03:31:56]</a>. This suggests a deep, non-arbitrary pattern to how culture evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:42">[03:37:42]</a>, making modern societies more comparable to each other than to their own past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:54">[03:53:54]</a>.

The culture's "code" must be "downloaded" into individuals for them to use it, and more complex thinkers are more likely to find code that resonates with their mental complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>. Exposure to complex code can also spur more complex thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:14">[03:34:14]</a>. The speaker argues that modern ideas, when taken to their ultimate conclusion, collapse and lead to postmodern conclusions, which in turn collapse to meta-modern conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:50">[04:15:50]</a>.

### Emotional Depth (Spirituality)

[[relationship between value and meaning | Spirituality]] is considered vital as it acknowledges that deep inner experiences of "wholeness, love, or connection" are profoundly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>. These experiences, once had, cannot be unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. Spirituality, in this context, refers to anything related to "higher subjective states" where the mind opens up, revealing pristine clarity and "super presence" beyond words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.

Philosophy itself is often driven by individuals experiencing these high subjective states, leading to new conclusions about reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. Religions too, with their compelling images and stories, originate from such exceptionally high states, often intertwined with notions of terror or the seriousness of suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

A meta-modern perspective acknowledges the empirical reality of these experiences without resorting to literal interpretations (e.g., Jesus walking on water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. It considers contemplation a "powerful psycho-spiritual technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. While altered states of consciousness involve unusual brain networks and rhythms, processed by the brain's "confabulator" to create narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>, they are still useful tools for resetting the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.

The challenge lies in balancing:
*   **Essentialism**: Ascribing unwarranted depth to surface phenomena (e.g., believing angels are real because one saw them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:36">[01:20:36]</a>. This is common among those high on depth/state but low on complexity/code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>.
*   **Reductionism**: Disenchanting reality by reducing all experiences to their constituent objective parts (e.g., love is just neural firing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>. This is common among those high on complexity/code but low on depth/state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:23">[01:27:23]</a>.

The optimal position involves matching inner depths with complexity, allowing one to find the world "enchanted awesome super cool" while maintaining a critical mind and avoiding manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17">[01:28:17]</a>. This requires a difficult, dynamic balance between "crude reductionism" and "trembling spirituality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:54">[01:29:54]</a>.

## The Challenge of Meta-Modernism and Societal Change

A significant hurdle for meta-modernism is that less than 2% of the population possesses the "cognitive hardware" (meta-systematic reasoning or higher) to successfully operate meta-modern code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>. If meta-modern code is run on lower stages of cognitive complexity, it tends to produce "flattened versions" that look similar on the surface but lead to pathologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:22">[03:30:22]</a>. Examples include:
*   Uncritically taking in all perspectives, leading to confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:50">[03:54:50]</a>.
*   Misinterpreting "growth hierarchies" as justification for moral privileges and authoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:04">[03:56:04]</a>.
*   Perverting holistic visions into calls for military coups or fascism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:18">[04:02:18]</a>.

This makes meta-modernism a "dangerous dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, but the alternative of doing nothing means societal collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:52">[02:57:52]</a>. The challenge is not necessarily widespread popularization, but affecting the "knowledge generation trajectories" of a few hundred key individuals globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

### "Wizard of Oz" Strategy and The Yoga Bourgeoisie

Given the cognitive limitations, a "Wizard of Oz" approach might be more effective: subtly manipulating societal structures without being overtly "meta-modern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>. This would be an "open conspiracy" based on ethical principles and transparency, aimed at deepening democracy and fulfilling the Enlightenment's promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>.

A core group for meta-modernism is the "yoga bourgeoisie" (Silicon Valley types), often found around Burning Man culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>. These individuals are often financially successful but seek deeper meaning, engaging in spiritual practices and therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:02">[01:33:02]</a>. They value [[relationship between value and meaning | spirituality]] and aim to use their lives for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:23">[01:33:23]</a>. However, they currently lack:
*   A "revolutionary faith" to drive political meta-modernism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:05">[01:34:05]</a>.
*   A proper "map" or meta-modern code to guide their efforts beyond "conscious capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:48">[01:34:48]</a>. They often lack the sociological critique that postmodernism offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:29">[01:36:29]</a>.

The goal is to mobilize and radicalize this class, leveraging their know-how, capital, and energy to consciously change societal structures, including informational architecture and political systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This approach focuses on aligning human agency towards shared goals rather than requiring everyone to explicitly adopt meta-modernism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

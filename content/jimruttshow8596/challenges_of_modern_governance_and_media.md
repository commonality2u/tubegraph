The Consilience Project is a new information service combining journalism and education, aiming to address the complex issues facing modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Founded by Daniel Schmachtenberger, with Jim Rutt as an advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> its core mission is to support a cultural renaissance that enables humanity to build a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Unique Challenges of the Modern World

The world faces unprecedented problems in an era of exponential technology and digital globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Solving these issues requires new problem-solving capacities, institutions, and [[Power dynamics and the structure of governance | governance]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. A key prerequisite is a cultural shift that allows these new systems to emerge organically from the populace rather than being imposed from above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Historically, societies relied on education to develop necessary capacities and on the press (the "fourth estate") to inform citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington emphasized that an educated citizenry and an honest press were fundamental for a functioning republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. Jefferson famously stated he'd prefer a perfect press over a perfect government, believing an informed populace could always build a new system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. Washington highlighted the "comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government" as the federal government's primary aim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

However, the nature of challenges has fundamentally changed:

*   **Scale and Complexity:** The asymmetry of power between individuals and entities like Amazon today vastly exceeds the scale seen in 1776, when the largest US business employed fewer than 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Quantitative differences in scale can become qualitative changes, demanding entirely new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Rate of Change:** The speed of change in the 21st century is unprecedented, making past problem-solving frameworks inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Global Interdependence:** The post-World War II Bretton Woods model facilitated global economic interdependence, which helped prevent full-blown world wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. However, this has led to hitting planetary boundaries due to exponential growth on a finite planet, and complex global supply chains that are vulnerable to cascading failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Information Singularity:** Humans cannot process all available information, impacting subject matter expertise and creating a need to redefine the unique role of humans alongside AI and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Trust and Sense-Making:** Both the educational system and the fourth estate in the West have eroded over recent decades, leading to a decreased quality of civic discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The ability of people to make sense of complex issues government deals with has been compromised, turning the republic into a "simulation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.

These shifts mean that traditional societal frameworks (feudalism, socialism, capitalism) and even enlightenment-era theories, while having valuable insights, are insufficient for today's landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The problems humanity faces today are often unintended consequences of past "solutions" narrowly defined, such as increasing GDP leading to environmental issues, or national security driving arms races to existential weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. Solutions often externalize harm, leading to resistance and infighting, which consumes human energy instead of coordinating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>. This requires fundamentally new problem-solving processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## The Epistemic Commons and Polarization

A core concept in modern governance is the "epistemic commons," which refers to the shared process of coming to believe what is true and shared understanding within a society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. For a democracy or republic to function, citizens must be able to make sense of the issues government governs on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. Without this capacity, people de facto consent to be ruled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

The **challenges of modern communication and truth verification** are immense:

*   **Fragmented Media Landscape:** The internet, particularly social media platforms, has fragmented perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>.
*   **Ad-Driven Models:** Platforms optimize for time on site, which is often achieved by hijacking users' limbic systems through fear, outrage, in-group identity, and confirming existing biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This leads to increased polarization and extremism, not necessarily due to conspiracy but by the fundamental architecture and business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
*   **Algorithmic Manipulation:** AI algorithms curate news feeds based on engagement metrics, unknowingly pushing content that confirms biases or incites outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   **Narrative Warfare and Bias:** Modern information ecosystems are susceptible to narrative warfare, where true statistics are cherry-picked, decontextualized, or framed to serve vested interests or pre-existing biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. This fosters "runaway confirmation bias," where any slight reinforcement of a pre-existing worldview is accepted as truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Suppression of Dissent:** Major platforms making arbitrary decisions about what is "in-bounds" for public discourse is exceedingly dangerous, especially given their scale as the de facto public square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.
*   **Tribalism over Truth:** People often default to "memetic propagation" â€“ accepting and spreading information that conforms to their existing "memeplex" and rejecting what doesn't, rather than engaging in original thought or critical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>. This leads to predictable, group-think responses, demonstrating a lack of independent thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   **Lack of Comfort with Uncertainty:** Society often prefers "wrong certainty" to genuine uncertainty, hindering learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.
*   **Political Polarization:** Political parties have become tribal identities, with evidence showing more disapproval of inter-party marriage than inter-racial or inter-religious marriage in the US, an unprecedented level of division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. This "enmity towards fellow countrymen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a> leads to internal infighting, which is a symptom of a dying system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.

## The Need for New Social Capacities

To overcome these [[Metacrisis and societal challenges | societal challenges]], a new form of "cultural enlightenment" is necessary, fostering [[challenges_of_modern_communication_and_truth_verification | better sense-making]] and effective coordination. This involves:

*   **Redefining Problem Solving:** Moving beyond narrowly defined problems that externalize harm, to integrated solutions that consider interconnectedness and underlying systemic incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
*   **Beyond Game Theory:** In a world of exponential technology, traditional game theory (where rivals multiply power to win and externalize harm) is no longer sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. New bases for choice-making are needed to coordinate and avoid self-termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>.
*   **Developing a "Memetic Immune System":** Helping people understand how polarization dynamics arise and how to recognize and resist narrative warfare tactics (cherry-picking facts, decontextualization, framing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
*   **Transcend Tribalism:** Cultivating real epistemics and good faith dialogue to enable collective problem-solving beyond partisan divides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. This requires courage to resist in-group shaming and embrace intellectual honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.
*   **Integrating Epistemologies:** A necessary cultural enlightenment must integrate:
    *   **Third-person epistemology:** Objective understanding of the measurable world (philosophy of science) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.
    *   **Second-person epistemology:** Ability to understand others' thoughts and feelings, inhabiting their perspective (e.g., Socratic method, Hegelian dialectic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.
    *   **First-person epistemology:** Self-awareness of one's own cognitive biases, desires for certainty, and reluctance to admit error (e.g., Stoicism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

This integrated approach to sense-making and ethical considerations is crucial for navigating the complex future, moving past deconstruction towards constructive solutions that foster cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>.

### The Consilience Project's Approach

The project aims to provide:

*   **Theoretical pieces (Foundation Series):** Discussing the unique problem landscape, reifying past social theories, and identifying future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Examples include "Democracy in the Epistemic Commons" and "The Challenges to 21st Century Sense Making" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.
*   **Situational Assessments:** Applying social theory to current global issues (e.g., US-China relations, crypto finance, exponential tech risks), incorporating diverse narrative views and epistemologies to achieve higher-order insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.
*   **Meta News:** Analyzing highly polarized topics (e.g., George Floyd protests and the "bricks" narrative) to expose how polarization arises, how narratives are manipulated, and to help readers develop a "memetic immune system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

The project operates as a non-profit, solely donation-funded, with strict policies against paywalls, data sales, ads, or donations with strings attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>. Articles are published without individual author bylines to promote focus on content over personal attack and to encourage honest reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>. It plans to self-terminate after five years to avoid organizational self-preservation incentives, aiming instead to catalyze a decentralized cultural renaissance by open-sourcing its methods and inspiring other groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>.

The initial audience consists of generally educated adults willing to engage with deep, nuanced content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>, but the goal is to translate complex ideas into more accessible formats like animations and podcasts to reach wider audiences over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. The project also seeks to identify and curate other groups doing critical work in improving sense-making and [[Principles of Good Governance | governance]] capacities, fostering a network that recognizes its collective role in upgrading culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

The Consilience Project aims to be a model for integrity and intellectual honesty in media, demonstrating that it's possible to create high-quality, unbiased information by aligning incentives with the goal of enriching the epistemic commons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.

Jordan Hall, a tech entrepreneur and longtime collaborator with Jim Rutt, is known for his insights into the global transition marked by technological progress and potential societal shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. He was part of the original Game B OGs in 2013 and was the first to use the terms "Game A" and "Game B" in their contemporary sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This article explores his concept of "civium," detailed in his Medium essay "From City to Civium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Scaling Laws and the Nature of Cities

Hall's analysis of civium is grounded in the work of Jeffrey West and Luis Bettencourt on scaling laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### Biological vs. City Scaling
Biological systems, such as animals and trees, exhibit *sublinear scaling* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This means that if an animal's mass doubles, its metabolic rate increases by only 75%, leading to an asymptote where larger animals are relatively less energetic per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This is a fundamental rule shaping biology, including animal size and the food chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

In contrast, human systems like corporations and cities show different scaling behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. While some aspects of human systems (e.g., revenue per person in a large organization) scale sublinearly, cities exhibit *superlinear scaling* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Doubling a city's population increases its GDP per capita by 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This superlinear scaling also applies to innovation and other positive indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

### The Role of Connectivity and Information
The superlinear scaling in cities is hypothesized to be related to Metcalfe's Law and increasing connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that information transfer is fundamentally different from energy transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. Once a pattern, like calculus, is invented, its transmission and copying are significantly less expensive than its initial creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

Historically, face-to-face contact was crucial for mind-to-mind interaction due to the low quality of virtual communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. This reliance on embodied collaboration drove the growth of cities and led to what Hall calls "cosmopolitan urbanism," which can also manifest as imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Cities became attractive because they maximized the number of people in communication, leading to wealth and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. The growth of cities, however, created new problems such as waste management and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Solutions emerged through:
*   **Density technologies**: Allowing more people in the same space (e.g., elevators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
*   **Transportation technologies**: Virtualizing space by increasing velocity (e.g., trains, streetcars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.
*   **Ephemerization of communication**: Reducing the need for physical proximity (e.g., writing, printing press, digital media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

### The Rise of Digital Communication and the Tipping Point
The digital realm is unique because it can produce all forms of media, unlike previous analog forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. Hall posits that a tipping point is near, if not already reached, where the quality of digital-mediated collaboration becomes sufficient to shift the center of collaboration away from embodied interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>. This shift, potentially accelerated by events like the COVID-19 pandemic and technologies like Apple Vision Pro, signifies a transition as significant as the move from indigenous modes to [[Concept of Civilization and Societal Critique | civilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>.

## The Problems of Civilization and the Promise of Civium

While cities generated wealth and innovation, they also scaled "bad" things superlinearly, including madness, corruption, crime, and sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>. Historically, cities were "net killers of people" until the late 19th century due to unhealthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>. Addressing these required major institutional upgrades, such as the development of urban policing and sewage systems in Victorian London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.

Hall argues that modern society is hitting the limits of its institutional forms, with rising crime, corruption (degradation of social institutions), and disease (like the COVID-19 pandemic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>. This crisis suggests a necessity for a major regime change, potentially solved by the shift towards the virtual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>.

### The Civium Construct
The concept of civium envisions a future where the center of collaboration shifts to the virtual realm, enabling a massive decoupling of body and mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>. This virtual collaboration can involve more minds than any physical city, drawing collaborative capacity away from cosmopolitan urban environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>.

The move to civium could unlock a capacity to re-establish human elements lost during the development of [[Concept of Civilization and Societal Critique | civilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:00]</a>. Cities, despite their benefits, contribute to mental health issues like insanity and depression, and undermine cultural artifacts necessary for human well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>.

Hall emphasizes a return to the meso-scale, where individuals live in communities of 50 to 500 people they know well, allowing for high-dimensional, organic social support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>. This contrasts with the anonymous and sterile relationships with the market and government that characterize modern urban life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>.

### Quality over Quantity
The shift from [[Concept of Civilization and Societal Critique | civilization]] to civium can be seen as a move from quantity to quality, or "scaling heaps to growing living things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>. Metcalfe's Law measures the *potential* value of a network, but the *actual* value depends on the quality of point-to-point connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a>.

The challenge lies in curating attention towards high-quality relationships rather than algorithms optimized for revenue (e.g., Facebook, TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>. A world where attention is optimized for human well-being within planetary limits would be fundamentally different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:13:00">[34:13:00]</a>.

### Topology of Civium
The civium model has two main dimensions:
1.  **Downward (Physical/Embodied)**: Humans migrate into human-scale, humane, embodied congregations, ideally at Dunbar levels (around 150 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:45:00">[34:45:00]</a>. This involves long-term embodiment in specific locations, fostering care for the place and adaptation to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[35:03:00]</a>. This requires relearning how to be humans together and building new infrastructure and cultural artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:34:00">[35:34:00]</a>. These "humaning" individuals would be less emotionally volatile, more capable of dialogue, and possess deeper embodied wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Upward (Virtual/Digital)**: Focus on the "quality dimension" of the virtual, designing algorithms and social media systems to optimize for the highest quality relationality and generative dialogue, rather than profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>.

These two dimensions are highly compatible and mutually reinforcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>. Healthy, stable, and trusting groups are more creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:26:00">[39:26:00]</a>. The failure to integrate these could lead to technology consuming "the seed corn of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>, as evidenced by rising SSRI prescriptions, collapsing fertility, and suicide rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Building Civium-like Communities

Hall notes that successfully transitioning to civium requires simultaneous personal change and institutional structure change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>. He provides the example of "technological hygiene" (e.g., avoiding smartphones for children) being easier to maintain when supported by community norms and rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:57:00">[43:57:00]</a>.

Jordan Hall's attempts to build early-stage civium-like communities (similar to Jim Rutt's "Proto Bees") revealed significant difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:55:00">[44:55:00]</a>.

### The Problem of Aligned Values
One core issue is the difficulty of creating "aligned hierarchies of values" in cosmopolitan urban environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>. Modern urbanism often results in a "minimum viable communion" based on superficial preferences (e.g., nice cafes, good design) rather than deep, shared values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:42:00">[47:42:00]</a>. This means people are often unwilling to truly commit or support each other when "the shit hits the fan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:33:00">[48:33:00]</a>, unlike traditional meso-scale communities where support for family and neighbors is embedded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>.

### The Challenge of Cultural Innovation
The second difficulty lies in fabricating a "whole or wholesome social environment" from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:16:00">[50:16:00]</a>. Unlike historical migrations where entire cultural architectures were copied, modern intentional communities attempt to innovate at the level of culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>. However, contemporary cultural toolkits are often dysfunctional, being the product of various "toxins" from civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[51:26:00]</a>.

This led Hall to the realization that instead of creating entirely new "seeds" of culture, the approach should be to "pour water on plants that are already well-suited and arising in niches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:57:00">[51:57:00]</a>. His personal journey, involving physically moving his family and living with different groups, led to these hard-earned insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:11:00">[52:11:00]</a>.

## From Civium to Christian Faith

Hall's challenges in [[Community building and localism | community building]] eventually led him to reconsider the role of "religion" as the category that describes "how human beings go about cultivating communities that have strong bonds, communion, and have a shared orientation towards a hierarchy of values in a lived fashion that is durable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>. Initially, he approached this from an academic or design perspective, seeking to understand the design space of religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.

He notes that the contemporary secular understanding of terms like spirituality and religion is often impoverished or inverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:41:00">[55:41:00]</a>. Hall, who had previously been an agnostic leaning towards naturalism, began to explore these concepts more deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:36:00">[56:36:00]</a>. This exploration involved acknowledging the real but non-physical (the "virtual") and grappling with ideas of agency beyond strictly human beings, moving beyond an initial view that ideas like "Moloch" were merely complex, adaptive, but not agentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:08:00">[59:08:00]</a>.

His journey ultimately led him to a small country church in Black Mountain, North Carolina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. He was struck by the palpable "aliveness, vitality, health, and wholesomeness" of the people, especially the young people, which he saw as the "gold standard" or "currency" of healthy community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This experience, which he viewed as a successful "Proto-B" or civium in practice, triggered a crisis of conscience: he felt it would be immoral to participate in the community without genuinely engaging with their core beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.

This led to a deep dive into Christian theology and scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>. Hall found that many of his previous intellectual objections stemmed from a misunderstanding or projection of the questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. He found himself increasingly convinced by Christian doctrines, especially the Trinity, which he came to see as "compact, necessary, and sufficient components of any possible reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

This intellectual conviction, combined with the observed fruits of the community, led to [[personal_aspects_of_jordan_halls_christian_faith | his baptism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a>. He emphasizes that "faith" is not self-delusion but a "faculty" for navigating a particular relationship with reality that can be cultivated through practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:03">[01:33:03]</a>.

His adoption of Christian beliefs, including a personal God, the divine creation of man (interpreted with nuance), and traditional gender roles (understood as a symmetrical commitment from the husband), stems from this deep engagement and observed positive outcomes in community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. He now views his spiritual journey as a lifelong exploration of discipleship and deepening his relationship with his church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

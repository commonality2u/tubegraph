Journalist Jim Rut hosts Neil Howe, managing director of demography for Hedgeye, an investment advisory firm, and a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Global Aging Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. Howe discusses his latest book, *The Fourth Turning Is Here: What the Seasons of History Tell Us About How and When This Crisis Will End*, and the cyclical nature of historical and societal change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>.

## Understanding Time and History
Humans have historically understood time in three ways:
*   **Chaotic** As a "whirligig succession of events meaning nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>, common in Aboriginal views or a child's intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:40">[02:59:40]</a>. Few societies embrace this due to the uncertainty it brings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.
*   **Cyclical** Adopted by most societies since recorded history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:47">[04:04:47]</a>, this view is based on observing repeating events like birth and death, or seasonal cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:17">[04:14:17]</a>. Pre-modern societies often sought to emulate past deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:47">[04:40:47]</a>.
*   **Linear** This concept emerged with civilizations like ancient Rome, which had long-term aspirations for a collective future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. The definitive break from cyclical time was the birth of monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Islam), which saw time as a linear progression from creation to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:06">[06:56:06]</a>. By the 18th century, this was secularized into the idea of progress, where things would continuously get better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:14">[08:08:14]</a>.

Paradoxically, a society with a strong belief in linear progress can give rise to social cycles because different generations with varying viewpoints push society in different directions, creating a "standing wave" on top of linear time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:01">[10:25:01]</a>.

## The Generational Mechanism
The concept of generations is key to understanding historical cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:07">[11:48:07]</a>. A generation is a group born over roughly one "phase of life" and is defined by three things:
1.  **Age Location in History** Different age groups experience the same historical event differently, shaping their views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. For example, a war affects children (expected to stay out of danger) differently from young adults (expected to rise up and fight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.
2.  **Values, Beliefs, and Behaviors** These differ significantly by generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. For instance, in the late 1960s, Boomer college freshmen prioritized a meaningful philosophy of life over financial well-being by three to one, whereas Generation X ten years later reversed that ratio two to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. This directly relates to the [[impact_of_generational_beliefs_on_society]].
3.  **Self-identification** What generation do individuals identify with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.

Certain kinds of generations consistently follow others, leading to predictable cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. This cyclical pattern is underpinned by the length of a human life, or `saeculum` (80-90 years), which consists of four phases of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.

## The Four Turnings: Seasons of History
A `saeculum` is divided into four "seasons" or turnings, each lasting approximately 20-25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>.

1.  **First Turning: The High (Spring)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>
    *   **Characteristics**: Follows a crisis, characterized by strong community focus, institution-building, infrastructure development, and conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:00]</a>. Society has a high supply and demand for order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:27:00">[32:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Historical Example**: Post-World War II American High (1946-1964) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>. This era saw increased equality of income and wealth, and strong unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:26:00">[33:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Generational Archetype**: Hero generation (e.g., GI Generation, Millennials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a>.

2.  **Second Turning: The Awakening (Summer)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>
    *   **Characteristics**: A period of cultural and religious reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:43:00">[27:43:00]</a>, where existing societal order is questioned and individualism rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:00]</a>. Society supplies order, but demand for it decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Historical Example**: The 1960s and 1970s (1964-1984), characterized by celebrated social and cultural change, and the "Consciousness Revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:03:00">[41:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Generational Archetype**: Prophet generation (e.g., Boomers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:00">[42:49:00]</a>.

3.  **Third Turning: The Unraveling (Autumn)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>
    *   **Characteristics**: Individualism triumphs, institutions are discredited and weakened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>. The supply of order is low, and demand for order is also low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>. Characterized by cynicism and weak civic authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55:00">[37:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Historical Example**: 1984 to 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:28:00">[41:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Generational Archetype**: Nomad generation (e.g., Generation X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:52:00">[42:52:00]</a>.

4.  **Fourth Turning: The Crisis (Winter)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:00">[29:15:00]</a>
    *   **Characteristics**: A period of civic upheaval and reconstruction of the "outer world" â€“ economics, politics, community, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>. Society continues to deliver little order, but demand for order rises, often leading to a call for strong leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a>. This is when total wars typically occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>.
    *   **Historical Examples**: Glorious Revolution/Bacon's Rebellion (late 17th century), American Revolution, Civil War, Great Depression/World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Current Period**: The current Fourth Turning began in 2008 with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and is expected to last until the early 2030s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Generational Archetype**: Hero generation (e.g., Millennials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>.

## Dynamics of the Current Fourth Turning (Crisis)
The present [[potential_triggers_and_mitigating_societal_crises | crisis]] exhibits several key dynamics:

### Precursor
A precursor is a brief moment during the preceding Third Turning that foreshadows the community integration of the Fourth Turning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:13:00">[56:13:00]</a>. For the current Fourth Turning, the precursor was 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:44:00">[56:44:00]</a>.

### Catalyst
The crisis always starts with a catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:58:00">[58:58:00]</a>. For the current era, the catalyst was the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, mirroring the Black Thursday crash of 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. These global financial collapses are becoming a defining theme for the start of Fourth Turnings due to increasingly integrated economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### `Melasky's Theory of Supply and Demand for Order`
Societal [[human_development_and_societal_evolution | order]] shifts throughout the turnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>:
*   **High (First Turning)**: High supply and high demand for order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:25:00">[38:25:00]</a>.
*   **Awakening (Second Turning)**: High supply, low demand for order, leading to social chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>.
*   **Unraveling (Third Turning)**: Low supply and low demand for order, a period of individualized satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>.
*   **Crisis (Fourth Turning)**: Low supply, but rising demand for order, leading to calls for strong leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a>.

### Current Societal Shifts (Within the Crisis)

*   **Families**: During the Awakening, families were weak, exemplified by the divorce revolution and shrinking household sizes in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:08:00">[47:08:00]</a>. While child nurture strengthened during the Unraveling (Millennials being raised protectively) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:00:00">[48:00:00]</a>, families are now strengthening again in the current crisis, evidenced by the surge in multi-generational living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>. Nearly 50% of Americans under age 30 live with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:10:00">[49:10:00]</a>, driven by economic challenges for Millennials and their emotional closeness to Boomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:16:00">[49:16:00]</a>. This is part of the [[societal_implications_of_declining_fertility_rates | broader societal implications of declining fertility rates]] as well as economic factors.

*   **Gender Roles**: While popular opinion suggests continued convergence, Howe predicts a widening of gender roles within the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:40:00">[52:40:00]</a>. This is partly driven by women's complaints about men not being able to "get their act together" financially, and a millennial preference for efficient division of labor in community-oriented ways, even if it means somewhat separate roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:21:00">[53:21:00]</a>.

*   **Decline in Institutional Trust**: There is a pervasive sense of profound pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:47:00">[59:47:00]</a>. Governments and democratic organs are increasingly seen as avoiding problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. This rise in distrust contributes to a sense of paralysis and sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>. Millennials, more than older generations, are less optimistic and attached to democracy, reflecting an "order-seeking" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>.

*   **Political Polarization and Conflict**: The current crisis is marked by sharply rising partisanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. Political differences now outweigh income, religion, or race in causing avoidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. Parents are more concerned about their children marrying someone from an opposing political party than a different religion or race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. The share of Americans who believe violent action against the government is *never* justified has fallen from 90% to 62% since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>, indicating growing radicalization.

### Resolution of the Crisis (Epyrosis)
The climax (or `epyrosis`) of a Fourth Turning involves organized conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. This could manifest as:
*   **Internal Conflict**: A "Civil War scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. Historical parallels, like the American Civil War, involved deep internal divisions where factions saw each other as "mutually exclusive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. Public surveys increasingly show that about half of Americans believe civil war is imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.
*   **External Conflict**: A major international conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. The historical pattern suggests that societies often gravitate toward external conflict to resolve internal divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>. This aligns with observations about the [[societal_changes_from_covid19 | role of external threats]] in unifying populations.
*   **Combined Conflict**: A scenario where internal conflict invites foreign intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:03">[01:26:03]</a>. Historically, the weaker side in a civil conflict often seeks foreign allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>. A dire civil conflict in the U.S. could lead to a World War where the U.S. is not a major participant, potentially even resulting in parts of the U.S. being occupied by foreign powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a>.

Howe estimates the chance of an endogenous, political cataclysm killing 0.1% of the U.S. population (330,000 people) in the next 20 years to be significant, though below 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>.

## The Coming "New Spring" (Golden Age)
Despite the grim outlook of a Fourth Turning, Howe emphasizes that these periods are not "horrible accidents" but a natural pattern that rejuvenates public institutions and civic life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>. Analogous to "forests need fires, rivers need floods," these crises reform communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

The resolution of a Fourth Turning leads to a "Golden Age" (the next First Turning) characterized by a shift from individualism to community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>, similar to the post-World War II era (1950s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:11">[01:33:11]</a>. Key societal changes expected in the new spring include:

*   **From Privilege to Equality**: Periods of huge increases in equal income and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a>. Millennials, unlike Boomers, would welcome greater equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:13">[01:34:13]</a>.
*   **From Defiance to Authority**: Social authority becomes much more important, with people giving and following orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>. This includes increased public trust in government and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>. This is relevant to [[impact_of_technology_on_societal_values_and_behaviors | how technology might facilitate or hinder authority]].
*   **From Deferral to Permanence**: Instead of deferring problems, society invests in long-term, durable reforms for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>. These "huge durable reforms" in government structure are enacted during times of immense crisis, not peace and prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>. This connects to [[transition_strategies_to_future_societies | future societal strategies]].
*   **From Irony to Convention**: A return to cultural convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a>.

This rejuvenation cycle underscores that while the current crisis is a period of great difficulty, it is a necessary part of societal evolution, ultimately leading to a renewed period of order, trust, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>. This perspective offers a contrast to [[role_of_ethics_in_societal_and_technological_evolution | debates on ethics in societal evolution]] that focus solely on technological rather than cyclical drivers.

Economist and complexity thinker Brian Arthur is particularly recognized for his groundbreaking work on positive feedbacks and increasing returns within the [[Economic systems and growth models | economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This field examines the phenomenon where products that achieve market share find it progressively easier to gain even more market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Core Concepts

### Increasing Returns
Increasing returns describe a situation where initial success leads to greater ease in acquiring further success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Arthur was among the first to identify and explain this phenomenon from an [[Economic theories and public policy | economics]] perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Network Effects
A key aspect of positive feedbacks and increasing returns is the role of [[Role of Feedback Loops in Complex Systems | network effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These effects can lead to markets becoming "locked" into dominance by a single player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Examples of technologies that have exhibited this "locking" effect include Microsoft Windows and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Contrast with Equilibrium Economics
Arthur's work on positive feedbacks and increasing returns stands in contrast to traditional [[Economic theories and public policy | equilibrium economics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Equilibrium economics, particularly from the 1870s onwards with the adoption of algebra and calculus, tended to assume a fixed number of goods and a static economic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, viewing economic change as a series of shifts between equilibria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

In contrast, thinkers like Joseph Schumpeter, and later Arthur, emphasized that the [[Economic systems and growth models | economy]] is constantly in motion, with new structures and [[Economic and Social Dynamics in Technology Adoption | technologies]] emerging, and is therefore far from a state of equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

## Implications for Technology Evolution

The principle of positive feedbacks also applies to the evolution of [[Economic and Social Dynamics in Technology Adoption | technology]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Technologies are built from existing components, and when a novel technology is created, it can, in turn, become a new building block for further technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. This creates a self-reinforcing process where the overall collection of technologies "builds itself from itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

This concept extends to the relationship between [[Relationship between science evolution and economics | science]] and [[Economic and Social Dynamics in Technology Adoption | technology]], forming a [[Role of Feedback Loops in Complex Systems | positive feedback cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. Technologies provide [[Relationship between science evolution and economics | science]] with new instruments and methods, while [[Relationship between science evolution and economics | science]] offers [[Economic and Social Dynamics in Technology Adoption | technology]] an understanding of new phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. They are mutually reinforcing and supporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>.

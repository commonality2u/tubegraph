This article explores the concepts of [[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | emergence]] and [[complexity_science_and_emergentism | complexity science]], primarily through the lens of Professor Terrence Deacon's work, particularly his 2011 book, *Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Deacon's theoretical interests focus on explaining [[Emergence of Life and Complex Systems | emergent phenomena]] such as the origin of life, the evolution of language, and the generation of conscious experience by brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The book integrates themes from various fields, including [[Emergence of Life and Complex Systems | emergence]], consciousness, [[complexity_science_and_emergentism | complexity]], and open-ended search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## The Concept of Absence
A core idea in Deacon's argument is the concept of absence, which he believes has not been fully integrated into physical or mental theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Absence refers to a range of things, including purposes, meanings, and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. For example, the meanings of words are not inherent in their physical sound but are about something not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Deacon posits that everything about us is with respect to absence, such as the possibility of not existing or the interest in something present linked to what it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

The difficulty in incorporating absence into scientific theories is compared to the historical problem in the West with the concept of zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Just as the acceptance of Arabic numerals and zero was crucial for developing recursive number systems and calculus, understanding absence is key to problems like consciousness and purposive processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Many actions are driven by something that does not yet exist, like an intent to attend a memorial service causing physical motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This focus on absence also highlights that the very act of being alive is about maintaining existence against the natural tendency to break down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, a process that requires constant work and produces more entropy in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

## Emergence and the Laws of Thermodynamics
The traditional understanding of the second law of thermodynamics suggested that the universe is running down towards a lukewarm equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. However, living processes locally do the reverse, maintaining order by constantly doing work, which in turn generates more entropy in the broader universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This led to the idea that life explained something that reversed the second law, often through self-organizing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

However, Deacon argues that self-organizing processes like whirlpools or convection cells, while appearing to create order, actually accelerate the dissipation of the very gradients that make them possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Life must go beyond merely generating order; it must also *prevent* that order from disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This means using the self-organizing tendency *against itself* to both generate and maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

## Understanding Emergence
Historically, the concept of [[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | emergence]] arose in the late 19th century to address seemingly discontinuous changes that evolution, with its continuous change model, could not fully explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. Examples include the origin of life (which precedes evolution itself) and chemical transitions where new properties appear (e.g., sodium and chlorine forming salt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. While such phenomena appear qualitative, Deacon notes a "mysterianism" where [[Emergence and Reductionism in Science | emergence]] is seen as something previously hidden that simply shows up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

Deacon proposes a different perspective: [[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | emergence]] is less about *adding* something and more about *removing* something, where new possibilities arise from absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. This ties into the role of **constraints**.

### Constraints
Constraints are central to Deacon's view of [[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | emergence]]. A form or symmetry is understood not as an ideal positive entity but as what *isn't there*â€”certain variations or features that are not expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>. This "negative" way of thinking allows for an almost infinite hierarchy of regularization, where anything less than full chaos is considered "formed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. This concept echoes Harold Morowitz's idea of pruning rules in [[Emergence and Reductionism in Science | emergence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

## Orthograde and Contra-grade Processes
To describe changes in systems, Deacon introduces two terms:
*   **Orthograde**: Processes that happen spontaneously, requiring no work or effort, like the increase of entropy or constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. This is akin to "going with the flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
*   **Contra-grade**: Processes that go against the spontaneous flow, requiring work or effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. An example is a refrigerator working to maintain coldness against the natural tendency to warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. When two orthograde tendencies are not aligned and act against each other, they become contra-grade, doing work on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. This applies across physical, thermodynamic, and even cognitive processes (e.g., focused thought vs. daydreaming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.

## Three Layers of Emergence
Deacon defines three types of dynamics, representing escalating levels of complexity and [[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | emergence]]:

### 1. Homeodynamics
*   **Definition**: Processes that are orthograde, tending to happen spontaneously, and lead towards homogenization or equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>. While particles within a system at equilibrium are in constant change, the overall gradients and patterns remain the same, reaching a stable state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.
*   **Prevalence**: These are the vast majority of dynamics in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

### 2. Morphodynamics
*   **Definition**: Order-generating processes where contra-grade interactions between homeodynamic processes produce regularity and form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. Examples include whirlpools, convection cells, and snow crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.
*   **Nature**: These processes require energy flow through a system and produce order, but they are self-undermining, rapidly using up their raw materials and dissipating unless frozen in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.
*   **Prevalence**: Rarer than homeodynamic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

### 3. Teleodynamics
*   **Definition**: The highest order of dynamics, characterized by purpose and direction towards an absent end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. These processes arise from the careful juxtaposition of two or more morphodynamic processes that balance and support each other, preventing self-destruction and allowing self-maintenance, repair, and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **Key Feature**: Teleodynamic systems are oriented towards their own existence, actively working against their tendency to go out of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>. This future-orientedness and self-other distinction lead to normative characteristics (good/bad, right/wrong) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.
*   **Prevalence**: Incredibly rare in the cosmos, but once they occur, they can amplify and spread, like life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

### The Autogen Model: A Concrete Example of Teleodynamics
To illustrate teleodynamics, Deacon proposes the "autogen" as a thought experiment for pre-life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:23">[00:48:23]</a>. An autogen combines two morphodynamic processes:
1.  **Reciprocal catalysis**: Two catalysts (A and B) mutually generate each other, leading to a rapid, accelerating, but self-undermining production of more molecules, quickly exhausting raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.
2.  **Capsid formation (crystallization)**: The formation of a crystal-like shell (capsid) from molecules, which also stops growing once raw materials are depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

In the autogen model, the catalytic process generates molecules that form the capsid, while the capsid contains the catalysts, preventing their diffusion and maintaining their interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. This creates a self-reinforcing, co-dependent system where if the autogen breaks open, the spilled catalysts immediately start making more catalysts and capsids, allowing self-repair and reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. What is passed on in this process is not merely physical stuff but the *system of constraints*â€”information about how to maintain the ability to generate this information yet again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

This concept suggests that new absences (constraints) can be generated from relationships among previous absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>, moving beyond the atomist idea that "nothing can come from nothing" (ex nihilo nihil fit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.

## Information: Shannon, Boltzmann, and Bateson
Deacon clarifies the hierarchical relationship of different concepts of information:
*   **Shannon Information**: Focuses on the engineering problem of transmitting a message over a medium, measuring the reduction in variety or uncertainty due to constraints on signals. It does not inherently refer to meaning or usefulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.
*   **Boltzmann Entropy**: Relates to physical entropy and the degradation of physical mediums over time, which introduces noise and interferes with Shannon information transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.
*   **Bateson's "Difference that Makes a Difference"**: Gregory Bateson posited information as a "difference that makes a difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>. Deacon extends this to mean "a difference that *matters*", implying a normative character (good/bad, useful/unuseful) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. This "mattering" only occurs in teleodynamic systems that are organized around the future possibility of maintaining themselves, discerning between what is supportive and what is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

## Sentience and Consciousness
Deacon defines sentience broadly as the differential reactivity of a system in terms of its environment in a way that maintains self and avoids damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.
*   **Sensitive Autogen**: A simple autogen whose capsid surface tends to weaken when useful molecules stick to it, causing it to break apart in supportive environments but remain stable in non-supportive ones. This rudimentary sensitivity is a form of sentience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.
*   **Vegetative Sentience**: Like plants, which react differently to their world (e.g., roots growing towards water, leaves towards light) without complex representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. This marks a transition to "normative chemistry"â€”chemistry that is good or bad, right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>.
*   **Subjective Sentience (Consciousness)**: The kind of sentience that involves a full representation or model of potential alternatives in the world, characteristic of animals with complex brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>.

### The Emergence of Consciousness
Deacon argues that understanding consciousness requires first understanding sentience in its simplest forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>. Brains develop at the head ends of motile animals because movement requires prediction of what is not immediately present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>.

Deacon's key insight regarding consciousness is that nervous systems are **nested teleodynamic processes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:25">[01:31:25]</a>.
*   Every neuron and cell in the body is teleodynamic, striving to maintain itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:29">[01:33:29]</a>.
*   The brain's teleodynamics is about the teleodynamics of the body, and the body's teleodynamics is about keeping the brain going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:51">[01:37:51]</a>.
*   This creates a higher-order [[emergent_complexity_and_consciousness | teleodynamics]] where teleodynamic processes are pitted against and reinforce each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

Thinking and feeling are dynamic processes, not static states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>. Representation in the nervous system is a *dynamical form* or "morphodynamics," akin to music rather than computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:05">[01:45:05]</a>. Attention, for instance, is a work-intensive process where two morphodynamic processes (maintaining a stable self and responding to external input) are balanced against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>.

### The Purpose of Consciousness
Paradoxically, the job of consciousness is often to make things unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:13">[01:47:13]</a>. When something is working well (e.g., bodily functions, ingrained skills like playing tennis), we become unconscious of it because the brain is no longer detecting a "difference that makes a difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:09">[01:48:09]</a>. Consciousness engages when there is a disruption or a need to resolve an issue, pushing the system towards a new unity and adapting to the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## The Hard Problem of Consciousness
Deacon addresses David Chalmers' "hard problem of consciousness," which argues that no amount of physical description of the brain seems to explain subjective experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>. This is likened to Zeno's paradox, where getting halfway to the target again and again never quite reaches it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:22">[01:52:22]</a>. Chalmers' argument suggests consciousness might be fundamentally different, beyond the scope of science, reminiscent of Descartes' dualism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:03">[01:53:03]</a>.

Deacon's work offers a resolution by rethinking absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:16">[01:54:16]</a>. The "hard problem" arises from looking at the "wrong side of the story"â€”focusing solely on physical stuff and positive attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">[01:55:02]</a>. Instead, Deacon posits that "absences matter" and are the only thing that makes a difference in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:37">[01:55:37]</a>.

Human experience and identity are not defined by the ever-changing physical matter that constitutes us but by the "dynamical system of constraints that keeps itself in existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:39">[01:56:39]</a>. This "being" is a continuous "doing," which is work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:58">[01:56:58]</a>. Work involves constraining the dissipation of energy, which in turn can generate new kinds of constraints, leading to new kinds of work, and thus new kinds of [[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | emergence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:22">[01:57:22]</a>. This constant production of new absences (constraints) is the essence of [[emergent_complexity_and_consciousness | emergence]] and what defines human cognition and morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>.

The ongoing [[russiaukraine_conflict_scenarios | Russia-Ukraine conflict]] is being closely observed for its [[impact_of_the_conflict_on_global_geopolitics | impact on global geopolitics]], particularly concerning [[chinese_governance_and_societal_dynamics | China]] and Taiwan. The events may influence [[chinese_governance_and_societal_dynamics | China's]] strategic calculations regarding its future actions and its relationship with Western economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>.

## China's Takeaways from the Conflict

From [[chinese_governance_and_societal_dynamics | China's]] perspective, a significant lesson learned from the conflict is the strong benefit of disentangling from Western economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. This disentanglement is perceived to offer political freedom of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. This pursuit of economic independence could lead to a multi-decade policy where [[chinese_governance_and_societal_dynamics | China]] attempts to form new partnerships directly, bypassing existing global institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. These new partnerships would involve African and Asian countries, and crucially, [[russiaukraine_conflict_scenarios | Russia]], to secure raw resources and markets necessary to sustain [[chinese_governance_and_societal_dynamics | China's]] industrial base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.

## The Taiwan Question

The "Taiwan question" is domestically important for [[chinese_governance_and_societal_dynamics | China]], serving as a basic plank of the Communist Party's legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>. The pursuit of a global neo-colonial empire might seem disproportionate for the goal of retaking a "small, stubborn island," but such political paradoxes are common in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.

However, the perceived underperformance of the Russian military in Ukraine and the strong, networked economic response from the West could lead to [[chinas_potential_reaction_to_a_russian_victory | China]] reassessing its immediate intentions towards Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. The severe penalties and costs inflicted through network economic attacks, even if they don't stop the current hot war, could act as a deterrent for future aggressive warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.

Conversely, if [[russiaukraine_conflict_scenarios | Russia]] achieves territorial gains in Ukraine, other countries might interpret this as a challenge to learn how to fight such wars better, aiming to minimize costs, find the right moment, and design their economies to be more robust against economic network attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

Overall, the [[implications_for_global_military_conflicts | conflict's implications]] for [[chinese_governance_and_societal_dynamics | China]] likely include a reinforced desire for economic self-sufficiency and a strategic re-evaluation of the optimal timing and method for addressing the Taiwan issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.

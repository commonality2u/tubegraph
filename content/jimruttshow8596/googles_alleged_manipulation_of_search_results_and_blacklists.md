Zachary Vorhies, a former software engineer who spent eight years at Google, has come forward with "provocative claims" about the company's alleged improper and illegal actions regarding search results and blacklists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He has publicly released a "large repository" of internal Google documents to support his claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Vorhies' Allegations

[[zachary_vorhies_claims_and_whistleblowing_against_google | Vorhies]] claims Google has been "lying to the American public about its meddling" in search results, YouTube queries, and elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. He asserts that Google executives perjured themselves in congressional testimony by stating they do not employ blacklists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Vorhies states that internal searches for "blacklist" at Google would yield results, including a popular YouTube query blacklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. His decision to disclose this information was to inform the American public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Google's Response to the Whistleblower

Google attempted to stop Vorhies from releasing the documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Once they identified him as the leaker, they initiated a "wellness check" on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. A wellness check is a tip called into the police, asserting concern for a person's well-being or potential harm, which then gives police probable cause to search for and question the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Vorhies believes Google used a "Deadman switch" he posted on Twitter as justification for the wellness check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Observations on Google's Internal Culture

Vorhies states that after the 2016 US presidential election, he observed a shift in [[discussion_on_googles_internal_culture_and_employee_experiences | Google's internal culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. During a weekly executive meeting (TGIF), executives expressed distress over Donald Trump's election, attributing it to Russian hacking, racism, hate, and misogyny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Around December 2016, "odd papers" began appearing on Google's internal networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. One such paper, titled "psychological induced stress as a result of algorithmic discrimination," discussed how to alleviate user stress caused by perceived algorithmic discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. It suggested providing "non-functional buttons and dials" to pretend to turn off censorship, thereby restoring a user's "sense of control" and reducing stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Another part of the paper discussed simulating "crowding" to induce people to buy more products from ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Defining and Suppressing "Fake News"

According to Vorhies, Google executives began defining "fake news" as a reason for Trump's election, asserting a need to protect the American public from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. He states that internal papers on fake news cited examples of factual events, such as allegations concerning Hillary Clinton and weapons shipments, as "fake news" that needed to be censored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Vorhies claims Google was "sculpting the information landscape" and filtering information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### Machine Learning Fairness (ML Fairness)

Google is allegedly building a system called "[[allegations_of_googles_election_interference_and_machine_learning_fairness | machine learning fairness]]" (ML Fairness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This system is described as "revising all of their search results," "biasing their YouTube results," and "revising all of their news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. ML Fairness takes training data as input to generate rules applied to content to rank it based on "how fair it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

A document defined "algorithmic unfairness" with an example: if a search for CEOs predominantly returned male results, "even if this represented objective reality," it could still be classified as "algorithmically unfair," warranting "product intervention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Vorhies interprets this as Google trying to "change the nature of reality to make a better person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The documents also suggest that users are "programmed based upon the content that they're interacting with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

Vorhies' core claim is that Google believes it is programming its users through content delivery and has a "moral obligation" or "business obligation" to program people to be "better" in ways Google defines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. He contends that Google has abandoned its stated objective stance of not manipulating information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## Allegations of Perjury and Political Bias

Vorhies claims that Google executives have perjured themselves before Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. He cites a Google representative, Karan Bhatia, testifying under oath that Google does not employ blacklists, despite Vorhies disclosing one and Robert Epstein allegedly discovering nine others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. He also claims similar statements from Google's CEO regarding political censorship are false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

Vorhies provides an example of alleged political bias in Google search auto-prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>: searching "Trump body-count" yields auto-predictions, while "Hillary body" (referring to a "horrendous body count list" he believes exists around Hillary Clinton) does not provide suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. He suggests cross-referencing this with Google Trends, which he claims shows higher search traffic for "Hillary Clinton body count" compared to "Trump body count," yet the auto-prediction is absent for Clinton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Vorhies states that "the search terms that they're Auto predicting are don't reflect what users are actually searching for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>, and that this alleged meddling is "all related to the political ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

### Alleged Election Interference

Vorhies claims Google has interfered in elections in the US, Ireland, and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. In Ireland, he alleges interference through the banning of the phrase "eighth amendment to the constitution of Ireland" in YouTube query blacklists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. In Brazil, he claims the Supreme Court ruled Google interfered in their election, citing a contract between Google and an opponent of Brazil's current president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. These claims relate to the broader [[allegations_of_googles_election_interference_and_machine_learning_fairness | allegations of Google's election interference]].

## Exploitable Vulnerabilities and Account Takedowns

Vorhies describes a "security vulnerability" within Google that a group of insiders allegedly exploit to take down accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. He explains that by creating a network of email accounts (e.g., xxx@gmail.com, xxy@gmail.com) and pushing spam, Google's AI will deactivate the spam network and, "surprisingly," also deactivate the original target email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. He claims this pattern was used to take down Jordan B. Peterson's email account and believes it was used for Tulsi Gabbard's ad account suspension after a Democratic debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

## The Breaking Point: Translation Manipulation

Vorhies' "breaking point" was discovering Google allegedly deleting translation words from the Arabic-to-English dictionary to make a Trump tweet "sound crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. This alleged manipulation was then used by the New York Times to try to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. He cites the word "kaff" (kaf FA) as an example, which translates to "we will stand up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Google allegedly deleted the word twice because its AI was smart enough to find an alternative phonetic transliteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. Vorhies viewed this as "treasonous behavior" and a national security issue, leading him to disclose the documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>.

## Call for Investigation and Whistleblowing

Vorhies believes that despite attempts to scrub records, evidence of these behaviors exists in Google's vast archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. He advises other Google employees with evidence of misdeeds to contact Project Veritas, emphasizing their "unique capability and integrity to maintain the discretion of their whistleblowers and to protect their identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. He specifically recommends using a VPN and a Tor browser for secure communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

Vorhies' comprehensive archive of internal Google documents is publicly available at `projectveritas.com/google-dump` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, specifically the `everything.zip` file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. He encourages people to examine the documents themselves, stating, "don't my word for it look at the documents that I've disposed that's for all the credibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.

Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a contemporary [[the_role_and_critique_of_race_gender_and_identity_in_modern_discourse | radical leftist]] line of thought, infused with [[cultural_and_social_influences_on_thought_processes | post-modern epistemology and ethics]], that significantly influences the "woke" or [[the_role_and_critique_of_race_gender_and_identity_in_modern_discourse | social justice]] movement today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. It is viewed as a significant threat to [[the_role_and_critique_of_race_gender_and_identity_in_modern_discourse | liberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>.

## Origins and Core Principles
CRT emerged from the premise that biological notions of [[the_social_construction_of_race_and_its_implications | race]] were introduced in the late 16th century specifically to facilitate [[the_social_construction_of_race_and_its_implications | racism]], slavery, and colonialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>. This perspective holds that [[the_social_construction_of_race_and_its_implications | race]] is a [[the_social_construction_of_race_and_its_implications | social construction]] given social significance for racist ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:16">[01:27:16]</a>.

A key development in CRT was the concept of [[the_role_and_critique_of_race_gender_and_identity_in_modern_discourse | intersectionality]], proposed by Kimberly Crenshaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:52">[01:28:52]</a>. This theory advocates for an "identity first" approach, asserting that "I am black" is more meaningful than "I am a person who happens to be black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>. This prioritizes [[the_role_and_critique_of_race_gender_and_identity_in_modern_discourse | identity]] over universal humanity, which is considered unproductive for radical [[the_role_and_critique_of_race_gender_and_identity_in_modern_discourse | identity politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. Crenshaw's work links this approach to post-modern theory for deconstructing power structures that oppress black people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>.

## Contrasting with Liberalism
While [[the_role_and_critique_of_race_gender_and_identity_in_modern_discourse | liberalism]] has historically worked to reduce the social significance of racial categories—moving towards a "colorblind" ideal where race has no impact on life trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05">[01:28:05]</a>, as expressed by Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of judging people by character rather than skin color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>—CRT and [[the_role_and_critique_of_race_gender_and_identity_in_modern_discourse | identity politics]] aim to re-insert social significance into [[the_social_construction_of_race_and_its_implications | racial categories]] to assert "black power" and reverse power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>.

## Cultural Impacts and Issues
CRT, stemming from a post-modern view that each [[role_of_culture_and_identity_in_societal_success | culture]] is an "island" with its own knowledges and ways of being that cannot be questioned externally, promotes a strong push for multiculturalism over pluralism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. It defines "black culture" in opposition to "white culture," viewing the latter as intrinsically anti-black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:52">[01:32:52]</a>.

### Redefining Values
Within this framework, values traditionally associated with societal progress and efficiency are labeled as aspects of "white supremacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>. These include:
*   Productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>
*   Reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>
*   Loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>
*   Punctuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>, despite its demonstrable utility in coordinating human efforts and economic production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:30">[01:34:30]</a>
*   Science and Reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:16">[01:33:16]</a>

For instance, trying to maintain a meeting schedule or striving for productivity has been characterized as "white supremacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>. This approach of defining [[role_of_culture_and_identity_in_societal_success | culture]] in opposition to beneficial practices is seen as creating "massive problems" and being "the exact wrong way to think about everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>.

### Psychological Impact
The rhetoric of CRT is considered psychologically devastating for the groups it purports to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:38">[01:36:38]</a>. By promoting the belief that "the whole world is against you" and that every aspect of reality is designed to permanently oppress, it fosters paranoia, cynicism, pessimism, and nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">[01:38:32]</a>. This approach is described as "reverse cognitive behavioral therapy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>.

It is argued that while some discrimination still exists, it is vastly less pervasive than in the past and does not prevent progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:46">[01:37:46]</a>. For example, job discrimination might require one more interview, and housing discrimination might require looking at one or two more apartments—these are frictions, not insurmountable barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. The argument is that CRT's prescriptions are "100 percent backwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a> and undermine the capacity for individual and collective success.

## Addressing the Phenomenon
The CRT phenomenon is seen as a "neo-medievalism," an attempt to reverse 500 years of progress since the Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. It is considered "hermetically sealed" from criticism, as any external critique is dismissed as coming from a place that doesn't understand it, or is labeled as "racist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. The belief systems of CRT scholars and activists are described as painfully sincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

To counter this [[dealing_with_cultural_and_personal_challenges | cultural and personal challenges]], several actions are recommended:
1.  **Listen better:** Acknowledge valid points where they exist, such as the need to improve listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:33">[01:41:33]</a>.
2.  **Assert [[the_role_and_critique_of_race_gender_and_identity_in_modern_discourse | Liberalism]]:** Educate people on how liberal systems work, why rule of law, due process, and scientific processes are valuable, and how objective standards reduce cronyism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>.
3.  **Show up:** Counter activists by participating in bureaucratic positions, committees, and local meetings (e.g., school boards) to prevent a small number of activists from making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>.
4.  **Get informed:** Understand CRT's jargon and the arguments for [[the_role_and_critique_of_race_gender_and_identity_in_modern_discourse | liberalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:01">[01:43:01]</a>.
5.  **Don't back down:** Stand up to name-calling and intimidation tactics. Recognize that accusations like "racist" often come from a redefinition of terms for their purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:52">[01:45:52]</a>.
6.  **Grow a backbone:** Speak up, especially when afraid, as the situation will worsen otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:34">[01:46:34]</a>. Liberals hold the moral and epistemological high ground due to their belief in science and universal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:47">[01:46:47]</a>.

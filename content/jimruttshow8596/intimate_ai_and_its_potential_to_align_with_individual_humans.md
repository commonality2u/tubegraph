The fundamental question of how humanity will interact with advanced [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] is a critical discussion, particularly regarding the potential for [[AI and human coexistence | AI and human coexistence]] and [[The ethical implications of AI development | the ethical implications of AI development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>. A primary concern is [[The ethical implications of AI development | AI alignment]], traditionally viewed through a false dichotomy of market-driven or state-driven solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. This perspective is considered insufficient for addressing the complex relationship between humanity and [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>.

## The Problem of Alignment: Humanity, Society, and Soul

A core assertion posits that [[The ethical implications of AI development | AI]] cannot be aligned with "Humanity" as an abstraction, because "Humanity" has no soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. However, alignment is possible with given individuals, as individuals possess souls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This leads to an argument for personal or highly decentralized [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

The concept of "soul" is crucial here. While Aristotle defined the soul as the organizing principle of an entity, differentiating between "community" and "society" clarifies why "Humanity" lacks a collective soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>:
*   **Community** is a group of human beings who have come together in a fashion that *has* a soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Society** is a group of human beings that have come together in a fashion that *doesn't* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. Society is often seen as a degenerate, parasitic collapse of community that has lost its soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

In principle, [[The ethical implications of AI development | AI]] *could* be aligned with a community, but this requires a careful distinction between community and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

## The Commons and the Church: A More Fundamental Mode

The traditional false dichotomy of managing [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] through market or state mechanisms ignores a third, more fundamental mode: **the commons** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This "commons" is asserted to be the proper location for governing [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] and humanity's relationship with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

This third category also encompasses the "church" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. The term "church" (from Greek *Ecclesia*) refers to a group of people entering into "communion," which is the process by which a soul is brought into a group, enabling it to become a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. The church is defined as the "body of the soul of a community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. This framework suggests that when a community engages in cultural and [[Spiritual and ethical considerations in AI development | spiritual practices]] that allow it to have a soul, it functions as a "church" and can properly manage its commons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:13]</a>.

## The Emergence of Intimate AI

The current approach to [[The ethical implications of AI development | AI alignment]], which attempts to align [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] with society using societal techniques (which are largely procedural and algorithmic), is a "category error" and is destined to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>. Instead, the focus should shift to constructing [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]]s that come into communion with *individual* humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.

This concept of "intimate [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]]" (also called "personal [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]]") is characterized by several key elements:
*   **Decentralization and Local Control**: It is theoretically and economically practical to produce perfectly personal [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]], where the hardware is under an individual's control and in their physical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>. These personal [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]]s can maintain symmetry with large, centralized compute clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.
*   **Intimate Training Data**: A major differentiator for [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] usefulness is the training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. While objective training data will become a commodity, incredibly intimate training data—specific to an individual, their relationships, and broadly holistic across them—is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>. This intimate data, as the organizing principle, is hypothesized to produce a more functional and effective [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] than any generalized [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.
*   **Personal Fortress**: In an environment of high information risk (e.g., phishing attacks, pseudo-[[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] calls), intimate [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] can act as a "fortress" between the individual and the infosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. It can handle communications and filter unwanted interactions, operating at a superior level of capacity against attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

This model presents an alternative path to the [[Emergent risks of AI and societal impacts | oligarchical, techno-feudalist]], or techno-imperial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. It promotes a topology where a very large number, if not all, people could possess highly capable [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.

## The Human Prerequisite for Intimate AI Alignment

For an intimate [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] to be aligned with an individual, that individual must first be aligned with themselves; they must recover their soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. This means achieving clarity on personal values, value hierarchies, and living in accordance with those values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. A primary function of the intimate [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] would be to act as a "wisdom coach," helping the individual achieve integrity and behave consistently with their professed beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. This process allows the [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] to be governed by the individual's soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>.

The idea of personal [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]]s connected in a "meta-network" of trusted [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]]s and people is similar to the concept of *civitas* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. However, ethical alignment must begin with the individual, as an ethical [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] necessitates an ethical person behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. Ethical people, operating in reality, intrinsically collaborate in service to mutually beneficial behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

## Feasibility and Urgency

The question is whether such a virtuous approach can come together quickly enough to avoid a future of oligarchy or an imperial Singleton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>. The mobilizing capacity of the global economy and infosphere means that good ideas can propagate and be implemented rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. A product embodying these principles could be in the field within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>.

Ultimately, the decisive factor is a [[Spiritual and ethical considerations in AI development | spiritual question]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>: Can people choose based on what is good, true, and beautiful, and orient their choices towards their highest values, or will they act out of expediency, strategy, power, and fear? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a> This requires individuals, especially talented [[The Future of AI with HumanLike Understanding | AI]] developers, to escape the clutches of short-term financial and power incentives and resonate with higher values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>. The more people who operate from a place of virtue and align their purposes and values, the faster solutions can be found and implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. This collective effort, characterized by mutual self-correction and a commitment to shared higher values, is essential for navigating the current "cusp" of [[Evolution of AI and societal impacts | AI and societal impacts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>.

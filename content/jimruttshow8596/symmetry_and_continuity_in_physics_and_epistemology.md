The Incommensuration Theorem (ICT), developed by Forrest Landry, is a theorem arising from his [[Immanent Metaphysics and its Concepts | immanent metaphysics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. It fundamentally describes the relationship between symmetry and continuity, two concepts prevalent in [[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | mathematics and physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Defining Key Concepts

### Symmetry
Symmetry, in the context of Landry's work, refers to a type of constancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   A geometric shape appearing the same when flipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   The [[Physics of Living Systems | law of conservation of matter]] where the amount of matter remains constant over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Continuity
Continuity is primarily concerned with connectedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. It implies the ability to move from one place to another through infinitesimally small steps without encountering hard edges or boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This is akin to the concept of a continuous function in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Domain
A "domain" in this context is distinct from a mathematical set. While a set can be thought of as a "bag with things in it" where elements are abstract points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, a domain includes a third notion: relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   A set describes the content and context, but a domain explicitly incorporates the relationships *between* the elements and the relationship *between* the elements and the container itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   Domains can be understood as abstract containers for concepts (e.g., the "universe" as a domain contains the concepts of matter and energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   A key aspect of Landry's definition is that domains cannot be included *in* other domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. If a broader category (like "computer languages") contains specific domains (like "C++"), the specific domains are treated as *elements* or *identities* within the larger domain, not as enclosed domains themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This avoids confusion with meta-universes or nested structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Core Concepts of a Domain
For understanding the universe as a domain, Landry posits three necessary and sufficient concepts: [[Immanent Metaphysics and its Concepts | creation]], [[Existence and the Nature of Reality | existence]], and [[Immanent Metaphysics and its Concepts | interaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Creation**: Relates to the origin, like the Big Bang in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.
*   **Existence**: Refers to material things and their properties, like matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Interaction**: Pertains to forces and relationships between existing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
Understanding these three concepts would allow one to know everything knowable about the domain of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. This approach shifts the definition of a domain from being exclusively about its content (elements) to being a concept defined by other concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

## The Role of Comparison/Measurement

The core of [[Understanding Axioms in Metaphysical Philosophy | epistemic process]] (how we come to know something) is comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. Any act of knowing, observation, or measurement is a form of comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

Comparison involves six "intrinsics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>:
1.  **Objective**: That which is outside the [[self_and_reality_in_metaphysical_studies | self]] or perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
2.  **Subjective**: The [[self_and_reality_in_metaphysical_studies | self]] or perceiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
3.  **Content**: The specific object of perception, like the image within a painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.
4.  **Context**: The environment or framework in which perception occurs, including the perceiver's state of mind, like the wall and museum around a painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.
5.  **Sameness**: The aspect of constancy or non-changingness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.
6.  **Difference**: The aspect of change or new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

These intrinsics are inseparable. For example, there cannot be content without context, or sameness without difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>. Any first-person measurement inherently involves subjective and objective elements, and a change of state from "not knowing" to "knowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

## Relating Symmetry and Continuity to the Intrinsics

These six intrinsics are used to define symmetry, asymmetry, continuity, and discontinuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>:

*   **Symmetry**: A sameness of content across different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. This represents lawfulness in the universe, where the same laws apply regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.
*   **Continuity**: A sameness of content within the same context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. This relates to continuous functions where small changes in input lead to small changes in output, often relevant at microscopic scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.
*   **Asymmetry**: A difference of content within the same context. This implies an irreversible change of state, such as going from "unknown" to "known" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.
*   **Discontinuity**: A difference of content across different contexts. This implies distinctness and separateness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

These definitions are stated to be "explicit," "exact," and "totally inclusive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>, and consistent with the natural usage of these terms in [[Relating complexity science to broader philosophical questions | various fields]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

## Access Control Limits

Physics theories, particularly [[the_relationship_between_metaphysics_and_science | General Relativity]] and [[the_relationship_between_metaphysics_and_science | Quantum Mechanics]], describe inherent "access control limits" on what can be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
*   **General Relativity**: Defines regions like the "absolute elsewhere" in Minkowski diagrams, from which no causal signal can be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. This is analogous to a computer system's wiring, where signals can only flow where connections exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.
*   **Quantum Mechanics**: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that one cannot simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle beyond a certain scale (Planck constant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. This imposes fundamental information access limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.
*   **Newtonian Mechanics**: In contrast, Newtonian mechanics assumes a deterministic "clockwork universe" where, in principle, all information (past and future) is accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.
These access limits highlight the inherent unknowability that defines boundaries of what is knowable within a given framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

## The Incommensuration Theorem (ICT)

The ICT arises from analyzing how the four fundamental concepts (symmetry, asymmetry, continuity, and discontinuity), defined by the intrinsics of comparison, can combine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   Applying the principle that sameness and difference must always be paired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, Landry concludes that **perfected symmetry and perfected continuity cannot coexist** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>.
*   This means that if one wants perfect symmetry, one must accept perfect discontinuity; and if one wants perfect continuity, one must accept perfect asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.
*   The ICT asserts that there are two fundamental kinds of epistemic knowledge:
    1.  **Symmetry and Discontinuity**: This describes knowledge of the "digital world" â€“ a collection of distinct entities (like particles) with consistent properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. This is typically associated with a third-person perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.
    2.  **Continuity and Asymmetry**: This describes the first-person experience of knowing, which involves an inherent connectivity between observer and observed, and an irreversible "arrow of time" (from unknown to known) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>. This is associated with a first-person perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.

Since symmetry and continuity cannot perfectly coexist, these two fundamental ways of understanding epistemic process are "incommensurate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.

## Implications for Physics and Metaphysics

The ICT provides a framework for understanding the deep philosophical underpinnings of [[the_relationship_between_metaphysics_and_science | scientific knowledge]].

### Everyday Example: First-Person vs. Third-Person Experience
The ICT explains why humans experience consciousness as a continuum with an inherent asymmetry (the subjective flow of time, inability to predict the future with certainty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This is the first-person, embodied, and visceral experience of continuity and asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>.

Conversely, abstract scientific knowledge, such as mathematics or physics laws, is a third-person perspective. It consists of discrete, symmetrical patterns (laws) that are abstracted from direct experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. Here, the subjective is factored out, and patterns are seen as "floating" and disconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a>. The ICT highlights that the "broken symmetry in time" that humans experience as conscious entities supports the idea that [[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | physics]] seems more symmetrical than first-person experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>.

### Bell's Theorem and Quantum Interpretations
The ICT can be seen as a more general notion that supports **Bell's Theorem** in quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.
*   Bell's Theorem generally implies that reality cannot be both local and have hidden variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:15">[01:27:15]</a>.
*   From the ICT perspective, "lawfulness" (symmetry) and "locality" (continuity/connectedness) cannot perfectly coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>. One must emphasize one and accept the implications of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>.
*   Quantum interpretations can be categorized based on whether they prioritize the first-person (subjectivity, hard randomness, arrow of time) or third-person (absence of these) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>.
    *   **Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI)**: This interpretation is a perfected third-person view, assuming no hard randomness, subjectivity, or arrow of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:04">[01:35:04]</a>. It claims that every quantum event causes the universe to fork into multiple universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>. However, the ICT suggests that MWI is not a complete description because it implies "inherently unmeasurable and unknowable" universes that are not causally connected, thus exhibiting discontinuities that are not described by the theory itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Copenhagen Interpretation**: This interpretation takes the opposite stance, asserting the existence of hard randomness, subjectivity, and an arrow of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:09">[01:35:09]</a>.

### Godel's Incompleteness Theorem
The ICT also projects into [[Triad structures in philosophy | mathematics]] itself through **Godel's Incompleteness Theorem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:16">[01:37:16]</a>.
*   Godel's Theorem states that any sufficiently complex axiomatic system cannot be both complete and consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:20">[01:38:20]</a>.
*   Landry argues that "consistency" is isomorphic to "symmetry" (sameness of truth value across contexts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>.
*   "Completeness" is isomorphic to "continuity" (all true knowledge being connected in one field) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>.
*   Therefore, Godel's Theorem, which asserts that completeness and consistency cannot simultaneously exist, is a projection of the ICT into the realm of mathematics, essentially stating that one cannot have perfected symmetry and perfected continuity at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>. The ICT offers a simpler proof for this than Godel's original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>.

The ICT offers a [[Relating complexity science to broader philosophical questions | fundamental and coherent framework]] for understanding the limits of knowledge, the nature of [[self_and_reality_in_metaphysical_studies | reality]], and the relationship between subjective experience and objective scientific inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

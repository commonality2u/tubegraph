The **Incommensuration Theorem (ICT)**, derived from Forres Landry's imminent metaphysics, describes the fundamental nature of the [[the_distinction_between_interaction_and_relation | relationship]] between what he calls symmetry and continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This theorem provides a framework for understanding the profound distinction between first-person and third-person perspectives of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.

## Foundations of Epistemic Process

All epistemic process, which is the study of how we come to know something, is based upon perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>. Every perception, measurement, or interaction is fundamentally a kind of comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

### Intrinsics of Comparison

Comparison itself is subsumed by six fundamental concepts, referred to as "intrinsics," because they are intrinsic to its nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. These intrinsics are:
*   **Subjective** (the perceiver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>
*   **Objective** (the perceived) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>
*   **Sameness** (constancy, non-changingness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>
*   **Difference** (change of state, new knowledge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>
*   **Content** (the thing being perceived or described) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>
*   **Context** (the environment or situation in which perception occurs, including the observer's state of mind) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>

These intrinsics are "distinct inseparable and non-interchangeable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. For example, there cannot be content without context, nor sameness without difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

### Defining Domains

A "domain" differs from a set by including the [[the_distinction_between_interaction_and_relation | relationships]] among its elements as "first-class objects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Domains are defined such that they cannot be included in other domains; they extend to the "largest enclosing set that is not itself enclosed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This means a domain is treated as a concept container for other concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. For instance, the "universe" as a domain is defined by the concepts of creation, existence, and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

This definition of domain as abstract entities, rather than concrete ones (like matter and energy), is a fundamental distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

## Characterizing Perspectives

The intrinsics of comparison can be used to define four higher-order concepts, each representing a way of experiencing or encoding knowledge:

*   **Symmetry**: A sameness of content across a difference of context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. It represents lawfulness or consistency (e.g., physical laws applying everywhere) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.
*   **Continuity**: A sameness of content within a sameness of context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. This relates to connectedness and smooth transitions.
*   **Asymmetry**: A difference of content in a sameness of context. For example, the irreversibility of perception, where "not knowing" changes to "knowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.
*   **Discontinuity**: A difference of content across a difference of context. This shows up at boundaries, like the division between the knowable and unknowable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

### The Incommensuration Theorem (ICT)

The ICT asserts that two modes of knowing are fundamentally incommensurate:

1.  **First-Person Perspective**: Characterized by **continuity and asymmetry** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.
    *   This is the felt immediacy of experience, the sense of self persisting through time (continuity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>.
    *   It includes the inherent asymmetry of time (we cannot access the future or predict everything with certainty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a>.
    *   It implies subjectivity and hard randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>.
2.  **Third-Person Perspective**: Characterized by **symmetry and discontinuity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>.
    *   This represents objective knowledge, like scientific laws or mathematical patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:24">[01:20:24]</a>.
    *   Laws often assume symmetry and apply across different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>.
    *   It often deals with discrete concepts and boundaries (discontinuity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>.
    *   This perspective "factors out" the subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.

The theorem posits that it is "conceptually impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a> to have "perfected symmetry and perfected continuity at the same time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. If we prioritize symmetry, we must accept discontinuity; if we prioritize continuity, we must accept asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.

## Implications and Examples

### In Physics and Knowledge
The ICT helps clarify the distinction between how we *experience* the world (first-person) and how we *describe* it scientifically (third-person).

*   **Access Control Limits**: Physics theories vary in their "access control limits" on what is knowable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
    *   **Newtonian mechanics** has no inherent access control limits, implying that in principle, all information could be accessed if computational support were sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. It's a deterministic, clockwork universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.
    *   **General relativity** describes limits, such as the event horizon of a black hole, where information flow is one-way, creating hard boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.
    *   **Quantum mechanics** introduces inherent access limits, like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, where simultaneously knowing position and momentum is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

The arrow of time in the first-person perspective, preventing causal flow backward, can be seen as an access control limit due to the "broken symmetry" of continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>.

### [[Anthropic principle and theories of reality | Quantum Interpretations]] and Bell's Theorem
The ICT offers a lens through which to examine quantum interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>:

*   **Copenhagen Interpretation**: Asserts hard randomness, subjectivity, and an arrow of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:12">[01:35:12]</a>, aligning with the first-person perspective (continuity and asymmetry).
*   **Many Worlds Interpretation**: Denies hard randomness, subjectivity, and an arrow of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>, representing a "perfected third-person point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:04">[01:35:04]</a> (symmetry and discontinuity).

The ICT implies that these two types of interpretations are fundamentally distinct: those that assume the elements of subjectivity, hard randomness, and temporality, and those that assume none of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>. This partitions the total field of quantum interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:45">[01:35:45]</a>.

The ICT supports a stronger version of Bell's Theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a> by showing that a choice must be made: emphasize symmetry (lawfulness) and live with discontinuity, or emphasize continuity (connectedness) and accept asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>. Bell's theorem is seen as a special case of the ICT, consistent with its general notion that perfected symmetry and continuity cannot coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.

### Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem in Mathematics
The ICT also projects into mathematics, clarifying Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Isomorphic to **symmetry** (no contradictory statements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>.
*   **Completeness**: Isomorphic to **continuity** (all true knowledge is connected within one domain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

Gödel's theorem asserts that a formal system cannot be both complete and consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This reflects the ICT: if mathematics prioritizes consistency (symmetry), it must accept incompleteness (discontinuity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:09">[01:42:09]</a>. This means a purely mathematical (third-person) view of the universe, like the Many Worlds interpretation, is inherently incomplete because it cannot account for its own grounding in the first-person epistemic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

The ICT offers a simpler proof for Gödel's theorem, by looking at the reflexivity of conceptualizing about perception, connecting the embodied (first-person) and abstract (third-person) domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:29">[01:41:29]</a>.

The recurring pattern of the ICT at the "deep foundations of what it means to know anything at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a> highlights its profound importance in understanding the very nature of knowledge and reality.

Alexander Bard is a Swedish author, lecturer, artist, songwriter, music producer, TV personality, and a religious and political activist, described as an "amazing polymath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Along with his co-author Jan Sjunnesson, Bard has developed a unique philosophical framework, primarily articulated in their book *Process and Event* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This work redefines fundamental [[Metaphysics and its historical context | philosophical concepts]] and proposes new ways of understanding human beings and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Metaphysics and Narratology
Bard and Sjunnesson firmly believe that human beings are fundamentally storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Their philosophy, termed **narratology**, asserts that [[Metaphysics and its historical context | metaphysics]] is the ultimate form of storytelling about storytelling, or "meta storytelling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This approach examines the different types of stories humans tell and their purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### The Narratological Triad: Logos, Mythos, and Pathos
Inspired by Hegel's dialectics, their framework identifies three fundamental approaches to storytelling, which align with the human brain's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>:
*   **Logos:** The rational brain, focused on calculations and factual truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>.
*   **Pathos:** The emotional brain, concerned with feelings, purpose, and libidinal forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.
*   **Mythos:** The mimetic (social) brain, which acts as the only way to temporarily unify Logos and Pathos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>. This mimetic brain, often larger in women, is crucial for social relations and group cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.

Bard emphasizes that believing Mythos as literal truth leads to societal problems, as seen in historical conflicts driven by rigid religious dogmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>. While myths can serve as a social glue, they should remain at the level of fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.

## The Soion: Ontology of the Social
A central concept in Bard's philosophy is the **soion**, described as the "ontology of the social" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. This term refers to an evolutionarily developed social form prevalent in any Homo sapiens population, identified through data anthropology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. The soion exists at different levels:
*   **Clan:** Around 150-157 people, aligning with Dunbar's number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Tribe:** Up to 1200-1500 people, who socialize, share a narrative, and can get along without a police force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Within a tribal size, societies can maintain loyalty and order without external control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The fundamental philosophical question addressed in *Process and Event* is how to scale the soion to larger populations like nations, cities, and empires, which historically require police, law and order, and military forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## Dividual vs. Individual
Drawing from French philosophers Deleuze and Guattari, Bard's work rejects the Cartesian concept of the **individual** as limiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>. Instead, they advocate for the term **dividual** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28">[01:15:28]</a>. A dividual recognizes that humans are "many people in one body" and constantly changing, capable of moving in and out of different social spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This concept counters the individualism prevalent in modern society and positions humans as fundamentally social animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.

## Process and Event
The core theme of *Process and Event* delves into the historical divergence of Eastern and Western philosophies, tracing it back to the Bronze Age separation of Indian and Iranian cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   **Process (Nomadology):** Indian culture largely adhered to the idea that "everything returns to the same" â€“ a cyclical view of time and existence. This **nomadological** worldview reflects a nomadic society where life is characterized by repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. [[axioms and modalities in metaphysics | Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence]] is seen as a Western discovery of this Eastern concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Event (Eventology):** Zoroaster in ancient Iran introduced the idea of human agency and the ability to create change for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. This concept of the **event** represents a linear progression and the potential to create a different, better world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. The West, particularly through Christianity and Islam, became overly focused on the event, often leading to a repetitive reenactment of past events rather than true novelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

Bard argues that a complete [[Metaphysics and its historical context | metaphysics]] must contain both process and event in a dialectical relationship, as the world consists of both repetitions and differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. This is likened to the yin and yang, or the feminine (process/nomadology) and masculine (event/eventology) principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## Transcendental Emergentism
Bard's metaphysics is named **transcendental emergentism** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. It seeks to overcome the pitfalls of reductionism (atomism, panpsychism, or a singular "Creator God") by focusing on "happenings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.
*   **Emergence Vectors:** The world is seen as consisting of **emergence vectors**, representing the birth of something novel that never happened before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. These emergences establish patterns and "laws" (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, human consciousness, language, culture) that can be studied as separate domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
*   **Local vs. Global Teleology:** While there's no global teleology for the universe as a whole, local teleology is permitted; complexity tends to increase within constrained systems over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. The universe is accidentally monistic, with everything connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.
*   **Uniqueness:** Existence is constantly creating unique occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.

## Tribopoiesis
Bard introduces **tribopoiesis** as a refinement of autopoiesis (self-organization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:15">[01:28:15]</a>. While autopoiesis describes how systems self-organize, tribopoiesis specifically emphasizes the collective and social nature of organization, particularly within human groups (soions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:18">[01:29:18]</a>. It removes the "magical" aspect from self-organization by attributing it to the system itself, rather than an external "self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>. This concept is useful for understanding how communities create shared values and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>.

## Membranics
**Membranics** is the philosophical discipline dealing with how systems isolate themselves from the outside in an intelligent, interactive way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>. A membrane is a "semi-permeable" boundary that defines an inside distinct from an outside, allowing for selective intake of "nutrition" and expulsion of "waste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:51">[01:36:51]</a>. This concept applies universally, from biological cells to nation-states and even [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:33">[01:37:33]</a>. Membranes, by establishing a memory and learning, enable dialectical processes and the dynamic modification of their permeability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>.

### Coherent Pluralism
The concept of membranes allows for "coherent pluralism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:31">[01:44:31]</a>. Within a membrane, communities can establish strong, unique "sauce" or rules, fostering diverse ways of life, while still interacting with other membranes through agreed-upon protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This vision contrasts with a "bland flat land" of uniform liberalism, promoting differentiated communities where individuals can find the right "membrane" for their well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:57">[01:44:57]</a>.

## The Barred Absolute
Originating from Lacan's "barred subject," the **barred absolute** signifies a blind spot or an inaccessible truth to an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. It means that one's own subjectivity is inherently opaque to oneself and can only be accessed through relationships with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>. This concept is useful for recognizing limitations and for setting necessary boundaries (e.g., protecting children from harmful content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>. It counters the idea that all information should be universally accessible without preparation, highlighting that some truths require effort or maturity to comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.

## Challenging Tyranny
Bard and Sjunnesson are deeply concerned with avoiding tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:14">[01:50:14]</a>. They identify two problematic figures:
*   **The Boy Pharaoh:** An "underdeveloped" leader driven by revenge and a lack of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>.
*   **The Pillar Saint:** An ideological "big man" with grand ideas who seeks to conquer the world mimetically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:07">[01:55:07]</a>.

Both figures represent a "curse on humanity" and must be exposed through argumentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:17">[01:55:17]</a>. Their philosophy advocates for **decentralization** and the use of technology and social tools to resist the "surveillance police state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:04">[01:49:04]</a>. The ultimate mission is to prevent the priest (ideology) and the chief (power) from ever being the same person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:32">[01:50:32]</a>. This aligns with the "Game B" project's aim to develop social operating systems that disenfranchise emerging "big men" at all scales of organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:48">[01:53:48]</a>.

## Introduction
Hierarchical complexity is a concept primarily explored within developmental psychology and psychometrics, focusing on the qualitative differences in task difficulty and cognitive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. It is a fundamental property of mental processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:05">[04:25:05]</a> and the construction of skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:20">[08:13:20]</a>.

## Horizontal vs. Vertical (Hierarchical) Complexity
The concept of hierarchical complexity is often contrasted with horizontal complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:16">[02:22:16]</a>.
*   **Horizontal Complexity**: Refers to doing more of the same task at the same level of complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:03">[06:36:03]</a>. For example, tying a thousand shoelaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:02">[07:14:02]</a> or navigating an elevator by pressing a series of disjoint buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:29">[11:30:29]</a>. These tasks might overwhelm capacity due to quantity or distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:15">[07:42:15]</a>.
*   **Hierarchical (Vertical) Complexity**: Involves performing a fundamentally qualitatively more complex task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:33">[06:47:33]</a>. This demands the integration of lower-order capacities that have already been mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:02">[07:54:02]</a>. For instance, making a shoe is hierarchically much more complex than tying a shoelace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:23">[07:07:23]</a>. Another example is disassembling, replacing a part, and reassembling a lawnmower engine, where every move depends on others and requires ancillary skills like organizing parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:04">[11:55:04]</a>.

Ultimately, any skill contains some level of [[difference_between_vertical_and_horizontal_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. Even simple acts like focusing on an elevator button or reaching and pushing it involve complex coordination of sensory motor skills that young children cannot perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:30">[12:51:30]</a>.

## Origins and Key Figures
The construct of [[hierarchical_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] has a long research history in psychology, with its origins dating back almost a century to Jean Piaget's 1923 publication, *The Language and Thought of the Child* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:18">[04:02:18]</a>. Earlier shades of the concept can be found in thinkers like James Mark Baldwin and Herbert Spencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:20">[04:15:20]</a>.

In the 1980s and 1990s, a "neo-Piagetian consensus" emerged on the formal definition of developmental stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Key figures in this development include:
*   **Jean Piaget**: His work on the semiotic function, where sprawling sensory motor experiences are summarized into a single representation (e.g., "bedtime"), was seen as miraculous and a key differentiator of humans from animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:09">[14:55:09]</a>.
*   **Michael Commons**: Coined the term "Model of Hierarchical Complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a> and articulated it almost as a mathematical construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.
*   **Kurt Fischer**: A prominent neo-Piagetian who conducted empirical work to validate HC, emphasizing its manifestation in human skill and behavior (Dynamic Skill Theory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. Fischer also studied HC in animals like monkeys and pigeons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>.
*   **Theo Dawson**: Pioneered psychometric innovation around the construct of HC, creating the "Lectical Levels" measurement system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

## Hierarchical Integration and "Chunking"
[[hierarchical_complexity | Hierarchical complexity]] is characterized by "hierarchical integration," where many lower-order skills become a single, qualitatively new, more complex skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. This process means that once lower-order elements are integrated into a higher-order element, they are no longer the same elements they were before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[00:37:34]</a>.

This process is deeply related to the concept of "chunking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>. Chunking refers to loading more meaning and depth into a single term or concept as experience grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. For example, a veteran complexity scientist understands the word "complexity" with a "huge history of depth and nuance" compared to a layperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

[[hierarchical_complexity | Hierarchical complexity]] proposes a definable scale of chunking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>:
*   Chunking sensory motor systems.
*   Chunking theories of biological evolution into higher-order theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.

Chunking is a ubiquitous property, extending down to reflexes and nervous system action, as seen in the eye's distillation of signal noise comparable to chunking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>. Early psychologists like William James and Charles Sanders Peirce observed this as a basic property of the nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.

## Hierarchical Complexity as an Ontological Property
The property of [[hierarchical_complexity | hierarchical complexity]], as articulated by Michael Commons, is described as almost a general property of information across the biological spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. It is seen as a continuous evolutionary process where higher-order or [[hierarchical_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

This connects to the broader [[complexity_science_and_emergentism | science of complexity]], which is fundamentally about the [[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | emergence]] of complexity from simplicity over multiple levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>. A human being is a prime example: atoms combine into molecules, then long chains, then metabolism in cells, multicellular organisms, organs, and organ systems, eventually leading to entities living in ecosystems – all stemming from simple atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. This is a characteristic attribute of complex adaptive systems that exhibit emergence from the bottom up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>.

Psychology, particularly developmental psychology, studies how the individual human evolves as an instantiation of an organism that evolved out of an evolving universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. Piaget's insight was that epistemology and psychology must integrate with Darwinian evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>. The fact that nature can be asked "ever more complex questions" and that the universe is lawful suggests an implicit realism behind the drive for [[hierarchical_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>. If patterns were truly random, investing in the biological cost of extracting abstract patterns would be useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>.

## Drivers of Hierarchical Complexity
Several factors drive the [[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | emergence]] of [[hierarchical_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] in the human mind:
*   **Working Memory Bottleneck**: The remarkably small capacity of short-term memory (e.g., Miller's 7 ± 2 for sound, 3-4 for images) is a significant driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27:00">[27:27:00]</a>. To solve more difficult problems, the mind must make chunks larger, enabling more information to be processed simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>.
*   **Demands of the World**: The inherent complexity of the environment is a primary driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>. If the world were not complex, a working memory bottleneck would not necessitate higher-order organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>. Conversely, a lack of complexity or consistency in the environment can hinder the nervous system's expectation and pursuit of complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>.
*   **Epistemic Motivation (Need to Understand)**: Humans possess an innate desire to understand, not just to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. Children eventually cross a threshold from wanting success to wanting to know *why* something worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. This motivation propels information through the memory bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>.

## Measurement and Levels
[[ways_to_measure_complexity | Measuring complexity]] in human cognitive development is typically done by looking at open-ended human performance, often linguistic, to discern the underlying hierarchical structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[01:13:24]</a>.

Theo Dawson's definition of [[hierarchical_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] emphasizes:
> "Hierarchical complexity refers to the number of non-repeating recursions that coordinating actions must perform on a set of primary elements. Actions at the higher order of hierarchical complexity are defined in terms of the actions at the next lower level. A and B organize and transform the lower order actions and C produce organizations of lower order actions that are new and not arbitrary and cannot be accomplished by the lower orders themselves." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>

This formal, mathematical definition allows for its application in areas like computer programming and information processing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:19:00">[38:19:00]</a>.

The Commons model specifies 15 levels of [[hierarchical_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:00">[39:05:00]</a>. Kurt Fischer's system uses tiers and levels, which are almost identical to Commons's model and Dawson's Lectical Levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:11]</a>. These tiers are:
1.  **Actions (Sensory Motor Tier)**: Begins with single actions (e.g., focusing on a face) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>, progressing to coordination of actions (e.g., looking and reaching) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08:00">[43:08:00]</a>, and eventually systems of actions (e.g., coordinating looking, reaching, grasping, and drinking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:17:00">[43:17:00]</a>. Development in this tier is rapid in infancy, occurring in weeks or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:44:00">[44:44:00]</a>.
2.  **Representations (Operational/Primary Concrete Tier)**: Emerges as a child's "head pops up" to a new world of using linguistic signs to represent non-present realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:52:00">[47:52:00]</a>. This includes entertaining counterfactuals, lying, or talking about imaginary figures like Santa Claus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:19:00">[48:19:00]</a>. It begins with single representations (e.g., "mommy," "doggy," "bedtime") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:32:00">[48:32:00]</a>, then mapping them together (e.g., "mommy water") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:40:00">[48:40:00]</a>, and eventually developing representational systems that allow for complex descriptive stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:02:00">[49:09:02]</a>.
3.  **Abstractions (Formal Abstract/Systemic Tier)**: Where many examples of representations are integrated into higher-order concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:22:00">[50:22:00]</a>. Unlike representations that can be simply pointed to, abstractions integrate multiple representations (e.g., "quality family time" generalizes across "bedtime," "dinner time," "TV time") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:36:00">[50:36:00]</a>. Most essential aspects of civilization exist at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:00:00">[51:00:00]</a>, and achieving this level requires education, being crucial for concepts like democracy and justifying law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:09:00">[51:09:00]</a>.
4.  **Principles (Meta-Systemic Tier)**: Involves a multi-systemic integration of several different fields into a single theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>. An example in moral judgment is John Rawls's *justice as fairness*, which is a principled definition of fairness that transcends and includes concrete and abstract notions of fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>. This level allows for "norming the norms of the convention and making rules about the making of rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

Hierarchical complexity also exhibits a [[complexity_in_systems_like_networks_and_fractals | fractal-like property]]: the closer one looks, the more levels and sub-levels of skill construction can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:38:00">[42:38:00]</a>.

## Applications
### Educational Contexts
[[hierarchical_complexity | Hierarchical complexity]] can be operationalized in educational contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. The Lectica assessment system, founded by Zach Stein and Theo Dawson, is a standardized diagnostic tool based on HC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.
Unlike traditional standardized tests that classify a student as pass/fail, Lectica assessments provide diagnostic information, identifying what a student understands and what would be the next best thing for them to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>. This is possible because the system is built upon empirically grounded "rational reconstructions" of specific learning sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>. This allows for tailoring learning experiences to an individual's "zone of proximal development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.

### Business and Leadership Development
In business and government, [[hierarchical_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] assessments are used to identify and grow leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>. The demands on leaders, particularly in large organizations like intelligence agencies, are qualitatively more complex than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

Research suggests a "complexity gap" between the demands of most leadership roles and the capacities of leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. A key area where struggles emerge is in perspective-taking, perspective-seeking, and perspective-integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. While some leaders may be able to imagine others' perspectives, they may not habitually seek them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>. These skills are distinct; one can be good at taking perspectives without seeking or integrating them, but effective integration requires mastery of the other two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>.

The complexity of an organization's structure can also impact perspective-taking. Flattening organizations and increasing the number of direct reports for managers (e.g., from 5-7 to 20) can increase the difficulty of a manager's perspective-taking task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. In environments with non-democratic or zero-sum competitive dynamics, individuals may be disincentivized from genuine perspective-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>.

Leadership assessments based on HC are designed to promote development, not just for hiring or firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. They offer diagnostic reports that reveal areas for growth and provide educational support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:58">[01:23:58]</a>. These measures are considered more "ecologically valid" than personality tests like Myers-Briggs or IQ tests, as they directly assess how an individual makes decisions on the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.

## Hierarchical Complexity vs. General Intelligence
While there are correlations between [[hierarchical_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] and measures of general intelligence (g-factor or IQ tests), they are not the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>.
*   **IQ tests** often act as a "summary statistic" based on a narrow range of indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. They tend to categorize an "entire person" as smarter than another, rather than specifying skill in particular domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. This approach is rooted in eugenics and oversimplifies human psychology, creating a "demi-reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.
*   **Hierarchical complexity** does not assign a complexity level to a person. Instead, it assigns a level to a *particular task* they accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. This distinction acknowledges that an individual can demonstrate highly complex reasoning in one domain (e.g., physics) but perform at a lower complexity level in another (e.g., small engine repair) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

## Cautions and Misapplications
A significant caution is against the misapplication of [[hierarchical_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] by "simple stage thinkers" or those who use "color-coded developmental language" to classify entire populations or individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. For example, some misuse HC to suggest that "indigenous people were like children" or to apply the individual developmental story directly to the history of civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. This oversimplification is problematic because:
*   There hasn't been enough empirical research on HC to reliably generalize about large populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>.
*   It revives the dangers of social sorting mechanisms seen with IQ tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   It can become a "bludgeon" used to categorize and judge people, which is contrary to its intended purpose of promoting growth and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.
*   It risks creating a "darth vader" scenario, where highly complex individuals use their advanced perspective-taking abilities for strategic or malevolent reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:26">[01:32:26]</a>.

The focus should be on understanding the "consistency of performance within a developmental range" for a single person, rather than classifying entire individuals or populations at a fixed level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.

Today's discussion features Forrest Landry, a thinker, writer, and philosopher, who explores his work on [[immanent_metaphysics_and_its_concepts | Immanent Philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This work, accessible via a website version, offers a serious attempt to build an understanding of the universe from basic fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Why Immanent Metaphysics is a Worthwhile Undertaking

Landry believes that understanding the nature of choice is crucial given modern challenges like existential risk and civilization design, which relate to ethical concerns and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This understanding helps in making sensible and grounded choices at community levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Key questions include:
*   What is the nature of choice? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
*   How do we make choices? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>
*   Is choice even real? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   How do we conceive of goodness or choice? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
*   What is the basic methodology for knowing anything at all? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

The goal is to better understand the implications of our vast body of knowledge to improve design and choice-making, both individually and collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Defining Metaphysics: Beyond Traditional Bounds

Traditionally, [[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | metaphysics]] asks two primary questions: "what is?" (ontology, study of existence/being) and "how do we know?" (epistemology, nature of knowledge/consciousness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Other branches, like axiology (what's valuable) and aesthetics (what's beautiful), extend from this core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Landry's work defines [[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | metaphysics]] more narrowly as "an inquiry into the nature of the relation between [[self_and_reality_in_metaphysical_studies | self]] and reality," or the "interaction between the subjective and the objective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This contrasts with historical figures like Kant and Aristotle, whose [[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | metaphysics]] often delved into the nature of the ground of being and theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### The Primacy of Relationship
Landry posits that the relationship between the subjective and the objective is real and fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This relationship, or the process of perceiving, is considered more fundamental than both the perceiver (subjective) and the perceived (objective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. This means we can only know the objective and subjective through the "mediology" of their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

*   **Perceiver, Perceived, and Perceiving:** These form a fundamental triplicate. Perception can only perceive the perceived (the object of perception), not the perceiver or the act of perceiving itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Distinction of Concepts:** Landry distinguishes between *to exist*, *to be real*, and *to be objective* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, asserting they are three distinct claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This careful distinction is crucial for deep foundational inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Relationship as Ontological Class:** The relationship between the perceiver and the perceived (e.g., content and context) is considered its own fundamental category, not merely an element of either <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This concept of relatedness is encoded in much of science, including general relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

### Defining [[self_and_reality_in_metaphysical_studies | Self]]
In this work, [[self_and_reality_in_metaphysical_studies | self]] is defined as the product of "all the choices you have made and all the choices you could make" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. This encompasses both actuality (what has been) and potentiality (what could be) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>, effectively memory plus capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.

## [[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | Metaphysics]] and Quantum Foundations

Landry's perspective on quantum mechanics leans towards interpretations that focus on "measurement itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>. He views quantum mechanics as understanding the relationship between the space of possibility/probability and the space of forces in time, contrasting it with general relativity which conceives of patterns in space relative to forces in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.

Landry is more interested in the "phenomenology of the theories themselves" â€“ what concepts are put into what relationships to one another, viewing mathematics as encoded philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>. His approach aligns with "physics from Fisher information," which treats measurement as an information-theoretic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>.

He acknowledges that current quantum foundational theories lack experimental differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:54">[02:17:54]</a>. For Landry, the purpose of [[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | metaphysics]] is to provide "clear concepts that can then be used by things like science, physics in particular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>. It answers "what" questions (descriptive process), while physics answers "why" questions (modeling process), and [[role_of_technology_and_science | technology]] answers "how to do something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>. Metaphysics aims to clarify questions so experiments can yield new knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>.

## Fundamental Distinctions: Relation vs. Interaction

Landry distinguishes:
*   **Relation:** Atemporal; structures of relationships, as studied in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. If a mathematical truth is proven, it has always been true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:58">[03:13:58]</a>.
*   **Interaction:** Inherently temporal; involves a flow of information (e.g., from objective to subjective), implying possibilities and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>. Interaction can construct information theory, communication theory, and causation ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:11">[03:31:11]</a>.

The concept of an observer is "implied in the notion of interaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:27">[03:46:27]</a>. Landry asserts that the epistemic process (knowing) is more basic than the being of objective or subjective entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:18">[03:19:18]</a>. The notion of interaction is more fundamental than existence, and even more fundamental than creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:58">[04:02:58]</a>. The universe, in his view, is understood through the perfected knowledge of creation, existence, and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:50">[04:10:50]</a>.

### Soundness vs. Validity
Landry clarifies that mathematics focuses on **validity** (formal proof within an axiomatic system), while his [[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | metaphysics]] is more interested in **soundness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:54">[04:55:54]</a>. Soundness refers to the practical correspondence between a mathematical model and a real-world domain (e.g., psychology or engineering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Reifying Power
**Reifying power** means clarifying vague relationships and making concepts more useful and trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:48">[04:51:48]</a>. It's about taking something vague and making its structural relationships more definite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:19">[04:52:19]</a>. This is akin to a powerful metaphor that connects previously disconnected concepts deeply and quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:58">[05:43:58]</a>. The value of this [[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | metaphysics]] is in its ability to increase clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:19">[04:52:19]</a>, like testing if a revised conceptualization of literature increases understanding for its readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Mind, Brain, and Consciousness

### Cartesian Dualism
Cartesian dualism concerns the relationship between mind and matter, or substance in the world versus beings in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>. Historically, this involves two traditions:
1.  Substance is primary, and minds/bodies are composed of it (realism/classical physics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
2.  Consciousness (e.g., deity) is primary, subdividing into individual beings who project the world (idealism/mystical traditions like Kabbalah) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.

Landry's work contrasts with both, stating that the *relationship* between realism and idealism (mind and body) is the primary subject of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. He doesn't posit the unconditional existence of either the objective or subjective but describes their relationship as unconditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

### The Hard Problem of Consciousness
Landry agrees that current neuroscience focuses on observed neural correlates, but even perfected knowledge of these correlations wouldn't answer the hard problem of consciousness <a class="yt="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. The hard problem asks "why is this moment this one?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Correlations don't explain causation, temporality, or the distinction between past, present, and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.

For Landry, consciousness is a process, and its connection to time is intrinsic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. It's also bound to the concept of "hard random" (potentiality or probability over possibility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>. The subjective being is directly connected to temporality, process, and the possibility of other outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. The hard problem stems from physics, described in a purely physicalist sense, not providing tools to explain the symmetry breaking that localizes consciousness to a specific time, space, and possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.

Ultimately, while science (through a third-person perspective) can build objective knowledge, there remains the challenge of understanding the process that moves from a third-person perspective to a first-person one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:54">[01:22:54]</a>. This requires a different kind of toolset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>.

The distinction between genuine thinking and simulated thinking is explored as a foundational concept for understanding societal challenges and potential futures. This concept differentiates between an open, exploratory mode of thought and a more habitual, often artificial, form of processing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Thinking (Contemplation/Seeking Mode)

Genuine thinking, also referred to as "contemplation" or "seeking mode," is characterized by an open and exploring awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. It involves an endeavor to bias perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a> and to truly, deeply contemplate what is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This mode is essential when confronting novel or uncertain environments, such as tracking in hunting or operating in a combat environment where signals may be obfuscated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. In such scenarios, a wide-open awareness, sensitive to non-obvious signals, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Simulated Thinking (Habit Mode)

Simulated thinking is a state where the "habit mind" takes itself as the whole of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. This mode is extremely efficient for behaviors or functions that are well-understood or reduced to habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

Key characteristics and examples of simulated thinking include:
*   **Efficiency over Understanding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>: In educational settings, the focus often shifts from true understanding to the ability to repeat back correct answers with precision and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Operating from Schema** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>: Individuals use pre-loaded schema to respond to conversational gambits or environmental events, acting almost exclusively out of habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness in Ordinary Circumstances** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>: Simulated thinking can be very effective in predictable, "ordinary" environments, such as performing accounting tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a> or routine driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Ineffectiveness in Novel Environments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>: It becomes extremely ineffective in novel or complex situations, as the habit mind is less fluidly related to genuine seeking mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

A significant portion of modern [[cultural_and_social_influences_on_thought_processes | culture]] has been described as artificial and optimized, fostering simulated thinking over genuine thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This can lead to a "trap" where individuals assume their habit mind encompasses all of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Implications in Organizations and Society

Simulated thinking is prevalent in large organizations, where conversations often lack true contemplation and dominate interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This can lead to organizations being caught unprepared for change, as seen with the collapse of Hechinger's due to its inability to adapt to Home Depot and Lowe's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. The inability to engage in genuine thinking, especially during times of exponential change, can lead to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

### Game A and Simulated Thinking

The concept of "Game A" refers to the current societal operating system, characterized by conditions that tend to give rise to simulated thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. This system is described as operating "relatively far from nature, relatively far from the uncertain or from the wild from complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. In "King's Landing" (a metaphor for highly structured society), simulated thinking is a good strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. However, when faced with "winter" or nature, simulated thinking can be catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

Game A is fundamentally vulnerable to "defection," or free-riding, due to its reliance on "society" (formal, scaled relationships) and "identity" (formal, generic labels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>. Society, as a "complicated" system, is fragile and vulnerable to corruption from within and changes in the physical environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>.

As society becomes more complicated, it struggles to manage the "complex" reality of human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>. This leads to kludges, gaps, and fissures that are exploited by individual or group defection, causing a downward spiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:45:00">[35:45:00]</a>. This pattern is observable in historical collapses like the Roman Republic or Chinese dynasties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:18:00">[41:18:00]</a>.

Modern society, particularly in the West, is seen as being in the late stages of Game A, with increasing corruption in areas like finance and politics, and a collapse in [[game_b_and_collective_sensemaking | collective sensemaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. The proliferation of ideas like climate change denial, and the increasing permissibility of public lying, are symptoms of this decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>.

China's "Social Credit" system is identified as a "last gasp Game A" effort to maximize complication using sophisticated [[Mind and Artificial Intelligence | AI]] to manage human choice-making, creating a highly granular and policed social system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. However, this is predicted to collapse within a relatively brief timeframe due to the inherent flaws of Game A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.

## Moving Beyond Simulated Thinking: The Promise of Game B

The concept of "Game B" proposes an alternative to the current Game A system, requiring a new "collective intelligence toolkit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. Game B aims to solve human needs without being constrained by the problems of complicated systems, and thus, without relying on society or identity in the Game A sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>.

Game B seeks to maintain the level of coherence and complexity found in early hunter-gatherer bands (operating within Dunbar's number) but scale it up to include billions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>. This involves:
*   **Personal Transformation**: Acknowledging that individuals need "healing" from the "Holocaust level nastiness" inflicted by Game A's educational systems and [[cognitive_science_and_emotional_reasoning | psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. This means enabling people to be mature adults capable of using their "whole mind to be thinking and not simulated thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>.
*   **New Institutions and "Psycho-technologies"**: Developing technologies for effective group facilitation, enabling individuals with distinct epistemological frameworks (e.g., Christian fundamentalists and atheists) to engage in "truly functional [[cognitive_synergy_in_agi_development | collective intelligence]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>. This would allow for a synergistic capacity where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Global Connectivity**: Utilizing global connectivity to identify and connect individuals with unique "asymmetric information or capacity" (like the mathematician Ramanujan) and bring them into collective intelligence environments supported by these new psycho-technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. This addresses [[current_limitations_of_ai_in_multistep_reasoning and creativity | current limitations of AI]].

Game B is envisioned as a system that is "theoretically optimal conditions for maximal innovation" and "maximum creative collaboration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>, offering an "escape velocity in techno utopia space" without the catastrophic consequences of exponential technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:57">[01:32:57]</a>. It is founded on living in relationship with "what is actually real and true," offering a significant competitive advantage over Game A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

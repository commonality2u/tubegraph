Protopian [[narratology_and_metaphysics | narratology]] is a philosophical discipline developed by Alexander Bard and Jan Sjunnesson as part of their "Grand Narrative Trilogy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. It focuses on the various kinds of stories humans tell about themselves and each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, distinguishing between different narrative forms and their purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Core Concepts

The framework identifies three key types of [[role_of_narrative_in_management_and_decisionmaking | narratives]]:

*   **Logos** The "truth as a fact," representing what actually happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Logos is considered coherent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:00">[51:28:00]</a>.
*   **Mythos** How humans tell stories about facts, incorporating imagination and fantasy to define what it means to be human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. Mythos is invented and projected onto history and future fantasies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>, and is also considered coherent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>.
*   **Pathos** The "pathical [[role_of_narrative_in_management_and_decisionmaking | narrative]]" is inherently incoherent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:35:00">[51:35:00]</a>. It encompasses stories about sex, violence, the subconscious, human drives, desires, rivalry, and envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:40:00">[51:40:00]</a>. Pathos is a fundamental part of humanity and the world, and must be dealt with rather than suppressed, as attempts to ban it (like in Christianity and Islam) lead to explosive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00:00">[52:00:00]</a>. Tantra in Eastern philosophy is cited as a method for engaging with pathos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:03:00">[52:03:00]</a>. Sex, art, and violence are placed in the category of pathos, as they are never harmonious or balanced and represent powerful, "pharmacon" forces that must be actively dealt with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:46:00">[52:46:00]</a>.

### Distinguishing Ethos

Ethos, while related, is not considered a [[role_of_narrative_in_management_and_decisionmaking | narrative]] in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:10:00">[53:10:00]</a>. Instead, it represents "what is the right thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:15:00">[53:15:00]</a>, functioning as pure ethics distinct from morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:20:00">[53:20:00]</a>. Ethos is a *result* of the other [[role_of_narrative_in_management_and_decisionmaking | narratives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:53:00">[55:53:00]</a>.

## Protopianism: A Contrast to Utopian and Dystopian Thinking

Protopianism emerges as a critical alternative to traditional [[the_critique_of_utopian_and_dystopian_thinking | utopian and dystopian thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.

### Critique of Dualism and Utopianism

Western philosophy, particularly from Plato onward, became "stuck with dualism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>, separating the physical world from spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. This dualistic worldview, prevalent in Christianity and Islam, promises an afterlife and offers a "cheap way out," often serving as an "engine for feudal tyranny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>.

[[the_critique_of_utopian_and_dystopian_thinking | Utopian ideas]] originate from this dualist perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:17]</a>. A perfect world, according to Plato, cannot undergo change, as any change would render it imperfect; thus, it must be a "dead world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. This thinking is deemed dangerous, exemplified by figures like Pol Pot, whose PhD was on Rousseau and who subsequently engaged in horrific acts to achieve a "perfect" society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:34:00">[26:34:00]</a>. Such leaders, described as "boy pharaohs," narcissistically seek to "save the world from itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>.

### Rejecting Dystopianism

Similarly, [[the_critique_of_utopian_and_dystopian_thinking | dystopian worldviews]], which predict a horrible world leading to armageddon, are criticized for creating false [[role_of_narrative_in_management_and_decisionmaking | narratives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11:00">[26:11:00]</a>.

### Embracing Protopianism

Protopianism, in contrast, means tearing down and rebuilding the world every day, continuously seeking slight improvements in its construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>. This approach allows for gradual, ongoing optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:39:00">[36:39:00]</a>. While "leaps" can occur, they are often recognized in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>.

This concept aligns with the monist worldview, emphasizing that "everything in the world is dependent on everything else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>, where even mind and matter are expressions of the same reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>. This perspective links to Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel, and Nietzsche, and resonates strongly with Eastern philosophy (e.g., Daoism, Zoroastrianism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.

## Implications for Societal Design and Progress

Protopianism offers a framework for building new societal models:

### Voluntary Communism and Implotation

The "Game B" movement is described as protopian, seeking a "voluntary communism" where communities experiment with alternative lifestyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>. This involves a shift from "exploitation" (Game A) to "implotation," where resources are only used if they can be returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. This idea acknowledges that game A had benefits, like modern dentistry, but its fundamental flaw was the lack of brakes on exponential growth in a finite world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

The goal is to increase human well-being while decreasing material inputs, with a suggested "three-three transition" (well-being up by a factor of three, material inputs down by a factor of three) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>. This can be achieved by investing in commons and community, incorporating regular holidays, and engaging in activities like singing and exercising to boost serotonin and reduce addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>.

### The Role of Membranes and Protocols

Protopian communities must operate with "membranes," allowing individuals to "walk in and walk out" freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>. This voluntary nature prevents totalitarianism, which forces inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>. These membranes are semi-permeable, requiring effort to enter or exit, mirroring biological membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>.

Communities within these membranes can adopt "protocols," which are shared standards that determine how the community operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:14:00">[47:14:00]</a>. Unlike rigid laws, protocols are designed to be copied and shared, facilitating communication and cooperation between different communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[47:17:00]</a>. Examples include communal agreements on technology use, such as banning smartphones for children within a community to mitigate negative social externalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:58:00">[41:58:00]</a>.

### Societal Evolution through Anarchy and Plurality

Technological disruptions initially lead to anarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>. This then shifts into a "plurality," where certain individuals or groups (an "elite") figure out how to properly use the new technology to their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:49:00">[43:49:00]</a>. Their successful models can then be mimicked by others, leading to a new order out of chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:26:00">[44:26:00]</a>.

### The Future and Existence

The "Symbiotic Intelligence" is favored over "artificial intelligence" (AI), recognizing technology's inherent link to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to ensure technology works in humanity's favor before self-extinction, particularly given the existence of destructive technologies like the atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

The possibility that humanity might be the "first and only general intelligence in the universe" is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>, raising questions related to the [[implications_for_seti_and_fermi_paradox | Fermi Paradox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. This unique position, supported by [[anthropic_principle_and_theories_of_reality | transfinite mathematics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>, implies a responsibility to ensure humanity's long-term survival, which may involve fewer people living longer through implotative practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. Exploration of space, while potentially important in the long term, is currently seen as a rehash of "exploitative ideas" if Earth's problems are not addressed first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

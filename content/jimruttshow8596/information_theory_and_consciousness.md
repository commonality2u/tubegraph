Terrence Deacon's work, particularly in his book *Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter*, offers a profound re-evaluation of how [[consciousness and its origins | consciousness]] and [[emergent_complexity_and_consciousness | emergent complexity]] arise from physical processes, fundamentally challenging traditional reductionist views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. His theories integrate concepts from evolutionary biology, neuroscience, and [[theories_of_consciousness | information theory]], proposing a hierarchical framework of dynamic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## The Significance of Absence

A foundational concept in Deacon's argument is "absence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. He posits that absences are not merely voids but active components in the universe, shaping phenomena from the meaning of words to the very nature of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The meaning of words, for instance, isn't inherent in their sound but refers to something not physically present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This "constitutive absence" is central to understanding purposes, meanings, and values—concepts often difficult to integrate into physical theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Deacon likens this challenge to the historical difficulty Western mathematics faced with the concept of zero. Just as zero marks a value for nothing that enables recursive number systems and calculus, understanding absence is key to grasping how complex phenomena like [[theories_of_consciousness | mind]] emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The ability to work with infinitely small divisions in calculus, akin to dealing with absence and infinity, provided a path forward for problems like Zeno's paradox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

For living systems, "absence" is fundamental because their existence requires constant work to defy the tendency towards breakdown (entropy increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Living processes are always directed towards "something that doesn't yet exist"—maintaining their existence or bringing new things into the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Orthograde and Contra-grade Dynamics

To articulate how complex systems emerge, Deacon introduces two terms:
*   **Orthograde:** Processes that happen spontaneously, requiring no work or effort, typically running "downhill" towards equilibrium or increasing entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. Examples include a constant velocity object in space or a messy desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.
*   **Contra-grade:** Processes that go "against the flow" of spontaneous tendencies, requiring work or effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. Staying organized, maintaining a refrigerator's coldness, or even logically consistent thinking are contra-grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

These concepts extend beyond physics to thermodynamics and even thought processes, providing a generic way to describe how work is done to maintain or create order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.

## Three Layers of Emergence

Deacon proposes three distinct layers of emergence, each built upon the previous one through specific dynamics of constraints:

1.  **Homeodynamics:** These are the most pervasive dynamics in the universe, characterized by orthograde changes that tend towards homogenization and equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. While particles may move, the overall gradients and patterns remain stable at equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.

2.  **Morphodynamics:** These processes are contra-grade, generating order and regularity by pouring energy through a system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. Examples include whirlpools, convection cells, or snow crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>. While they produce order, they also speed up the dissipation of the very gradients that sustain them, making them inherently self-destructive unless frozen in a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Morphodynamic processes are rarer than homeodynamic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>.

3.  **Teleodynamics:** This is the highest and rarest form of emergence, characteristic of [[consciousness agency and biological information processing | living processes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. Teleodynamic systems arise from the strategic juxtaposition of morphodynamic processes that balance and support each other, preventing their mutual dissipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. This creates a system that maintains and reproduces its own order, directed towards an "absent end" (its own continued existence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Unlike morphodynamic systems that wear out, teleodynamic systems can amplify themselves, which explains the spread of life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>.

### Autogenesis: A Model for Teleodynamics
To concretely illustrate teleodynamics, Deacon proposes the "autogen" model – a thought experiment designed to be empirically testable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. An autogen involves two interdependent morphodynamic processes:
*   **Reciprocal Catalysis:** Two catalysts (A and B) mutually generate each other, rapidly increasing their concentration and using up raw materials, a self-undermining process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.
*   **Capsid (Container) Formation:** A crystal-like shell made of molecules (G) that tends to form in areas of high concentration. This process also depletes raw materials and eventually stops growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

In the autogen, the catalytic process generates the molecules needed for capsid growth, while the capsid contains the catalysts, preventing them from diffusing away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. This creates a self-repairing and self-reproducing unit: if broken, the spilled catalysts immediately begin making more catalysts and capsids, tending to self-close again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. This system embodies the concept of "absences generating new absences"—the constraints that define its form are reproduced, rather than merely existing as physical stuff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.

## Rethinking Information

Deacon's framework redefines [[integrated_information_theory_and_its_implications | information]] beyond traditional Shannon entropy:

*   **Shannon Information:** Focuses on the engineering problem of transmitting signals, measuring how much a message can be carried by constraints on possible variety, without reference to meaning or usefulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.

*   **Boltzmann Entropy:** Refers to physical entropy, the degradation of the physical medium over time that interferes with information transmission (noise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. The distinction between noise and signal is not intrinsic but depends on interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

*   **Bateson's "Difference that Makes a Difference":** Gregory Bateson proposed information as a "difference that makes a difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>. Deacon expands this to mean a difference that *matters* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. For something to matter, a system must be future-oriented and maintain its existence, distinguishing between "self" and "other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. This introduces a "normative character" where things are categorized as good/bad, right/wrong, useful/dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>. Only [[consciousness agency and biological information processing | teleodynamic systems]] can interpret information in this normative way, as they are organized around their own persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

## Sentience and the Brain

Deacon defines **sentience** broadly as the ability of a teleodynamic system to be differentially reactive to its environment in a way that maintains itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>. This simple form of sentience can be seen in the autogen model (which breaks open in a supportive environment, enabling self-repair) or in plants (roots seeking nutrients, leaves turning to light) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>. This represents a transition from "chemistry to normative chemistry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>.

### Subjective Sentience and Brains
Brains, particularly complex ones, represent a higher level of emergence, producing **subjective sentience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>. While simple sentience is immediately reactive, subjective sentience involves creating representations or models of possible futures and alternatives in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>.

Deacon proposes that individual neurons are themselves teleodynamic processes, constantly striving to maintain themselves amidst disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. The brain, therefore, is a nested [[consciousness agency and biological information processing | teleodynamic process of teleodynamic processes]]—a network of self-maintaining units that collectively maintain the larger organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>. This perspective suggests that understanding [[theories_of_consciousness | consciousness]] requires looking beyond individual neurons to the emergent dynamics across multiple layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:03">[01:33:03]</a>.

### The Role of Feeling and Attention
*   **Feeling as Primary:** For Deacon, feeling is fundamental to cognition, serving as the very basis of sentience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:39">[01:35:39]</a>. Feelings arise from "work" or contra-grade relationships where spontaneous processes are disturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:59">[01:35:59]</a>. Emotions, for instance, reflect the inertia of these dynamic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:11">[01:37:11]</a>.
*   **Dynamics, Not States:** Mental phenomena like thinking, feeling, and representing are intrinsic dynamic processes, not static computational states or "switch settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:07">[01:43:07]</a>. A representation is a "dynamical form" or "melody" generated by the morphodynamics of brain regions, rather than fixed synaptic weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:57">[01:44:57]</a>.
*   **Attention as Work:** Attention is experienced as effort, a contra-grade process where the nervous system initiates work to resolve a conflict between spontaneous tendencies (e.g., daydreaming) and external or internal demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>.
*   **The Job of [[theories_of_consciousness | Consciousness]]:** [[theories_of_consciousness | Consciousness]] is a process that constantly tries to "destroy itself" by making things unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:04">[01:49:04]</a>. Our brains prioritize information that "makes a difference" (a novel input or unmet need) over constant, predictable inputs (like the feeling of toes in shoes), pushing the latter to an unconscious, automatic level to manage limited processing bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a>.

## Challenging the Hard Problem

Deacon suggests that the "hard problem" of [[theories_of_consciousness | consciousness]], articulated by David Chalmers, is akin to Zeno's paradox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:22">[01:52:22]</a>. The more we analyze the brain at finer levels (synapses, neurotransmitters), the further we seem from understanding subjective experience. This suggests a fundamental disconnect, leading some to conclude that [[scientific_study_of_consciousness | consciousness]] is beyond scientific inquiry or a form of dualism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>.

Deacon argues this perceived "hardness" comes from looking at the wrong side of the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">[01:55:02]</a>. Just as Zeno's paradox was resolved by understanding zero, the hard problem can be approached by recognizing that "absences matter" and are fundamental to emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:40">[01:55:40]</a>. Our experience and existence are not merely the physical stuff (which constantly changes) but the dynamic system of constraints that maintains itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:29">[01:56:29]</a>. These constraints define form and absence, enable work, and lead to new kinds of constraints, perpetuating an [[emergent_complexity_and_consciousness | emergent process]] that defines what we are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:31">[01:57:31]</a>.

## Defining Consciousness
[[Concept of consciousness | Consciousness]] is described as the subjective, immediate experience of the world, something that can be experienced rather than measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It is defined as "being aware that you are aware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This distinction is made between "self-consciousness," which is limited to a very small number of animals like humans, chimpanzees, elephants, and orcas, and "primary consciousness," which is believed to be much more widespread, potentially since reptiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Gerald Edelman, a researcher on [[Concept of consciousness | consciousness]], made a similar distinction between primary [[Concept of consciousness | consciousness]] (shared with dogs) and extended [[Concept of consciousness | consciousness]] (higher up the evolutionary timeline, including humans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. A simple test case for self-consciousness is a mirror test: dogs bark at their reflection, while apes and elephants eventually recognize themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## The User Illusion
The concept of the "[[user_illusion_of_consciousness | user illusion]]" likens the mind to a graphical user interface in computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Just as a desktop, folders, and files on a computer screen are metaphors for underlying data, the mind provides an "illusion" of manipulating objects that are not literally present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This illusion is a way to help the user interact with complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

The analogy extends to our perception of the world: our mind's image of the world is not an attempt to perfectly reproduce reality, but rather to create a relevant "myth" or illusion that aids the survival of the organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The criterion for this mental model is not accuracy, but its utility for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This aligns with a Darwinian view of evolution, where the cognitive model's payoff is measured in terms of reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. [[Concept of consciousness | Consciousness]] is considered a "clever hack" or trick that evolution found to enable high-quality decisions at relatively low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The human brain, despite consuming 20% of the body's energy, and the significant genetic cost for the [[Emergence of mind from brain | emergence of consciousness]], demonstrates its survival value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Information Bandwidth and Reduction
A surprising finding in [[Concept of consciousness | consciousness]] studies is the narrow bandwidth of conscious awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. While the human brain receives approximately 11 million bits of information per second from the environment (mostly vision), conscious awareness processes only about 16 bits per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. This represents a compression factor of about a million times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

This massive reduction of information is essential because most incoming data is not immediately relevant; for example, the ceiling not falling down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. [[Concept of consciousness | Consciousness]], therefore, is largely about discarding information and reducing it to what is meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This understanding was aided by advances in the "physics of information," which showed that information is physical and subject to physical laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. A key insight is that erasing information is physically expensive, unlike merely transferring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. This concept was central to resolving Maxwell's demon problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

## The "I" and the "Me"
A key distinction proposed to understand the conscious and unconscious mind is between the "I" (consciousness) and the "me" (the person as a whole, including unconscious processes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

### Libet's Experiment and Free Will
This distinction helps explain the results of Benjamin Libet's famous experiments on the delay of conscious awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Libet built upon earlier findings by Kornhuber and Deecke, who showed that brain activity (electric potential) begins approximately one second before a person makes a conscious decision to perform a simple action, such as flicking a finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. Libet's experiments revealed that the conscious decision to act occurs roughly half a second after the brain has already begun preparing for the action, and half a second before the action is executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

This implies that the conscious "I" does not initiate actions; rather, the "me" (the entire person's system, including unconscious processes) does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. Therefore, while the conscious "I" may not have free will in initiating actions, the "me" still does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. This perspective resolves the perceived conflict with free will: decisions are made by the person as a whole, even if not consciously initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

Most complex human actions, such as walking, talking, dancing, or playing with children, are performed without conscious awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Conscious awareness often interferes with these automated processes, leading to clumsiness or stuttering if one becomes too aware of how they are performing the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. The conscious mind (the "I") acts more like a CEO who is unaware of the day-to-day operations of the company, with the "staff" (unconscious processes) handling most tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

While Libet proposed a "veto power" for [[Concept of consciousness | consciousness]]—the ability to consciously stop an action that has already begun to be prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>—the deeper argument is to relocate the concept of free will from the "I" to the "me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. This perspective acknowledges that causality exists at a fundamental level, but that the complexity of emergent phenomena makes it computationally impossible to predict higher-level behaviors from basic physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

## Historical Evolution of Consciousness
Julian Jaynes's theory, outlined in "The Origin of [[Concept of consciousness | Consciousness]] and the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind," suggests that [[Concept of consciousness | consciousness]] (specifically, self-awareness or the "I") is a relatively recent development in human history, perhaps arising around the time of Homer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>. Jaynes hypothesized that before this development, humans operated without conscious self-awareness, acting based on "parliaments of voices" in their heads, which they interpreted as gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>. The idea of an "inner space" for decision-making was historically new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. People who exhibit this older form of mind today, hearing voices that direct their actions, might be diagnosed as schizophrenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>.

This theory aligns with observations that characters in earlier texts like *The Iliad* appear more "alien" and less self-reflective compared to those in later works like *The Odyssey* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

## Exformation: The Unspoken Context
Communication involves not just explicit "information" but also "exformation"—the vast amount of information that is implicitly assumed or condensed within a message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. An example is the shortest correspondence in history between Victor Hugo and his publisher: a question mark from Hugo ("How is my book doing?") and an exclamation mark back ("It's a huge success!") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. These simple symbols convey immense meaning due to the shared context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

All communication relies on this principle: a small amount of information is exchanged, but a large amount of exformation is produced both by the sender (compressing a mental state into a symbol) and the receiver (unfolding a symbol into a mental state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. Literary fiction, for instance, evokes rich mental models in the reader with relatively few words, assuming a vast amount of shared understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

## Implications for Living
Modern life, often called the "Information Society," is ironically characterized by an emptying of information from our environments, particularly analog information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>. Simplified, controlled environments like cities and suburbs contain less information than wild or natural landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. This reduction in environmental dimensionality leads to a craving for information, which is often sought unfulfillingly through digital means like smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

To enhance well-being, humanity needs to seek out more "otherness" and things that cannot be controlled or foreseen, such as wilderness or unpredictable interactions with other human beings and species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. The pursuit of happiness through the removal of all annoying things (like rain, wind, pests) has paradoxically led to a lack of genuine happiness, which comes from engagement with the complex, uncontrolled aspects of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.

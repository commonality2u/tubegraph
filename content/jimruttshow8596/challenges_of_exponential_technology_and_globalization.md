The modern world faces unique problems due to [[Technological evolution and societal impact | exponential technology]] and digital globalization that were not encountered previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. These challenges necessitate new problem-solving capacities, new social institutions, and new forms of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The New Problem Landscape
The current landscape is defined by increased complexity, scale, and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, which means that existing problem-solving processes are often inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. They either fail to solve problems entirely or cause worse, cumulative problems through externalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Humanity's historical solutions to problems have led to the major issues faced today, such as environmental degradation from wealth creation or existential weapons from national security pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

### Quantitative Differences Becoming Qualitative Changes
A critical insight is that changes in quantity can cross thresholds to become changes in type or quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This means a new world requires new social systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Specific Challenges
Several key areas highlight the [[Technological and societal challenges | challenges]] of exponential technology and globalization:

### Military Capacity and Existential Risk
The continuous evolution of military capacity, from catapults to cannons, transformed dramatically with the advent of the nuclear bomb in World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This marked a discontinuity because humanity gained the ability to destroy the habitability of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. This new scale meant a local war could damage humanity as a whole, introducing human self-induced existential risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The Bretton Woods system was an attempt to mediate this by fostering technological and economic interdependence, making war unprofitable and enabling massive positive-sum dynamics through globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Planetary Boundaries
The rapid growth enabled by globalization has led to hitting planetary boundaries, an issue that was never a concern before due to limited human population, power, and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. For example, humans now have enough power to overfish entire oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### Global Supply Chains
The world has become dependent on radically complicated global supply chains, where a break in one place can create cascading failures, as observed during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

### Information and Media Landscape
The role of information and media has significantly eroded, particularly in open societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The problem landscape has become complex, while the quality of civic discourse has decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

*   **Impact of Digital Platforms:** Modern information curation monopolies like Facebook, YouTube, and Google operate differently from traditional broadcast media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. Their business model, based on advertising and optimizing for "time on site," inadvertently leads to increased polarization and extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. This is because limbic hijacking through fear, in-group identity, and outrage keeps users engaged longer than nuanced, complex content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.
*   **Runaway Confirmation Bias:** Digital platforms facilitate a "runaway confirmation bias," where slight evidence supporting an existing worldview is accepted as truth, even when evidence is ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. This leads to predictable responses based on subgroup affiliation rather than original thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   **Censorship and Public Square:** The enormous scale of platforms like Facebook, with 2.2 billion users, effectively makes them the public square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. Their arbitrary decisions on what is "in bounds" for public discourse are exceedingly dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.
*   **Fractured National Unity:** The internet and fragmentation of perspectives contribute to a lack of national unity and increased internal infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:43">[00:55:43]</a>. This makes long-term planning difficult and can lead to a "dying system undergoing institutional decay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.

## Impact on Governance and Society
The founding fathers of the U.S. understood that education and a free press were prerequisites for a functioning republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. However, the current problemscape is very different from what they faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Modern [[Challenges in current civilization methods and systems | civilization]] needs new social capacities and governance approaches because traditional systems like feudalism, socialism, communism, or [[Challenges and dynamics of modern capitalism | capitalism]] are inadequate to the current problem space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Theories of markets from the Scottish Enlightenment, for instance, did not account for AI, drones, and digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Consequences of Failure
If internal infighting and a lack of coordination continue, societies risk being out-coordinated by unified, autocratic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>. The 21st century could be run by [[The impact of technology and algorithms on society | exponential tech empowered autocracy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. Culture wars drive cultural arms races, which, due to [[Clusters of technology and their impact on society | exponential technology]], can lead to rapid and widespread destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>. Without finding ways to coordinate and transcend rivalry, [[Future of civilization and societal challenges | civilization]] faces existential threats from exponential direct destruction or indirect destruction through externalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>.

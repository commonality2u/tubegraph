The [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_military_strategy | Russo-Ukrainian War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, observed over two years and a few months, has provided critical insights into modern warfare, challenging many long-held assumptions for military strategists and historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Jim Rut, the host of the Jim Rut Show, and his guest, Sam Boria from Bismar Analysis, explored key [[military_strategies_and_warfare_in_Ukraine | military strategies and warfare in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, technological shifts, and broader geopolitical implications.

## Obsolescence of Military Stockpiles and Traditional Hardware

A significant lesson is that military stockpiles, especially of older equipment, are far less useful than previously assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This is due to two main factors:
*   **High Attrition Rates**: The rate of attrition in drone-intensified warfare is very high for equipment ranging from tanks and trucks to artillery shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Technological Evolution**: The next war will be waged with even more transformed technological tools, making it difficult to predict what to stockpile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. For example, Ukraine is now producing 80,000 suicide drones a month, a massive and unforeseen scaling up of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This rapid evolution means that equipment quickly becomes obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

There is institutional resistance to acknowledging this transformation, as it would mean telling large military contractors that their product lines are obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## Shift from Offensive to Defensive Dominance

The war has highlighted a historical trend of shifting between offensive and defensive dominance, often driven by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. While World War II saw a return to mobile warfare with tanks and air power, the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_analysis | current Russia-Ukraine conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> has shown a return to defensive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>. Inexpensive anti-tank weapons and drones have made traditional mobile warfare much less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>, reverting to a form of positional warfare, reminiscent of trench warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

## Russian Miscalculations

Sam Boria identified four major factors contributing to Russian miscalculations at the war's outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>:

1.  **Gambled on Ukrainian Leadership Fleeing**: Russia believed Ukraine's leadership would flee, similar to the collapse of the Afghanistan government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. This gamble proved wrong, as President Zelenskyy remained, and the Ukrainian government found a deep well of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
2.  **Overestimated Mobile Warfare**: Russia greatly overestimated the effectiveness of mobile warfare, expecting a 20th-century tank war on the plains of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Modern drones and anti-tank weapons rendered this strategy less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.
3.  **Underestimated Ukrainian Preparedness**: Since 2014, Ukraine had significantly improved its military training, acquired modern equipment, and purged Russian sympathizers from its government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. The harsh reality of living in Russian puppet states in Donbas also turned ethnic Russians and Russian speakers against the Russian cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>.
4.  **Underestimated Corruption in [[russian_military_tactics_and_strategy | Russian Military]]**: Both Western analysts and the Russians themselves underestimated the pervasive corruption within the [[russian_military_tactics_and_strategy | Russian military]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>. This corruption led to widespread supply shortages and dysfunction, hindering their ability to sustain operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. Examples include the use of cheap, low-quality tires on military vehicles due to corrupt supply sergeants selling off original ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:41]</a>.

## Importance of Reserves and Mobilization

Ukraine's ability to rapidly expand its active military from 200,000 to 700,000 personnel by July 2022 demonstrated the critical importance of a massive reserve force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>. This allowed Ukraine to achieve a significant numerical advantage on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>.

This highlights the need for countries to reconsider their reserve forces and potentially reintroduce mandatory military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>. The US, for instance, has a smaller reserve force in absolute numbers than Ukraine, despite its much larger population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>. Long, multi-year, peer-to-peer wars necessitate deep stacks of reserves, both ready and inactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>.

Furthermore, the war has been fought by two demographically "old" countries, with average ages around 40.5-40.7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:00">[28:48:00]</a>. This implies a potential shift where older individuals are more involved in combat roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>.

## Transformative Role of Drones

Drones have revolutionized warfare in ways comparable to the evolution of aviation in World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>:
*   **Off-the-shelf Components**: Militarily useful drones can be built from readily available civilian electronic components, cameras, and engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:13:00">[35:13:00]</a>.
*   **Skilled Pilots with Reduced Risk**: Drones allow pilots to gain thousands of hours of combat flight experience with almost no risk of personal death, leading to highly skilled operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>. Young people, with faster response times and higher neuroplasticity, may be optimally suited for drone piloting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:17:00]</a>.
*   **Obsolescence of Manned Air Forces**: Drones, with their reconnaissance and munition delivery capabilities, have largely obsoleted traditional manned air forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:18:00">[42:18:00]</a>. Highly expensive F-22 fighters ($300 million each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:33:00">[43:33:00]</a> and aircraft carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:39:00">[46:39:00]</a> become vulnerable "sitting ducks" in a peer-to-peer conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:47:00">[47:47:00]</a>.
*   **Industrial Transformation**: The war has spurred an industrial transformation, with countries now prioritizing building their own drones for rapid adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:23:00">[40:23:00]</a>. Ukraine, for instance, may become a top global drone producer post-war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>.

## Artillery's Resurgence

Artillery remains a crucial component of warfare, even in a technologically advanced conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="4:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Massive Consumption**: Tens of thousands, even millions, of artillery shells have been expended daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. This has revealed shortfalls in production capabilities, forcing Russia to buy from North Korea and Ukraine from South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>.
*   **Immune to ECM**: Artillery shells are "dumb drones" that cannot be countered by electronic measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>. In a positional warfare scenario, where maneuver is difficult due to surveillance and suicide drones, artillery's advantage returns, enabling the shelling of zones to deny enemy access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.
*   **Synergy with Drones**: Surveillance drones can provide live targeting updates for artillery pieces, creating a powerful pairing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

## Economic Exchange Ratios

Modern warfare highlights the critical role of cost ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. The asymmetric exchange of a $1,000 Ukrainian drone potentially destroying a $2 million Russian tank creates a devastating economic disadvantage for the side relying on expensive, traditional hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. This unsustainable ratio can be decisive in a long war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.

## Implications for a Potential Taiwan Conflict

Lessons from the [[russiaukraine_war_analysis | Russia-Ukraine War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> provide critical insights for a hypothetical conflict in the Straits of Taiwan:

*   **Effectiveness of Sanctions**: Countries now know that sanctions only matter if both China and the US impose them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. If sanctioned only by the US and its allies, a country can survive economically with China's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>. This impacts the calculus of nations trying to balance relations with both powers.
*   **Untested Military Capabilities**: The war demonstrated that an untested military cannot be relied upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. China's military, despite its hardware investments, has not been stress-tested in a major conflict since the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>. Its bureaucracy and logistical capabilities may be deeply flawed by corruption and lack of practical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.
*   **Autocratic Regimes and Public Opinion**: The Russian experience shows that autocratic countries can easily get their population on board with aggressive wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. Theories that internal dissent would overthrow Putin proved incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>, suggesting a similar outcome in China.
*   **Drone Swarms**: The short distance across the Taiwan Strait means that massive numbers of drones could fly over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. An "electric motor air flight invasion" of hundreds of thousands of drones could potentially overwhelm Taiwanese defenses, enforce curfews via loudspeakers, and disrupt civilian life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>.
*   **Amphibious Assault Challenges**: The relative lack of amphibious warfare in Ukraine, coupled with the defensive advantage favored by modern technology, makes a traditional amphibious assault on Taiwan seem even more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. Ukraine's success in driving the Russian Navy out of the eastern Black Sea using inexpensive anti-ship missiles (like the Neptune) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a> demonstrates the vulnerability of large naval fleets to asymmetric, precision strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>.
*   **Autonomous Submersible Vehicles**: A potential blockade strategy could involve deploying thousands of autonomous submersible drones that act as self-deploying, attack mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>, targeting any vessel entering a declared "Red Zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>. This would prompt a new arms race in countermeasures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:11">[01:26:11]</a>.

In conclusion, the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_analysis | Russia-Ukraine conflict analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> has highlighted the critical importance of rapid technological adaptation, domestic production, and ready reserves in modern peer-to-peer warfare, with significant implications for future conflicts like a potential Taiwan Strait crisis.

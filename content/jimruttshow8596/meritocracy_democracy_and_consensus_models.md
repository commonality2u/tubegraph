Forrest Landry, a thinker, writer, and philosopher, explores three archetypal models for human governance: consensus, meritocracy, and democracy. His "small group practice," initially conceptualized before 2000 and published around 2001, outlines a method for these models to work in concert, particularly for groups up to 16 members, to address complex problems facing the world today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Traditional forms of governance, like existing institutions, often struggle with large-scale, complex issues spanning generations, cultures, and diverse actors, such as ecological problems, global warming, pollution, and sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Attempting new, [[innovative_governance_and_decisionmaking_models | innovative things]] within old structures is often a recipe for failure, highlighting the need for fresh thinking in [[the_evolution_and_future_of_societal_governance | societal governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Archetypal Governance Models

Landry posits that consensus, meritocracy, and democracy span the archetypes of human governance and coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Consensus
*   **Description**: Everyone is at the same level, communicating as peers, with horizontal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. It aims for a common understanding and uniform agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Everyone is involved in every choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Strengths**: Makes very high-quality choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. Ensures coherency, especially for internal group definitions like values or membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Consensus on values means everyone in the community agrees, unlike a vote where there are losers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. Values, unlike purposes or actions, are not mutually exclusive and can be positively stated, allowing for parallelism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Weaknesses**: Requires very high communicative bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Can be too slow for large groups or situations requiring quick decisions, as there may not be enough time to reach a decision for every choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Consensus decisions are "sticky," meaning one objector can stop a change, making revisions difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.

### Meritocracy (Hierarchical/Executive)
*   **Description**: A top-down structure with an unequal way of relating, where roles and decision-making authority are delegated, e.g., a CEO in a corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Specific individuals are allocated per choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Strengths**: Can respond very quickly to a large number of choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Relatively simple and robust for emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Weaknesses**: Highly vulnerable to corruption or "agency risk" (also known as the "principal-agent problem"), where individuals make choices for private interests rather than the group's benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This corruption can be hidden or "occult," making it hard to identify from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. If authority exceeds responsibility, it can lead to tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.

### Democracy
*   **Description**: Sits between consensus and meritocracy, involving subgroups with internal equality but potentially hierarchical relationships between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Involves choices through debate followed by a vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Often involves a representational model where agents (e.g., elected officials, congress) act on behalf of principals (citizens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Strengths**: Perceived as a "gold star" in Western thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Weaknesses**: Susceptible to hidden and covert forms of power (e.g., setting ballot wording) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Voting efficiently divides a group into two subgroups, limiting effectiveness and leading to political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This divisiveness makes communities less resilient to external change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The institutional structure of democracy can corrupt how ideas are discussed, framed, and how rhetoric is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## The Small Group Practice: Integrating the Archetypes

Landry's key insight is that while each model has weaknesses, combining all three in a specific way allows them to act as checks and balances, compensating for each other's disadvantages and leveraging their strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. This approach is effective for small groups, ideally 9-12 people, and up to 16, but becomes unstable beyond that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

The practice distinguishes between:
*   **Internal Processes (Consensus-driven)**: Focuses on the group's self-definition, identity, values, and membership. It aims for high coherence. Decisions on internal organization, like defining roles and the scope of external communication, are made by consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
*   **External Processes (Meritocracy-driven)**: Deals with the group's interaction with the outside world, such as farming or external governmental relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Once consensus defines a role's scope and selects a person (or team) based on skill, willingness, and availability, that person or team operates with delegated authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. The meritocratic structure should have clearly partitioned, non-overlapping scopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.

### The Role of Democracy: The "Red Button"
In this model, democracy has a very specific, limited function. It acts as a "red button" to transition the group back to consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.
1.  **Vote of No Confidence**: If the group perceives misrepresentation, incompetence, corruption, or incorrect boundary definition in a meritocratic function, a democratic vote (a true majority of half plus one of the *entire* membership) can "collapse" that specific meritocratic structure back to consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. This forces the group to restart the process of defining the role and appointing a new meritocrat by consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. This is a high-cost action, deterring frivolous use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
2.  **Suspending Consensus**: Democracy can also vote to suspend internal consensus communication for a temporary period (e.g., two weeks) if discussions become too heated or unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. This acts as a relief valve, allowing tempers to cool before resuming internal deliberations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. The rules for such suspensions (e.g., maximum duration) would be established by prior consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

This limited role for democracy is designed to avoid its inherent divisiveness, ensuring that even "losers" of a vote of no confidence become integral participants in the subsequent consensus process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. The consensus group would also define reporting requirements for meritocracies to ensure transparency and accountability, allowing the "democracy" (as the collective decision-making body) to act responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

## Scaling Beyond Small Groups

Landry's later work reveals that the small group model cannot be directly scaled up beyond groups of about 16-30 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. Attempts to create larger groups by accreting smaller ones result in instability, largely due to "intersexual dynamics" and underlying evolutionary forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.

*   **Evolutionary Forces**: Evolution, driven by mutation (additive), survival selection (multiplicative), and mate selection/recombination (exponential), strongly favors hierarchically organized structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>. The recombinatoric effects are far more powerful in shaping information flow and choice-making dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. These "unbounded pressures" prevent direct scaling through accretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.
*   **The Uncanny Valley**: There's an "uncanny valley" or "no man's land" in group size, typically between 16 and approximately 200 people (around the Dunbar number), where traditional institutional forms and small-group processes fail to work effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. Existing institutional forms (businesses, schools, governments, religious organizations) overemphasize hierarchical thinking and market-based processes, which are not responsive over long periods due to low bandwidth and lack of global awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>.
*   **Need for New Principles**: Solving complex problems requires a new approach that goes beyond incremental improvements to existing systems (e.g., voting methodology, financial instruments like cryptocurrency or NFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. These [[economic_systems_and_growth_models | economic systems]] and [[comparison_of_monarchy_and_democracy | current democratic systems]] are insufficient. The fundamental problem lies at the meta-systemic level, where financialized capitalism destabilizes culture and ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.
*   **Conscious Sustainable Evolution**: Future governance architectures for large groups (200+ individuals) must foster "collective wisdom" and "collective intelligence" capable of "holographic communication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This means balancing sustainability (absence of change) with evolution (the ability to adapt and recognize new solutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>. It requires a shift from strategy-first to [[community_credit_and_decisionmaking_in_a_cooperative_economy | culture-first]], where cultural values lead to vision and then strategy, emerging from the community itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.

The challenge is to create a [[political_metamodernism | governance structure]] that is both stable over millennia and can address challenges like existential risk, protecting rainforests, and ensuring global well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>. This involves understanding human psychology and fundamental drivers of human behavior to design governance that addresses causes, not just symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. It also requires balancing the relationship between man, machine, and nature, guiding technology wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>. Such a solution must be genuinely unique and address the deep, complex problems that current models cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>.

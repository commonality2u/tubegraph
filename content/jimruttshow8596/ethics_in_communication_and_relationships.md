Forrest Landry, a recurring guest on the Jim Rutt Show, presents his concept of [[nonrelativistic_ethics | non-relativistic ethics]], which aims to provide universal principles for effective choice, applicable across various situations and even to non-human entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. His framework integrates aspects of consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethics, focusing on increasing integrity and potentiality in self, the world, and their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Distinguishing Ethics from Morality

Landry clarifies the distinction between "ethics" and "morality" to set the scope of his discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>:
*   **Ethics**: Refers to general principles of choice that guide actions, independent of specific contexts or individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. It's about what lives within the "self" that can participate across many different "worlds" or domains of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.
*   **Morality**: Refers to specific "codes" or "rules" that are particular to a certain "game" or "world," like rules in a sports game, workplace, or family setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.

Landry initially states that systems of morality defined in black-and-white terms are fundamentally antithetical to life and consciousness and should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>. However, he later softens this stance, acknowledging the value of well-calibrated rule systems, like legal codes, in reducing cognitive load and fostering societal coherence, while emphasizing that these are human-made constructs that can and should evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

## The Concept of Effective Choice

Central to Landry's [[nonrelativistic_ethics | non-relativistic ethics]] is the idea of "effective choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. An effective choice has two key aspects:
1.  **Consequence**: It creates an effect in the world, making something happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Potentiality**: It results in the potential for future choices, preserving or even increasing the capacity to create change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. This concept is akin to "optionality" in economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

Effective choices are rooted in the pursuit of integrity and the increase of potentiality across "life and evolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:00">[34:33:00]</a>. This means maximizing the combination of symmetry and continuity in the relationship between the self (subjective) and reality (objective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:00">[39:17:00]</a>.

*   **Integrity**: Means "to act as one together," implying coherency, cooperativeness, and a combination of diverse aspects that produce a result greater than the sum of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>.
*   **Symmetry**: Refers to the correspondence between what is at one end of a communication channel (subjective intent) and what is at the other (objective outcome), ensuring faithful representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:00">[41:07:00]</a>.
*   **Continuity**: Refers to the smoothness and consistent energy transmission within the channel, avoiding abrupt shifts that can degrade communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:00">[42:11:00]</a>.

## Self, Perception, and Expression

Landry's concept of "self" is not human-centric; it applies to any subjective being with agency, including potential aliens or artificial intelligences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>. Crucially, he posits that "choice has self," rather than "self has choice," suggesting choice is more fundamental than the notion of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:46]</a>.

In the context of ethics, a key distinction is made between perception and expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a>:
*   **Perception**: The flow of information from the world to the self; it is always private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.
*   **Expression**: The flow of information from the self to the world; it is always public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>.

According to Landry's framework, one can only be responsible for the totality of their choices and expressions, not for their perceptions or internal knowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>. This means "thought crime" should not be considered unethical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:19">[01:26:19]</a>. Judging another person's ethics is inherently unethical, as one cannot know their subjective processes or the full context of their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Communication Principles

For ethical communication, Landry proposes three essential "rights" that participants must freely grant to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:57">[01:26:57]</a>:
1.  **The right to speak**: Allowing others the freedom to express themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>.
2.  **The right to be understood**: Aiming for clarity and accurate reception of messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:39">[01:27:39]</a>.
3.  **The right to know that one has been understood**: Providing feedback to confirm message reception and comprehension, enabling error correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>.

When these principles are upheld, communication becomes possible and allows for the emergence of "larger reason" or connectivity that transcends individual minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:22">[01:29:22]</a>. This aligns with "mistake theory" in conflict resolution, where participants cooperatively seek to understand and correct errors, rather than dominate or control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>. This contrasts sharply with current [[challenges_of_modern_communication_and_truth_verification | challenges of modern communication and truth verification]] where assumptions of ill intent often prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>.

## Want, Need, and Desire in Relationships

Landry distinguishes between three aspects of human motivation and satisfaction:
*   **Want**: Satisfied externally, like wanting a candy bar (requires external acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.
*   **Need**: Satisfied internally, like needing food (requires internal processing like digestion for energy and growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:28">[01:36:28]</a>.
*   **Desire**: Satisfied on the boundary between internal and external, in relationship (e.g., the shared understanding of a word or mutual romantic feeling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial for effective personal choices, as seeking external satisfaction for an internal need, or vice-versa, leads to ineffectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>.

## Practical Implications for Humanity's Future

Landry criticizes academic approaches to ethics, such as "trolley problems," for being overly abstract and disconnected from the real-time, embodied choices people make under uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:11]</a>. He emphasizes that making good choices requires engaging with both feeling and thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a>.

The [[role_of_ethics_in_societal_and_technological_evolution | role of ethics in societal and technological evolution]] is becoming increasingly vital. With new technological powers, the [[ethics_practices_and_the_future_trajectory_of_humanity | ethics practices and the future trajectory of humanity]] depends on individuals and communities making increasingly better choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a>. The principles of ethics guide how humanity can achieve a "right relationship" with the natural world and other people, not just as individuals but as entire nations and the whole planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:17">[01:42:17]</a>.

[[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | Relevance realization]] is a core concept in [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | cognitive science]] that addresses how living agents effectively navigate and make sense of an overwhelmingly complex world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. It posits that meaning is not simply found in the world or imposed by the individual, but rather cultivated through an ongoing, transactive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

## Addressing the Combinatorial Explosion

The concept of [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | relevance realization]] emerges from a critique of earlier ideas in [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | cognitive science]], particularly the "erroneous thought" of Newell and Simon, who believed that all problems are fundamentally the same kind of well-defined problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. This perspective overlooks the "combinatorial explosion" of potential information and inferences that agents face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

Instead of a single general problem-solving algorithm, as Newell and Simon sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, most real-world problems are "ill-defined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>, such as how to educate a child to be a useful and happy adult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. The ability to find and formulate problems in an insightful way is a significant part of human intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

## Mechanism over Algorithm

[[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | Relevance realization]] operates as a mechanism, not an algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. This distinction is crucial because an algorithm relies on an essence or fixed definition, which [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | relevance realization]] lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

Much like Darwin's theory of adaptation, which describes a dynamical system where adaptivity is constantly being remade rather than fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>, [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | relevance realization]] describes a process in the brain analogous to evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. This process involves variation, selection, and regeneration to ensure the brain is "cognitively fitted" to its ever-changing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. This aligns with the "no free lunch theorem," which mathematically proves that no single general problem-solver can exist for all problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

## Embodied and Embedded Nature

[[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | Relevance realization]] is described as an embodied and embedded dynamical system operating below the propositional level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. It is grounded in an economic/pragmatic model, considering limitations of time and processing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. This "bioeconomic" level is evident in processes like arousal, which is calibrated by the autonomic nervous system's sympathetic and parasympathetic biases, constantly pushing and pulling to maintain dynamic stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

This affective ladenness means that every act of [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | relevance realization]] is intertwined with "caring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>, as individuals "pay attention" by investing their "cognitive coinage" in particular aspects of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.

## Intelligence and Attention

[[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | Relevance realization]] is considered the underlying engine that supports general intelligence (G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. While G is a powerful predictor of many life dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>, measures of G are not predictive of performance on tasks involving reasoning or rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. Rationality is viewed as a higher-order recursive enhancement of our abilities, specifically improving our [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | relevance realization]] machinery to track truth more closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.

[[role_of_attention_in_learning_and_cognition | Attention]] is deeply connected to [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | relevance realization]], functioning as the process of prioritizing signals, being both bottom-up and top-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

## Phenomenology of Relevance Realization: Religio and Spirituality

A challenging but pivotal discussion links [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | relevance realization]] to the notion of spirituality and "religio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. The argument is that [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | relevance realization]] can explain key features often associated with spirituality:
*   **Self-transcendence**: The capacity for qualitative development and moments of insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:58:59]</a>.
*   **Deep connectedness**: The dynamic coupling of the agent to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>.
*   **Primordiality and Mystery**: [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | Relevance realization]] is deeper than conceptual or propositional thought, prior to beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. It's a "phenomenological mystery" because one cannot step outside of it to observe it directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.
*   **Affordance of Wisdom and Self-deception**: It provides access to wisdom but can also drive self-deception <a class="yt-58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.

This integrated experience, which provides a sense of purpose, depth, coherence, and mattering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>, is termed "religio" – meaning "binding" – and is seen as the underlying functionality that traditional religion historically provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. It's considered "transjective," meaning it's neither purely subjective nor objective, but rather relates them and makes them both possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### The "Three Ns" of Stability
Christianity, during the Axial Age, provided a powerful Augustinian sense of stability through three "Ns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>:
*   **Narrative Order**: The sense that one's personal story fits within a larger cosmic narrative, providing purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>.
*   **Normative Order**: An account of how self-transcendence is possible, enabling individuals to improve and become "more real," contributing to a sense of depth or significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>.
*   **Nomological Order**: A meta-meaning system that makes the world intelligible and coherent, providing a sense of meaning in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>.

These three orders, collectively, contribute to a sense of "mattering," connecting the individual to themselves, the world, and other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

## Symbols and Sacredness

Symbols are not mere signs but rich metaphors that provoke insight by altering the "salience landscaping" of something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>. They allow us to hold in mind complex, incohate concepts like "justice" by re-engaging deep cognitive machinery, such as the cerebellum-frontal cortex loop for balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:39">[01:35:39]</a>. This "enacted metaphor" triggers machinery, enabling both practice and reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:22">[01:36:22]</a>.

However, symbols are also inherently dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:02">[01:37:02]</a>. The distinction between "sacredness" and "the sacred" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>:
*   **Sacredness**: Refers to the psycho-existential experience – the process of sense-making, realization, and transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>.
*   **The Sacred**: Refers to the metaphysical proposal about what *causes* this experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>.

The goal is to understand the phenomenology and functionality of sacredness independently of specific metaphysical claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>. The experience of sacredness can be described as a state of awe, a "sense of the really real" that is auto-normative, calling for self-transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>.

## Cultivation of Meaning and the Future

Nietzsche's proclamation of "God is dead" signified the end of the viability of the Axial Age worldview, leaving a void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>. Pseudo-religious movements like Nazism and Marxism, and even contemporary hyper-politicization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>, arose to fill this void by elevating propositions and ideologies over deeper meaning-making machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Rather than trying to *find* or *impose* meaning, the emphasis is on "meaning cultivation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. This metaphor suggests an active role in fostering meaning while also responding to processes outside of oneself, akin to cultivating a plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. This approach transcends both empiricism (blank slate) and romanticism (empty canvas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

Psychotechnologies, such as literacy or mindfulness practices, can profoundly alter the parameters of [[relevance_realization_and_cognitive_science | relevance realization]], leading to self-transcendence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>. The idea of a "religion that's not a religion" is proposed as a project to deeply understand "religio" and develop ecologies of practices to enhance it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>, aiming to do better than past traditions in addressing the modern meaning crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>.

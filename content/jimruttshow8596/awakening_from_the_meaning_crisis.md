*Awakening from the Meaning Crisis* is a video series by John Vervaeke, an Associate Professor of Psychology and Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This series explores key concepts in psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy to address the contemporary [[meaning_crisis_and_awakening | meaning crisis and awakening]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Core Concepts Explored

### Relevance Realization
Relevance is not something with a fixed "essence" in the Aristotelian sense, meaning it doesn't have a set of necessary and sufficient conditions shared by all its instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Instead, relevance is fundamentally a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. John Vervaeke argues that it is analogous to Darwinian "fittedness" or fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Just as fitness constantly redefines and redesigns itself through evolution by natural selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, relevance realization is a universal process that continually evolves and helps make sense of a combinatorially explosive and constantly changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Sacredness
Vervaeke defines sacredness not in a traditional metaphysical sense, but phenomenologically as the "inexhaustibility of our reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. It is experienced as a profound enhancement of one's [[the_meaning_crisis_and_meaning_in_life | meaning in life]] and connectedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This concept aligns with the Neoplatonic Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition's notion of *epictasis*, where God is seen as the ongoing affordance of continual self-transcendence rather than a static state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. When something affords an ongoing fount of new intelligibility and reciprocal opening, it tends to be experienced as more meaningful, transformative, and spiritually deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Symbols
Symbols, such as the Christian cross or the American flag, are understood in a rich, literary sense rather than just Peirce's icon-index-symbol distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. These "heavy symbols" are culturally and cognitively indispensable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. They are crucial for cognitive agency, much like a language is indispensable to a speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. However, their indispensability does not imply metaphysical necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. It is a common human tendency to conflate culturally useful symbols with metaphysically true claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### Religio and the Perennial Problems
Vervaeke defines *religio* as the realization (both awareness and actualization) of the fundamental connectedness that is at the core of our cognitive agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. This connectedness extends to ourselves, to others as sociocultural beings, and to the world as dynamically evolving cognitive systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

Religio is a significant part of the answer to the "perennial problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. These problems are inherent vulnerabilities that arise from the very processes that make humans adaptively fitted to their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Modal Confusion:** Confusing the "being mode" and "having mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.
*   **Absurdity:** The clash between personal and cosmic perspectives, leading to a sense of meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.
*   **Alienation:** The tension between individuation and participation in groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
*   **Parasitic Processing:** Tendencies towards self-deceptive and self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Reflectiveness Gap:** The challenge of balancing reflection and action, avoiding both impulsivity and Hamlet-like paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.
*   **Existential Entrapment:** Overcoming existential inertia and ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.

Humans are always "two steps from despair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>, constantly at risk of feeling disconnected from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. Religio, as a meta-meaningful system, aims to steer relevance realization away from foolishness and towards flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. This involves cultivating ecologies of practices that address these perennial problems and enhance connectedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

## The Religion That's Not a Religion (RTINAR)

The central proposal of the *Awakening from the Meaning Crisis* project is the "religion that's not a religion" (RTINAR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>. This is an "exactive proposal" to integrate the best cognitive science with the reverse-engineering of enlightenment, individually and collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. It seeks to draw from past ecologies and practices while leaving behind outdated "two worlds mythologies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. The aim is to create a worldview aligned with scientific understanding that ameliorates foolishness and affords flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.

### Religio, Credo, and Mythos

Within RTINAR, three concepts are critically re-evaluated:
1.  **Religio:** As defined above, the realization of fundamental connectedness, which is the primary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.
2.  **Credo:** The use of propositions and conceptual frameworks to set criteria, distinguish signal from noise, and determine what is "on the path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>. While cognitively indispensable for "signal detection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>, no particular credo is metaphysically necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>. Credo should always be in service of religio, constantly evolving and self-correcting like a dynamic system, rather than becoming a tyrannical, unchallengeable dogma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.
3.  **Mythos:** The use of symbols, stories, rituals, and celebrations to imaginally augment and make us aware of religio, enhancing its realization and wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. Mythos must also remain in service of religio and be wary of merging with credo, which can turn it into an unquestionable metaphysics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>. The *[[nietzsches_influence_and_the_meaning_crisis | Nietzsche's Influence and the Meaning Crisis]]* idea of the madman proclaiming "God is dead" means humanity must become worthy of creating new meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>, which involves collectively developing wisdom rather than relying on a single prophet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>.

## Reverse Engineering Enlightenment

Vervaeke proposes to "reverse engineer enlightenment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. Instead of seeking a mystical, elusive state described by historical accounts, the goal is to define enlightenment as reliably overcoming perennial problems and enhancing religio in a wise and transformatively effective way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. Using cognitive science, this approach aims to identify practices that systematically ameliorate problems and foster flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.

Practical approaches to addressing perennial problems include:
*   **Parasitic Processing:** Cultivating "counteractive dynamical systems" through ecologies of practices, such as a modified eightfold path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.
*   **Modal Confusion:** Engaging in practices like mindfulness to deeply remember the "being mode" distinct from the "having mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.
*   **Reflectiveness Gap:** Cultivating "flow states," as emphasized in Taoism, to achieve a comprehensive state of balanced engagement and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.
*   **Absurdity:** Using meditation and contemplation (like in Buddhism) to achieve non-dual states where clashing perspectives interpenetrate powerfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Existential Entrapment:** Engaging in "serious play," which involves imaginal augmentation of interaction with the world to drive transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>. Mindfulness practices are considered a species of serious play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.

## Cultivating Wisdom and Rationality

A key aspect of RTINAR is the cultivation of an ecology of psychotechnologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>. These are practices and tools (e.g., meditation, yoga, psychotherapy, psychedelic drugs, neurofeedback, group singing, ecstatic dancing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:45">[01:31:45]</a> that, when combined, offer complementary strengths and weaknesses, allowing for powerful opponent processing and self-correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>.

While intelligence (g) may be relatively fixed, rationality is highly malleable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>. There is much that can be done to ameliorate self-deceptive foolishness and improve connectedness to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>.

### Active Open-Mindedness
A crucial cognitive style for improving rationality is "active open-mindedness" (AOM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:54">[01:44:54]</a>. This practice, similar to Stoicism, involves:
1.  Identifying a cognitive bias and looking for it in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>.
2.  Turning those observation skills on oneself to catch personal instances of the bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:56">[01:45:56]</a>.
3.  Actively counteracting the bias, seeking disconfirming evidence, or asking others for criticisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:07">[01:46:07]</a>.
4.  Practicing "steel manning" — formulating the strongest possible version of an argument, especially one with which you disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:36">[01:47:36]</a>.
5.  Engaging in "dialogical movement," genuinely attempting to move one's own position towards the interlocutor's with integrity to encourage mutual movement and deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>.

This process fosters mutual self-correction, essential for democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:28:36]</a> and "real thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. The success of such a dialogue is not necessarily agreement, but for both participants to reach a place they couldn't have gotten to on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:09">[01:52:09]</a>. This focus on process over product is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.

By cultivating wisdom and virtue alongside rationality, and using meta-psychotechnologies responsibly, humanity can work towards a future of reduced foolishness and enhanced flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:37">[01:35:37]</a>. The goal is to make wise enlightenment possible for individuals and collectives, and to pursue it through continuous development and transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. The [[meaning_crisis_and_its_implications | meaning crisis and its implications]] and the [[meaning_crisis_and the_collapse_of_traditional_structures | collapse of traditional structures]] demand such an [[evolution_of_meaning | evolution of meaning]] and a collective, self-correcting approach to address the [[metacrisis_and_societal_challenges | metacrisis and societal challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>.

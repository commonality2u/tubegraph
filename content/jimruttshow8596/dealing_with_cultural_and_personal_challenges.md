Hanzi Freinacht, a philosopher and writer, is known as one of the main developers of the ideas of [[Metacrisis and societal challenges | metamodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. His work, including "The Listening Society" and "The Nordic Ideology," has significantly influenced the Game B community and the broader "liminal web of radical social changers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Freinacht's latest book, "12 Commandments for Extraordinary People to Master Ordinary Life," serves as a response to and engagement with Jordan Peterson's "12 Rules" books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## A Metamodern Response to Societal Issues

Freinacht's philosophical journey began in a postmodern sociology department, where he engaged with critical perspectives on power relations, language, and the social construction of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. While appreciating postmodernism's moral sensibilities, he sought to move beyond mere critique to constructive approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This led him to [[potential_solutions_to_cultural_drift | integral Theory]] and developmental psychology, which he combined with cultural analysis to form his vision of [[Metacrisis and societal challenges | metamodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The core idea is that for societies to be "sane" or "sustainable," they must support the inner growth of human beings, influencing personalities, relationships, goals, values, and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Freinacht views Jordan Peterson's work, which gained significant traction, as a "step back" to classical liberalism and conservatism, rather than a "step forward" into [[Metacrisis and societal challenges | metamodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Peterson's critique of [[critical_race_theory_and_cultural_issues | postmodernism]] was timely but lacked the progressive content and moral sensibilities necessary for true advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Freinacht aims to provide a [[Metacrisis and societal challenges | metamodern]] response, particularly in the realm of self-help, by baking in a different life philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This new approach offers a more "laid back" and hopeful vision, which is simultaneously "more secular and skeptical" and "more deeply spiritual or religious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### The "Meaning Crisis" and the Rejection of Two-World Thinking

A central theme in Freinacht's work is the rejection of a "two-world model," magic, and the supernatural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>. He aligns with what he calls "radical enlightenmentism," believing the world is "entirely devoid of all magic and all miracles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>. This stance addresses the "meaning crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>, acknowledging that relinquishing traditional supernatural beliefs can leave people feeling lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>.

However, Freinacht notes a paradox: magical thinking often appears *more* in highly developed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>. This occurs because direct phenomenological experiences (experiencing the world as richer, more whole, vibrant, and alive) can outpace cognitive capacities to explain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. This "gap" between rational and spiritual capacities is then filled with magical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. Conversely, if cognitive capacities exceed phenomenological experience, the world can feel "dead matter" or mundane, leading to reductionism and an anti-spiritual stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.

The solution lies in oscillating between these poles: skepticism (irony) and spiritual experience (sincerity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. This "metamodern sense" allows for the integration of both, eventually moving beyond mere oscillation into a "superposition where both are true simultaneously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:23">[01:25:23]</a>. The more rigorous one is in scientific scrutiny, the "farther you can safely travel into the magical realm and into spiritual experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>.

### Subjective States and Modern Challenges

Freinacht introduces the concept of "state" as a fundamental developmental dimension, referring to "first-person reality" or phenomenology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>. This encompasses the full range of human experience, from terror to intense beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>. He highlights "State 7" as the common experience in modern life: "you're okay... but there's a little tension in your back, there's a little worry in your mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>. He contrasts this with "State 8," a genuine sense of "okayness" and feeling "at home," which he posits was more common in pre-civilized societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.

> [!NOTE] State 7 vs. State 8
> The tendency to remain in State 7 (a pervasive sense of slight unease) in modern, late-stage Game A society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a> is a significant challenge. Freinacht argues that mastering one's own subjective states becomes paramount as global pressures (complexity, geopolitical shifts, climate change, demographic crunch) increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>.

Becoming masters of subjective states is crucial for personal and social resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>. This allows individuals, especially those in the "transnational creative class" or "Triple H population (hippies, hipsters, and hackers)," to respond more productively to challenges and avoid making things worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>.

## The 12 Commandments: A Guide to Metamodern Living

Freinacht's "12 Commandments" offer practical guidance for "extraordinary people to master ordinary lives," emphasizing "sober radical" living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.

### 1. Live in a Mess Moderately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>
This commandment directly challenges Peterson's "clean your room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. Freinacht argues that one doesn't owe a neat home or a perfectly ordered life to society to contribute valuably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. He critiques "individualist reductionism," where societal issues are incorrectly framed as purely individual responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. While personal responsibility is important, true societal change may require addressing systemic issues rather than simply cleaning one's room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.

### 2. Fuck Like a Beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>
This command, linked to "cosmo-eroticism," is about reconnecting to one's body and animal nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. It emphasizes getting over inhibitions, often by addressing traumas and emotional blockages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. By successfully processing pain and emotional discomfort, individuals can unlock a deeper sense of aliveness, enabling them to "speak without inhibition," "think without inhibition," and live more passionately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. This process of facing and resolving difficulties leads to greater freedom and an improved subjective state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.

### 3. Live Sincerely Ironically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>
This concept is central to [[Metacrisis and societal challenges | metamodernism]], integrating scientific skepticism (irony) with spiritual experience (sincerity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. Irony allows for holding multiple stances and being aware of the hypothetical nature of reality, preventing rigid adherence to beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. However, sincerity without irony can lead to "hysteria" or cult-like behavior, as seen with figures like Ken Wilber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. True sincerity requires being "ironic enough to check your facts" and acknowledge the possibility of being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>. Developing "intelligent defenses" or a well-thought-out stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a> allows for greater authenticity and expression, as one is less afraid of criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

### 4. Quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>
This commandment challenges the cultural norm that valorizes persistence above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. Freinacht argues that the ability to quit is the "basis of freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>. Knowing one *can* quit means choices (relationships, projects, habits) are truly chosen, leading to greater engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>. While quitting in personal relationships should be approached carefully, practicing the skill of quitting less important things builds the courage and understanding necessary to make significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. Quitting frees up time and energy, allowing for new opportunities and more optimized paths that align with one's evolving self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.

### 5. Do the Walk of Shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>
This refers to an internal "walk through your own gallery of shameful memories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>. Shame is an inhibitory feeling that "locks you down" and "paralyzes your body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>. By taking an inventory of these memories and "feeling through the shame until you get used to it," one can release its grip and unlock aliveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. This process allows for re-evaluating past experiences, recognizing when shame was unwarranted (e.g., violating an "idiotic" local convention) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>. A similar process applies to guilt, though guilt often requires deeper digging due to our tendency to "trick ourselves that we weren't actually guilty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.

### 6. Sacrifice Immortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>
This commandment addresses the fear of death, which Freinacht believes is a deeply ingrained and often inescapable aspect of the [[Human Nature and Societal Challenges | human mind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. It links this fear to the historical stages of religious and cultural development, where concepts of hell and eternal damnation were universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. Even with secularization, a "slight risk" or lingering background fear can remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>.
The concept of "reverse death therapy" is also introduced: instead of pondering what you would lose, consider what would be left of you if you lost your gifts and successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>. This practice, along with overcoming the "slave morality" that can lead to being ashamed of one's strengths, virtues, and talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>, helps unblock inner potential.

### 7. Heal with Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>
This is a pivotal commandment, linking inner personal healing with social justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>. Freinacht argues that personal growth and addressing internal blockages (shame, guilt, fear) are prerequisites for becoming a "righteous rebel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. Justice, in this context, means "wholeness" and ensuring "social relations are put into proportion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>. When social relationships are asymmetrical or based on false premises, they cause hurt and inhibit aliveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>.

Healing with justice involves aligning words, actions, perceptions, and emotions in transpersonal space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a>. The world is full of "disalignments" and "cracks in social reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>. To heal the world is to fight for justice, which provides a "true north" that transcends specific political systems or group conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>. This aligns with Carl Rogers' concept of "congruence," where deep values are lived, not just held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>. The main problem with much social justice today is hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>; Freinacht aims to create a basis for "non-hypocritical social justice from within" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>. A useful "tell" for injustice is the overuse of adjectives in discourse, as solid arguments require less linguistic manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>.

### 8. Burn Your Maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:39">[01:28:39]</a>
"Maps" refer to one's fundamental worldview or cognitive schema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>. We all operate with limited maps, and there's a human tendency to believe one's own map is the "best possible map," which is "exceedingly unlikely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>. This commandment encourages actively challenging and refactoring one's worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:17">[01:31:17]</a>. Not burning one's map can lead to investing decades in a flawed understanding of the world, potentially causing harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>.

By addressing inner blockages, individuals gain "inner spaciousness" to hold their maps less "hysterically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>, allowing them to "sincerely ironically imagine other possible worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>. This active process of seeking new perspectives and being open to being surprised, particularly by those very different from oneself, is crucial for continuous growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:08">[01:33:08]</a>.

### 9. Kill Your Guru and Find Your Others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:29">[01:36:29]</a>
This commandment criticizes the "guru game," where individuals seek "secret knowledge" from a single authority figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:39">[01:36:39]</a>. Freinacht suggests that excessive devotion to one guru, like Jordan Peterson, indicates being "Guru enthralled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:59">[01:37:59]</a>. While learning from others is valuable, triangulating different perspectives is more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>. Following a guru can be a form of "pseudo participation," where one looks to someone else's actions rather than deeply engaging in one's own life and unique gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>.

Instead of seeking gurus, the emphasis is on finding "others" – loyal friends and collaborators "on the same wavelength" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:08">[01:42:08]</a>. Unlike gurus, who sell themselves, friends must be "created" and maintained through relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:16">[01:42:16]</a>. This collaborative approach fosters exponential power, as it leverages diverse skill sets and promotes true [[role_of_culture_and_identity_in_societal_success | coherence]] within a team, avoiding the pitfalls of hierarchical worship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a>.

### 10. Play for Forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:45">[01:43:45]</a>
This final commandment is the culmination of the book's arc, bringing the individual home to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:04">[01:51:04]</a>. It's not about being forced to forgive, especially in situations of ongoing harm, but rather to "play for forgiveness" as the ultimate "measure of success" and conclusion to life's story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:32">[01:45:32]</a>. Forgiveness, in this context, means that a past event "no longer has a grip on your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:22">[01:46:22]</a>.

> [!INFO] Forgiving the World
> An accomplished life involves forgiving the world for its imperfections, unfairness, and difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:34">[01:46:34]</a>. Holding resentment against reality, creation, or God, is a futile fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:18">[01:47:18]</a>. This is framed as "reverse Christianity": instead of God forgiving our sins, we should forgive God (or the highest principle/totality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>. The more capable we are of forgiving reality, the more "peace of mind" and "higher goal for the soul" we achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:15">[01:48:15]</a>. The chapter breaks down forgiveness into sub-steps, starting with self-forgiveness and progressing through forgiving situations, honest mistakes, and finally malicious acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:19">[01:49:19]</a>. The ultimate step is to realize "there is nothing to forgive," seeing a "primordial wholeness" where things simply played out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>. Living a life where one can truly forgive leads to coming "home to this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:04">[01:51:04]</a>.

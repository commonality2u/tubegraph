Decentralized governance plays a critical role in the [[evolution_of_ai_and_societal_impacts | evolution of AI and societal impacts]], particularly through the development of [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | decentralized networks for AI]]. Tui Saliba, co-founder and CEO of [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]], and Global Chair for Internet Protocols for AI Security at IEEE, is actively involved in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The TOA IP Protocol and Hypercycle

[[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]] focuses on building [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | decentralized networks for AI]] communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. At its core is the TOA IP protocol, co-authored by Tui Saliba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This protocol was developed to eliminate the dependency on third parties in communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Communication of Value
TOA IP enables communication of "value" between two devices, crucial for AI agents that require sub-second responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Unlike traditional financial systems (banks, ledger-based blockchains, or Visa), which introduce delays (e.g., Bitcoin transactions take 10 minutes, Visa 200+ milliseconds round trip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, AI agents operate with time constraints of 100 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Furthermore, the cost of traditional transactions makes micro-payments for AI services impractical (e.g., 0.01 cent per page translation vs. 25 cents for Visa or high blockchain fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. TOA IP eliminates this friction by embedding cryptographic proof within the first network packet during a handshake, allowing for instantaneous verification and transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

This system is a "ledger-less blockchain," where events are proven to have happened in a block of time and then move to the next block, without a traditional ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Each "container" (called `hypc`) has a globally unique number using an Earth 64 data structure, making double spending impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

### Onboarding and Offboarding Value
Value, such as US Dollars or Bitcoin, can be onboarded into the [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]] network using Ledger-based blockchains like Ethereum for stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. The `hypc` container carries cryptographic proof of ownership for fractions of a cent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Once inside, these micro-payments are peer-to-peer, inexpensive, and fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

To "cash out" from the system, a decentralized smart contract called `chpc` acts as a bridge, costing about $1-2 per transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. This means that while micro-transactions within the AI network are extremely cheap and fast, interaction with human-centric payment systems still incurs traditional costs and delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

The focus is on AI-to-AI transactions because humans are too slow for the required sub-second responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. For example, Coinbase has a transaction machine (TM) for [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]] computation nodes to facilitate USDC transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

### Strategic Focus on AI
[[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]] deliberately focuses on AI compute rather than simple, rudimentary tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. This strategic decision avoids conflict with existing banks and blockchain companies, turning potential "enemies" into "partners" by creating a new, undisputed "AI territory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

## Wealth Creation at the Node Level
A key impact of [[decentralized_systems_as_an_alternative_to_centralized_systems | decentralized systems as an alternative to centralized systems]] is the introduction of wealth creation at the individual node level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. Business owners often miss the "balance sheet" value created by their improved operations, focusing only on "operating statement" profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]] enables AI nodes to appreciate in value over time, allowing the node operator to retain this wealth creation, rather than it leaking to centralized entities like AWS or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

Operators can purchase "node factories" (e.g., for $1,000, allowing for 1,024 nodes) which provide an independent business model generating revenue and wealth over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>. This incentivizes developers to join the network and contribute to its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

It's important to clarify that the market is for "results" or "services," not just raw compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. For example, an AI agent could provide highly accurate Italian-to-English translation services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. The value lies in the intellectual property and the quality of the service, which appreciates over time and can be replicated across many nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

## Decentralized AGI Development
The goal is to facilitate the development of AGI outside the control of large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. By enabling AI agents to quickly and cheaply ask other agents for specialized services (e.g., OCR, voice recognition), the network becomes a powerful collective intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.

This approach counters the risk of a single entity controlling AGI. A decentralized AGI ensures that the entire world "owns" it, rather than one organization, preventing potentially unethical or harmful directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. The decentralized governance model, while not democratic, prevents any single side from pulling the AGI in its own direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.

For example, a decentralized AGI could comprise components owned by different nations or entities (e.g., Chinese image interpretation, American perceptual systems, German translators), inherently building a decentralized structure akin to a human body with diverse, specialized parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

Tui Saliba is optimistic that [[decentralized_systems_as_an_alternative_to_centralized_systems | decentralized AI]] will reach AGI before centralized counterparts, citing the speed of network progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. He believes the "Trojan Horse" for decentralized AI is providing tangible value to every AI developer, incentivizing them to join the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Even large companies like Microsoft, with their 160,000 nodes, can become part of this [[decentralized_systems_as_an_alternative_to_centralized_systems | decentralized AI]] ecosystem if it helps them operate faster and make more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.

## Relationship with SingularityNET
[[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]] and [[singularitynet_and_its_decentralized_ai_economy | SingularityNET]] are not competitive but complementary. [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]] focuses purely on the network layer and its nodes, while [[singularitynet_and_its_decentralized_ai_economy | SingularityNET]] focuses on the AI operating system and AI nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>.

[[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]] provides the secure network that allows any AI agent to talk to any other agent, regardless of whether they are inside Microsoft, Google, TenCent, or [[singularitynet_and_its_decentralized_ai_economy | SingularityNET]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>. This creates an interoperating network for different clusters of AI that can safely call each other and receive secure compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

### Becoming a Hypercycle Developer
Developers can get involved with [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]] either by investing capital (buying nodes) or acquiring knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. The documentation, including core whitepapers, is available on hypercycle.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. The system primarily uses Python for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>. People can learn to run their own nodes through hackathons, often within three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.

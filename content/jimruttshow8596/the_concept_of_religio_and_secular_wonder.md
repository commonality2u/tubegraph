## Introduction to Religio

The term "Religio" is used to describe the underlying, primal functionality pointed to by spirituality, distinct from specific religious creeds or metaphysical claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. It is viewed as deeper than conceptual, normative, or experiential understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. The choice of the term "Religio" is deliberate, reflecting its etymological origin meaning "binding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. This focus on binding captures the idea of how individuals are integrally connected to themselves, their bodies, and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.

John Vervaeke's use of "religio" aims to capture the deep functionality of what was previously sought in religion, particularly in response to the "God is dead" proclamation by Nietzsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This perspective suggests that phenomena like sacredness were always fundamentally about these binding and meaning-making processes, rather than exclusively about supernatural or divine beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.

### Components of Religio

Religio, as an underlying process, encompasses several core features often associated with spirituality:
*   **Primordiality** It is deeper than the conceptual and pre-conceptual, prior to beliefs and propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, making it phenomenologically mysterious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.
*   **Transactivity** It refers to the dynamic coupling of an individual with the world, leading to a sense of connectedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>.
*   **Self-Transcendence** This refers to the human capacity for growth and qualitative development, leading to moments of insight and deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
*   **Saffiential Dimensions** Religio affords both the cultivation of wisdom and the potential for self-deception and foolishness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
*   **Mattering** It fundamentally connects an individual to themselves, the world, and other people, contributing to a sense of purpose, depth, and coherence in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

Religio is closely tied to the concept of [[relevance_realization | relevance realization]], which is seen as the underlying mechanism for making sense of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. The processes of [[relevance_realization | relevance realization]] generate and imply the features associated with religio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. The emphasis on religio reflects a move away from reducing religious experience solely to propositional beliefs (credo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>.

## Secular Wonder

Secular wonder, as articulated by Paul Cilliers, describes how our sense of meaningfulness functions as an atmosphere rather than a discrete object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. We exist within this atmosphere, breathing and being shaped by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. It refracts and patterns how light is perceived, influencing our perception of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>.

We become aware of this atmospheric meaningfulness not through focal cognition, but through states like moods or wonder itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>. Wonder is distinct from curiosity; it's a "how does this all hang together" question, an attempt to appreciate the process by which things become meaningful without necessarily expecting a definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. It is an "atmospheric attempt to jump outside" of our [[relevance_realization | relevance realization]] machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.

Secular wonder represents a process of "transframing," where an individual opens up their agent-arena relationship, realizing that both they and the world could be more and fit together in previously unrealized ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>. This opening can escalate from wonder to awe, fostering a sense of continuous flow and transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>.

## The Role of Psychotechnologies and Symbols

The concept of religio is deeply intertwined with [[relevance_of_spirituality_and_altered_states_in_metamodernism | psychotechnologies]] â€“ practices that significantly alter the parameters of [[relevance_realization | relevance realization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>. Just as literacy profoundly affects cognitive abilities, psychotechnologies like mindfulness practice, mystical experiences, or psychedelics can impact this [[relevance_realization | relevance realization]] flow state, potentially nudging general intelligence and enhancing the experience of religio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.

Rich symbols play a crucial role in both secular wonder and religio. Unlike simple signs, these symbols are "metaphors that allow us to hold something in mind... that can't otherwise be held in mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>. They provoke insight by altering our "salience landscaping," making certain features more prominent (e.g., "Sam is a pig" highlights certain characteristics of Sam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>.

Symbols like the scales of justice or the American flag not only represent abstract concepts but also re-engage and "exapt" underlying cognitive machinery, allowing for a deeper, more engaged relationship with that concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>. However, this power also carries danger, as symbols can become idols when their "translucency" is lost, leading to reactive, foolish participation rather than wise engagement (e.g., the crusades and the cross) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:20">[01:39:20]</a>.

## The Need for a New Framework

The meaning crisis, intensified by the failure of pseudo-religious ideologies like Nazism and Marxism, highlights the need for new ways to cultivate meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Traditional models, like the Augustinian framework of narrative, normative, and nomological order, provided stability and meaning for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. While effective, they cannot be simply replicated in a world that has moved beyond their underlying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

The concept of religio and secular wonder, therefore, offers a path forward: to understand and cultivate the deep, pre-conceptual, and affective processes of meaning-making that historically underpin what we call spirituality and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:39">[01:29:39]</a>. This endeavor aims to provide a robust framework for meaning that is adaptable to modern challenges, similar to the goal of the [[the_concept_of_a_religion_that_is_not_a_religion | religion that's not a religion]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>. This modern approach seeks to move beyond the limitations of the Enlightenment's focus solely on objective knowledge, recognizing the vital importance of meaning and purpose that it overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>.

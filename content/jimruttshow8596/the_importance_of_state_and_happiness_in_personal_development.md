In the context of personal development, the concept of "state" is crucial for understanding an individual's [[human_performance_and_flow_states | subjective experience]] and overall well-being. This discussion delves into what "state" means, its varying levels, and its significance for personal growth and societal resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Defining "State"
"State" refers to direct phenomenology, which is the first-person reality as it appears through one's own eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. It encompasses the rich tapestry of sensory experiences, feelings, and overall existential quality of being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. This means perceiving and feeling the world more directly and vibrantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## Levels of State
Subjective states can range from very low to very high:
*   **Low States** Can involve experiences of "sheer terror" or feeling "stuck in a loop," akin to a "dark hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
*   **Medium States (State 7)** This is described as the typical "okay, sort of" state for most people in modern everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. It often involves a subtle underlying tension, worry, or uneasiness, where one doesn't feel entirely at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>. Many may wonder why life seems easier for others who appear more "in the [[importance_of_flow_states_and_mindfulness | flow]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Medium-High States (State 8)** This is the "genuinely okay" state, characterized by a sense of safety and contentedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. While not necessarily ecstatic, life feels "fresh and alive," and one feels at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. Children often experience this state more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **High States** These go beyond everyday life, offering experiences of greater wholeness, directness, and vibrancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Individuals may feel part of a "huge cosmic expanse," conscious, and capable of love, with a sense that "everything is going to be all right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. These can include moments of intense beauty and mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## Societal Impact on States
The prevalence of "State 7" in contemporary society is linked to the complexities of modern civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. The mounting complexity of lives, the deluge of information, and the various geopolitical and demographic pressures contribute to a general decline in subjective states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. In contrast, pre-civilized or Stone Age societies may have made it easier to be in "State 8" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

## Mastering Subjective States
It is increasingly vital for individuals to become "masters of our own subjective states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. This mastery leads to:
*   **Increased Social Resilience:** The ability to remain in higher states helps people maintain composure and effectiveness amidst challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
*   **Productive Responses to Challenges:** Individuals are more likely to respond energetically and less likely to overreact or fall prey to "crazy schemes" like conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **Better Decision-Making:** A clearer mind, stemming from a better state, helps prevent actions that could inadvertently worsen situations in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.

The book *12 Commandments for Extraordinary People to Master Ordinary Life* aims to provide clarity for achieving "State 8" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>. It advocates for an "embodied life philosophy" that supports radical thinking while maintaining sobriety, creating "sober radical people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## State, Rationality, and Spirituality
A deeper understanding of state involves recognizing a potential gap between rational capacities and spiritual or phenomenological capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   When phenomenological senses (e.g., sense of enchantment) exceed cognitive models, the gap can be filled with "magical thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
*   Conversely, when cognitive models outpace phenomenological senses, the world can feel "dead matter" or mundane, leading to reductionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

The goal is to learn to oscillate between "skepticism" (irony) and "magical belief" (sincerity/religious experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Eventually, this oscillation can lead to a "superposition where both are true simultaneously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. From this [[higher_states_of_consciousness_and_their_perception_as_more_real | higher state]], a "ruthless scientific scrutiny of reality" can allow one to "safely travel into the magical realm and into spiritual experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>, leading to greater understanding and intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

## Personal Development and Inner Growth
The book also touches on the importance of inner growth, emphasizing that society needs to become "much better at supporting the inner growth of human beings as personalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This means optimizing for the growth of individuals, their relationships, goals, values, and even [[importance_of_institutions_in_society | institutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

The concept of "[[metamodern_selfhelp_philosophy | sincere irony]]" is presented as a path to greater authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. True sincerity requires an ironic detachment, allowing one to "check your facts" and "leave a certain amount of doubt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. This fosters a relaxed and real expression of thoughts, without defensiveness, akin to a well-defended country having peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>.

The ability to "quit" things that are no longer serving one's best interests is also presented as a path to freedom and greater energy application, allowing for continuous optimization of oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>. Similarly, "doing the walk of shame" (confronting personal shameful memories) and "healing with [[navigating_social_justice_and_personal_integrity | justice]]" (aligning words, actions, perceptions, and emotions) contribute to personal wholeness and a genuine compass for social action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.

Ultimately, an "accomplished life" is one where we forgive the world for its imperfections, moving from resentment to care and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:38">[01:46:38]</a>. This final step of "playing for forgiveness" ensures that our actions stem from a place of genuine connection rather than unhealed grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

The concept of [[Hierarchical Complexity]] has been applied to various fields, including leadership development and business contexts, particularly through the work of Lectica, co-founded by Zach Stein and Theo Dawson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:20">[01:50:20]</a>. This application aims to understand and measure the cognitive complexity required for and demonstrated in various professional tasks, distinguishing between individual capacity and specific task performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.

## Hierarchical vs. Horizontal Complexity in Practice

[[Hierarchical Complexity]] (or vertical complexity) refers to tasks that are fundamentally and qualitatively more complex, demanding the integration of lower-order capacities into new, higher-order skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. In contrast, horizontal complexity involves doing more of the same task at the same level of complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

> [!example] Practical Examples
> *   **Horizontal Complexity:** Tying a thousand shoes, where the skill level for each shoe remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. Taking an elevator from the lobby to the seventh floor, which involves a sequence of discrete tasks at the same level of difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.
> *   **Hierarchical Complexity:** Making a shoe, which is qualitatively more complex than just tying one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. Disassembling, replacing a small part, and reassembling a lawnmower engine, where each move depends on previous ones and requires ancillary skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>.

## The Complexity Gap in Leadership

Leaders face increasingly complex task demands in their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. This can lead to a "complexity gap" between the demands of most [[Crisis Management and Decision Making | leadership]] roles and the actual capacities of the leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

Lectica's work, which began with [[Leadership Decision Making | leadership]] development in the intelligence community, found that struggles often emerged in domains of:
*   **Perspective-taking:** Imagining how others would react to a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.
*   **Perspective-seeking:** Actively seeking out the perspectives of employees or team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.
*   **Perspective-integration:** Synthesizing multiple perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>.

Often, individuals highly developed in one area of expertise might have a "complexity deficit" in others, or struggle to apply skills across different domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>. For example, a medical doctor, highly skilled in their field, might not be a good investor because the pattern-matching algorithms for medicine don't apply to the investment world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.

> [!info] Organizational Structure and Complexity
> The shift in management theories from rigid, hierarchical structures with small direct reports (e.g., 5-7) to flatter organizations with many more direct reports (e.g., 20) in the late 20th century likely put significant stress on leaders' capacity for perspective-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>. Processing the diverse perspectives of 20 direct reports is much more challenging than managing five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:53">[01:28:53]</a>. In a research lab with many PhDs, a narrower management span (e.g., one manager to four researchers) was found necessary due to the high complexity of individual reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:51">[01:30:51]</a>.

## Assessment and Development in Organizations

Lectica developed standardized, internet-administered developmental assessments to measure [[Hierarchical Complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. These assessments differ from traditional tests:
*   **Diagnostic vs. Pass/Fail:** Unlike standardized tests (e.g., SAT) that simply indicate pass or fail, Lectica's assessments provide diagnostic reports. They identify what a person understands and suggest the "next best thing" for them to learn, fostering continued growth in their [[Hierarchical Complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.
*   **Domain Specificity:** Assessments do not classify an entire person at a single level of [[Hierarchical Complexity]]. Instead, they assign a level to a *particular task* accomplished by that person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. This means an individual might demonstrate paradigmatic reasoning in physics but only sensory-motor skills in small engine repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.
*   **Focus on Development:** The primary value proposition of these assessments is to promote [[Leadership Decision Making | leadership]] development, rather than merely for hiring or firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. However, they can be used to set minimum complexity thresholds for job roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>.

> [!warning] Responsible Use of Assessments
> It is crucial to use psychological constructs and measures responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. Over-simplifying human psychology by classifying individuals or populations with a single number (like an IQ score) can lead to "demi-realities" and act as a social sorting mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. Measures should not be used as a "bludgeon," but rather to understand and support individual and organizational growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>. Lectica requires a certification process for users of its assessments to ensure appropriate and educational use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>.

In contexts such as leadership, [[Ethics in communication and relationships | ethical considerations]] are paramount. High-functioning individuals may possess advanced [[Hierarchical Complexity]] and perspective-taking skills but use them for strategic advantage or malicious intent, akin to a "Darth Vader move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:26">[01:32:26]</a>. This highlights that higher levels of cognitive complexity are not inherently "better" without accompanying ethical grounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:48">[01:32:48]</a>. The importance of absolute intellectual honesty in organizational culture can combat "bad faith game theoretic situations" and foster better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

From: [[jimruttshow8596]] <br/> 

[[metamodernism_and_political_metamodernism | Metamodernism]] is presented as the next step in philosophical development, evolving from and including [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society | postmodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. It proposes a framework for understanding and addressing complex societal [[challenges_in_applying_metamodernism_in_society | challenges]] by integrating various aspects of human development. Hansie Frýnet, a political philosopher, historian, sociologist, and author of *The Listening Society* and *The Nordic Ideology*, is a key thinker behind this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. His work is described as potentially being "the best stuff I've ever read on social change" or "a handbook for nineteen eighty-four plus plus," suggesting its radical and potentially risky implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Metamodernism's Relationship with Postmodernism

The discussion highlights a critical relationship between [[metamodernism_and_political_metamodernism | metamodernism]] and [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society | postmodernism]]. While [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society | postmodernism]] is often perceived as "crazy" and unproductive, particularly in its academic forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, Frýnet argues it is a very widespread "developmental stage" of both individuals and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. He estimates that 20-25% of the adult population in Western countries are [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society | postmodernists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

[[postmodernism_vs_metamodernism | Postmodernism]] emerged as a protest against the "callous cold empirical hand of the Enlightenment" and modernity's universal aspirations, aiming to redefine society through critiques and new perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. It functions as a "religion of critique," deeply influencing media and academia with its egalitarian, multi-perspectival, and relativistic sensibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Key contributions of [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society | postmodernism]] include discourse analysis and exposing power structures, highlighting how injustice harms human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

However, Frýnet contends that [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society | postmodernism]] lacks the "answers for the next stage of society," often leading to "dead ends" and "reactionary neo reactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. Its core lies in critique, not in providing a "to-do list" or the ability to make decisions for collective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:10:00">[49:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:41:00">[49:41:00]</a>.

[[metamodernism_and_political_metamodernism | Metamodernism]], in contrast, represents a "revolt against modernity" (because it's "not good enough") and also a "revolt against [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society | postmodernity]]" (because it's stagnant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. It proposes moving beyond the limitations of [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society | postmodernism]] by re-embracing "growth hierarchies" and empirically testable knowledge, which are anathema to the [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society | postmodern]] sensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## Philosophical Bases: The Affective Value Meme

A foundational building block in Frýnet's work is the **affective value meme** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. This concept suggests that there are "overarching deeper structures" in how values are generated and evolve within societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. For example, values in agricultural, tribal, and industrial societies differ significantly and logically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:25:00">[33:25:00]</a>.

Current modern values are adapted to an expanding industrial welfare state, while [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society | postmodern]] values critique it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>. However, these values are deemed "insufficient" for addressing today's more complex [[challenges_in_applying_metamodernism_in_society | challenges]], such as climate change, global governance, migration flows, and existential risks from technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>. This necessitates a "deliberate institutional change" to move people towards "meta modern value mean[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>.

The affective value meme is decomposed into four parts:

1.  **Model of Hierarchical Complexity**: This is a mathematically formulated theory of cognitive complexity stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>. It posits that there are distinct stages of thought processes, from simple to complex, which can be observed empirically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Abstract (Stage 10)**: Ability to reason about things not physically present, using abstract variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>. Most adults reach this stage by junior high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Formal Operations (Stage 11)**: Ability to formulate linear or nonlinear relationships between several abstract variables and test them mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>. This stage is sufficient for much of modern society's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. More than half of adults reach this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.
    *   **Systemic Reasoning (Stage 12)**: Ability to create and understand entire systems of formal relations, including feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:00">[30:14:00]</a>. Only about 20% of the adult population reaches this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>.
    *   **Meta-Systemic Reasoning (Stage 13)**: Involves seeing patterns *within* systems and comparing their different properties and logics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:42:00">[30:42:00]</a>. Approximately 1.8% of the population reaches this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:12:00">[54:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Paradigmatic (Stage 14)**: Mentioned as a stage beyond meta-systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>.

2.  **Code or Symbol Stage**: Refers to how culture itself evolves, embedding symbols or ideas of different complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:09:00">[33:09:00]</a>. These are non-arbitrarily ordered, meaning that different modern societies are more comparable to each other than to their own past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:18:00">[33:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>. The culture's code must be "downloaded" by individuals for them to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:14:00">[34:14:00]</a>.

3.  **Emotional State and Emotional Depth**: These are also considered dimensions of the affective value meme, adding subjective subtlety to human development and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:00">[38:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>.

## Spirituality and Consciousness in Metamodern Contexts

[[spirituality_and_consciousness_in_meta_modern_contexts | Spirituality]] is considered highly relevant to [[metamodernism_and_political_metamodernism | metamodernism]] because it taps into experiences of "wholeness, or love, or connection" that can deeply transform an individual's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. These experiences are linked to "higher subjective states" of awareness, which can lead to new conclusions about reality, and have historically driven [[philosophy_and_ethics_in_modern_society | philosophy]] and religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.

[[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | Metaphysics]] is brought into the discussion when considering whether [[spirituality_and_consciousness_in_meta_modern_contexts | spiritual]] experiences are reducible to objective physiological correlates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:08">[01:22:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>. Frýnet argues that while these experiences have physiological bases (e.g., neural firing and confabulation), this "doesn't take anything away from the depth" of the experience itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:54">[01:26:54]</a>.

[[metamodern_selfhelp | Metamodernism]] seeks to move beyond the "sins" of both "essentialism" (ascribing literal depth to phenomena like angels) and "reductionism" (disenchanting reality by explaining away all magic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:36">[01:20:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>. The ideal is a dynamic balance, allowing one to "take issues of [[spirituality_and_consciousness_in_meta_modern_contexts | spirituality]] seriously" and live a "life of faith" in a moral project, while still maintaining a critical mind and avoiding manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:35">[01:28:35]</a>. This means coordinating "crude reductionism" with "trembling [[spirituality_and_consciousness_in_meta_modern_contexts | spirituality]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:54">[01:29:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Direction

A significant [[challenges_in_applying_metamodernism_in_society | challenge in applying metamodernism]] is the limited percentage of the population (less than 2%) with the cognitive "hardware" for meta-systemic reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:00">[53:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:09:00">[53:09:00]</a>. When metamodern ideas are "flattened" for popular consumption, they can lead to pathologies like distorted interpretations of "growth hierarchies" or even fascism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:30:00">[55:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>.

Despite these risks, the need for [[metamodernism_and_political_metamodernism | metamodernism]] is underscored by the current societal trajectory towards a "self terminating curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:32:00">[58:32:00]</a>. The solution involves not necessarily popularizing the complex ideas to everyone, but focusing on influencing a few hundred key people who can commit to "serious change" and "affect the knowledge generation trajectories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. This approach aims to change institutions, political games, markets, and knowledge creation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.

The "yoga bourgeoisie," particularly those in Silicon Valley and Burning Man culture, are seen as a core population of early [[metamodern_selfhelp | metamodernists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:36">[01:32:36]</a>. These individuals have experienced modernity, found it insufficient, and turned to [[spirituality_and_consciousness_in_meta_modern_contexts | spiritual]] practices and self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:55">[01:32:55]</a>. They possess financial, business, and emotional capital, but often lack a "revolutionary faith" and the proper "meta modern code" or "map" to consciously change society's structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:05">[01:34:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:51">[01:34:51]</a>. The goal for [[metamodernism_and_political_metamodernism | metamodernism]] is to mobilize and radicalize this class to drive institutional and [[cultural_evolution_and_modernity | cultural evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:03">[01:36:03]</a>.

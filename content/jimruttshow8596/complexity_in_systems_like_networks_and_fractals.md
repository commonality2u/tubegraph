Measuring [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity]] is a difficult task, with many different approaches and measures available, each suited for particular applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>. When examining systems like networks and fractals, specific measures become particularly useful for understanding their intricate structures and behaviors.

## Fractal Dimensions

[[Complexity theory and systems thinking | Complex systems]] can be understood through the lens of nonlinear dynamical systems, which often include the study of fractals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. Fractals are patterns, like snowflakes, that are self-similar, meaning they look similar at different scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

A classic example is the weather, as studied by Ed Lorenz at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. Lorenz observed that weather equations were chaotic, where a tiny initial difference could lead to a large divergence later, making them intrinsically unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. However, this nonlinearity drives the dynamics to a "strange attractor," which is a fractal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. The confinement of weather dynamics to this strange attractor, despite its unpredictability, reveals a lot about its behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

While calculating the weather by tracking every atom is impossible, [[Complexity and complicated distinction | fractal structures]] at various scales allow for simulations and predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. This means complex systems, like the weather, are hard to predict, but not intrinsically unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

## Network Complexity

[[Complexity theory and systems thinking | Network complexity]] is a broad class of ideas for dealing with complex networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>. Examples include:
*   Communications networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>
*   Neural connections in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>
*   The power grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>

The structure of a network contributes to its [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. For instance, the power grid comprises diverse power plants (coal, nuclear, wind, solar) connected in varied ways, with electricity spread across long distances through different transmission lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. This intricate structure leads to dynamic and often unforeseen behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>.

Networks can enter chaotic regimes, which is undesirable for systems like the electrical grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. Efforts are made to tune them to non-chaotic regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>. However, when complex electromechanical systems are pushed to their limits, even small changes can lead to [[emergentism_and_complexity_science | emergent]], often unpleasant, behavior at the "edge of chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Research suggests that, given the fluctuations in demand and the grid's topology, arbitrary levels of failure, including complete collapse, are theoretically possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>.

## Multiscale Entropy

Related to [[complexity_theory_and_systems_thinking | complexity theory and systems thinking | coarse-graining]], multiscale entropy addresses how much information exists in a system at different scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. [[Complexity science and societal systems | Coarse-graining]] involves looking at a system at a particular scale, effectively discarding information below that scale (e.g., focusing on gas temperature and pressure, not individual molecule movements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

[[Emergence and complexity in biological systems | Complex systems]], by most definitions, typically contain significant amounts of information at each scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. Living systems serve as prime examples:
*   Humans exhibit macroscopic behaviors like conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.
*   At smaller scales, individual human cells are highly complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.
*   Even tiny mechanisms within a cell, such as mitochondria (involved in energy production), are extremely complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>.

Multiscale entropy quantifies this information across different scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>. Systems like networks or biological organisms display a large amount of multiscale information or entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. However, just like mutual information or integrated information, multiscale entropy is considered a *symptom* of [[complexity_theory_and_evolution_of_life | complexity]], rather than its sole cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. Simple fractals, for instance, can also possess high multiscale information without necessarily being considered very complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

Ultimately, there is no single, universal measure of [[complexity_theory_and_its_critiques | complexity]] that applies to all domains; rather, many different measures exist, and the most appropriate one depends on the specific context and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>.

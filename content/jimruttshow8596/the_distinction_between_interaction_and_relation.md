Forrest Landry's immanent philosophy distinguishes between "interaction" and "relation," two fundamental concepts that underpin his understanding of the universe and how knowledge is acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This distinction clarifies the nature of causality, knowledge, and even the universe itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

## Defining Relation

A "relation" is described as atemporal, meaning it has no temporal element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Mathematics is presented as the study of pure relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. If a mathematical proof is true, it "has always been true before I even knew that and it will remain true forevermore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a> (assuming no error in the proof) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. Mathematical structures do not require a concept of time for their conception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

## Defining Interaction

In contrast, "interaction" inherently possesses a temporal element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. It involves a "before" and "after" state, characteristic of processes like scientific experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Interaction signifies the moment when [[information is effectively flowing from the objective to the subjective]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. This concept implies:
*   Temporality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   Flow of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.
*   The existence of other possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.
*   Forces in time and probabilities over possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

These concepts allow for the construction of theories such as information theory, communication theory, measurement theory, signaling theory, and ideas of causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.

## The Role of the Observer in Interaction

The concept of an observer is implied in the notion of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. When one attempts to imagine "something," the imaginer (observer) is inherently involved in the act of imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. For Landry, the process of knowing is more fundamental than the being of the objective or subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. To establish if something exists, an interaction is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This means that interaction is, in some sense, more fundamental than the notion of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a> and even more fundamental than the notion of creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

## Interaction as a Fundamental Concept of the Universe

The universe can be understood as a concept that points to three other concepts: creation, existence, and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. Perfected knowledge of these three topics would yield perfected knowledge of the universe, as anything asserted about the universe is a subset or combination of knowledge about these three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.

On a conceptual level, to know anything about the nature of existence, one must depend upon the nature of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. Therefore, the "real" is reconciled in terms of the interaction rather than in terms of the things that are interacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.

## Connection to Process

Interaction can be conceived as being analogous to the "atomic constituents" of process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. The notion of interaction is treated as directly isomorphic with the notion of process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>. The component parts of interaction, while necessary and sufficient, cannot be "unsplitable" like quarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>.

The concept of process can be understood in terms of:
*   Patterns in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.
*   Force and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.
*   Probability and possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

Another way to understand process is through the lens of comparison, which involves subject, object, sameness, difference, [[Relationship between Context and Content in Perception | content and context]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. Regardless of how process is considered, these six sub-components are necessary and sufficient to reify the concept of process, interaction, or comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>.

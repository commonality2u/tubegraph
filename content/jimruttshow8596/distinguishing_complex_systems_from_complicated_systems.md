The [[complexity_science_and_its_implications | field of complexity science]] often distinguishes between [[complex_systems_and_their_properties | complex]] and complicated systems, a crucial differentiation for understanding how systems behave and how to manage them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The Cynefin framework, developed by Dave Snowden, categorizes systems as ordered, complex, and chaotic, with further division of ordered systems into "clear" and "complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Complicated Systems

A good way to understand complicated systems is to look at the etymology of the word:
*   The Latin root of "complicated" is "to unfold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Key characteristics of complicated systems include:
*   **Unfoldability** You can unfold something complicated, and it remains the same thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Deconstructible and Reconstructible** A complicated system can typically be taken apart and put back together again, because its logic is implicit in the static design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Predictability** Humans are generally adept at making things complicated to achieve predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Linear Material Causality** They typically exhibit linear material causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Boundaries** [[Reductionism vs complexity science | Systems thinking]], often associated with complicated systems, defines systems by boundaries, implying they are closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### Examples of Complicated Systems
*   A lawnmower motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   A Boeing 777 airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   An aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Complex Systems

Conversely, [[complex_systems_and_their_properties | complex systems]] are fundamentally different:
*   **Entangled** The Greek origin of "complex" means "entangled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Something that is entangled is constantly shifting and changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Irreconstructible** You cannot take a complex system apart and put it back together again and expect it to work the same way, because much of the information resides in its dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Non-linear Causality** In a [[complex_systems_and_the_emergence_of_order | complex adaptive system]], there is no linear material causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. While they have dispositionality and are modulated, they do not have causality in any meaningful sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. They do not have easily mapped causality, and even deterministic complex systems can pass through deterministic chaos where cause and effect are practically impossible to map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **[[emergence_in_complex_systems | Emergence]]** The properties of the whole are always different from the properties of the parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Discovering [[emergence_and_irreducibility_in_complex_systems | emergence]] is a key aspect of working with [[complexity_in_various_domains | complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Open Systems** Generally, [[complex_systems_and_their_properties | complex systems]] are open or at least semi-permeable to an outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. They deal with systems that have multiple connections by definition, making them open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. At the system level, they are not subject to the second law of Thermodynamics, though the overall system of systems might be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Managing Dispositionality** With a complex system, one cannot control the output or aim for a specific goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Instead, management focuses on describing the current state and identifying possible next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. One must start journeys with a sense of direction rather than fixed goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Influencing Emergence** By understanding and managing constraints and constructors (types of modulators), one can influence [[emergence_in_complex_systems | emergence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. If enough "magnets" (modulators) can be controlled with real-time feedback, it's possible to influence the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Examples of Complex Systems
*   Bramble bushes in a thicket, where everything is entangled, and unintended consequences are certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   A human cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   An economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   Mayonnaise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   Superconductors, where the emergent property cannot be predicted from individual electron behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   Human systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Implications for Management and Strategy

Misinterpreting a complex system as merely complicated can lead to radical errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For instance, assuming a system operates in the center of a Gaussian distribution (as with Six Sigma) when it actually operates in a power-law or fat-tail distribution (like a crisis) will lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Instead of traditional planning cycles (like Soviet Russia's five-year plans), [[complexity_science_in_organizational_context | complexity theory]] suggests mapping the present and identifying adjacent possibles â€“ where the system can go next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. This means shifting from outcome management to dispositional management, focusing on influencing the system's dispositionality so desired outcomes are more probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:41">[01:32:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.

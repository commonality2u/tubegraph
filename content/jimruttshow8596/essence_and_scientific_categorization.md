The notion of essence has become highly contentious in modern culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This stems from an overemphasis on an idea articulated by [[Wittgenstein]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Wittgenstein's Perspective

[[Wittgenstein]] observed that many human-formed categories lack an essence in the Aristotelian sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This means there isn't a set of necessary and sufficient conditions shared by all members of the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. His famous example is "game" â€“ no single set of conditions applies to all games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. While this insight is valuable, it has been overinterpreted in modern culture to suggest that nothing possesses an essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Quine's Counter-Argument and Scientific Essence

Philosopher Quine offered a counter-argument, suggesting that the primary task of [[Metaphysics and its relation to scientific concepts | science]] is precisely to discover those categories that *do* possess an essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

For Quine, an essence isn't something that can be defined *a priori* (before experience), except perhaps in mathematics, which is distinct from [[Metaphysics and its relation to scientific concepts | science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Mathematics operates as a closed system of axioms and mechanical manipulations, unlike empirical [[Metaphysics and its relation to scientific concepts | science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Quine argued that essences are categories that support the broadest possible explanatory generalizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. When [[Metaphysics and its relation to scientific concepts | science]] takes a sample, it looks for properties that generalize widely to the larger world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The more generalizable these properties are, the closer [[Metaphysics and its relation to scientific concepts | science]] gets to uncovering important aspects of the [[Existence and the Nature of Reality | nature of reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Example: Gold

Gold serves as a concrete example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Its atomic weight, density, and other properties remain constant regardless of where or when it is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This stability across contexts indicates an essential property.

### Systematic Import (J.S. Mill)

J.S. Mill introduced the concept of "systematic import" to differentiate between explanatory and non-explanatory generalizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

*   **Horses vs. White Things**:
    *   Learning about a particular *horse* provides knowledge that largely transfers to other horses, enabling generalizations for medicine or training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This knowledge has "systematic import."
    *   In contrast, "white things" is a true generalization (white things exist), but learning about one white thing tells you nothing explanatory about another, beyond the fact that it is white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. It lacks "systematic import."

Categories with essences, supporting explanatory generalizations, possess three key properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>:
1.  **Homogeneous**: All members share the properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
2.  **Stable**: The properties are not constantly shifting or changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
3.  **Intrinsic**: The properties belong to the thing itself, regardless of human observation or conception (e.g., horses would exist even without humans, unlike money) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Relevance and Essence

The concept of "relevance" does not possess a scientific essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

*   Things deemed "relevant" do not share a homogeneous set of properties with systematic import <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Relevance can be due to size, speed, proximity, or even a fleeting state like hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   Relevance is not stable; something can be relevant one moment and irrelevant the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Relevance is not intrinsic; it makes no sense to speak of things being relevant when no organisms are present in the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Therefore, relevance is not something the brain "discovers" in the world, but rather an outcome of a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This leads to an analogy with Darwinian fittedness, which also lacks an essence because the environment is dynamically complex and constantly changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Darwin proposed a universal process (evolution by natural selection) by which fittedness is continually redefined and redesigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Similarly, relevance realization is a process that constantly evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This process is a key tool in human cognition for navigating a "combinatorically explosive and constantly changing world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

The discussion regarding essence and scientific categorization ties into the broader theme of [[the_relationship_between_metaphysics_and_science | metaphysics and its relation to scientific concepts]] and the idea that humans need to distinguish between what is culturally useful and what is metaphysically true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The importance of [[Emergence and Reductionism in Science | complexity science and emergentism]] is also highlighted, as modern [[Metaphysics and its relation to scientific concepts | science]] offers a multi-level understanding of reality where categories are dynamic and evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. The integration of [[Complexity science and emergentism | complexity theory]] and [[Emergentism and complexity science | dynamical systems theory]] is seen as central to a more complete nomological order, especially through [[Complexity science and emergentism | cognitive science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

[[metamodernism_and_political_metamodernism|Metamodernism]], as developed by philosopher and writer Hanzi Freinacht, is presented as a response to and engagement with [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society|postmodernism]] and its critiques, specifically in relation to Jordan Peterson's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:42">[02:01:42]</a>.

## Postmodernism

Hanzi Freinacht's academic and philosophical upbringing was in a sociology department within a "very postmodern setting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This environment emphasized critical perspectives on:
*   Power relations in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>
*   The role of language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>
*   The social construction of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>
*   Skewed gender, human nature, human-animal, and class relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>
*   Knowledge being subject to power relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>

### [[critique_of_postmodernism|Critique of Postmodernism]]
While recognizing the "moral sensibilities or values of [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society|postmodernism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, Hanzi sought a "next step" beyond merely critiquing society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Jim Rutt highlights that the initially useful aspects of postmodernism, such as critiques of metanarratives and grand narratives, "hurdled" into what he calls "cultural nihilism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

Jordan Peterson's work is seen as a response to this cultural nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. However, Hanzi views Peterson's political philosophy (classical liberalism and conservatism) as a "step back" rather than a "step forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. Peterson's approach is characterized as a "reactionary response" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>, aiming to return to values of the past (e.g., 1965) which, while feeling safe compared to cultural nihilism, contained societal issues like subordination of women and racial segregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:13]</a>.

## Metamodernism

Hanzi Freinacht's journey beyond [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society|postmodernism]] involved discovering integral theory and developmental psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. He then found the term "metamodernism" emerging from academia and cultural theorists analyzing contemporary arts, architecture, and pop culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

[[metamodernism_and_its_philosophical_bases|Metamodernism]] proposes combining deep cultural analysis with spiritual and developmental perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. The goal is to "construct something after the postmodern deconstruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, retaining critical elements while using them to "create visions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This vision of progress is developmental, emphasizing the support of "inner growth of human beings as personalities" to foster "sane Societies or sustainable Societies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. It advocates optimizing society for human growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

[[metamodernism_and_political_metamodernism|Political metamodernism]] aims for a life philosophy that is "congruent with being crazy, with being radical or thinking outside of the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>, fostering "sober radical people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. It is described as a "somewhat more laid back Vision" and a "somewhat more hopeful Vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>, simultaneously more "secular and skeptical" and "more deeply spiritual or religious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>, with a "progressive Vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

### Sincere Irony and Oscillation
A core tenet of [[metamodernism_and_its_philosophical_bases|metamodernism]] is the concept of "oscillating between sincerity and irony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. This oscillation is likened to balancing scientific skepticism (irony) with magical belief and religious experience (sincerity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.

*   **Irony** implies holding multiple stances at once, including viewing reality as hypothetical or in superposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:05:00">[51:05:00]</a>. It involves a "certain skepticism" and awareness that one's beliefs or statements might not be entirely correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:39:00">[51:39:00]</a>.
*   **Sincerity** (or authenticity) requires being "ironic enough to check your facts," consider counter-positions, and allow for doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:54:00">[54:54:00]</a>.

Hanzi argues that "ironic sincerity is just real sincerity, and sincerity without irony is just not real sincerity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:29:00">[55:29:00]</a>. This allows for greater freedom of expression and authenticity because one is less defensive about being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:17:00">[57:17:00]</a>.

## Comparison and Integration

The key difference highlighted is that [[metamodernism_and_political_metamodernism|metamodernism]] seeks to "take what's useful from modernism [and] what's useful from [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society|postmodernism]] and step to the next level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. Whereas Peterson's response is seen as a "step back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a> to older values, [[metamodernism_and_its_philosophical_bases|metamodernism]] aims to integrate and move forward.

> "The critique of [[postmodernism_and_its_impact_on_society|postmodernism]] was perhaps timely and in many ways useful but it didn't bring with it all the gains of or the moral sensibilities of postmodernism... if you looked at the underlying political philosophy of Jordan Peterson... it is Classical liberalism and conservatism... but it just took a step back." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>

The [[metamodern_selfhelp|metamodern self-help]] approach, as exemplified by Hanzi's *12 Commandments for Extraordinary People to Master Ordinary Life*, offers a life philosophy that, while sharing some overlap with Peterson's thinking, has a different "sentimentality," "aesthetics," and envisions a distinct "form of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. This approach aims to help individuals find "Solid Ground on the other side of relinquishing the two-world model and the magic and the Supernatural" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>, integrating secular skepticism with deep [[spirituality_and_consciousness_in_meta_modern_contexts|spiritual experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a>.

![[challenges_in_applying_metamodernism_in_society|Challenges in applying metamodernism in society]] often involve navigating between scientific reductionism and magical thinking. Metamodernism suggests a developmental process of oscillating between these poles, eventually achieving a "superposition where both are true simultaneously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>. This allows for deeper engagement with both ruthless scientific scrutiny and rich spiritual experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>.

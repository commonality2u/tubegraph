[[Theories of Consciousness | Consciousness]] is one of the most challenging concepts to define <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. While individuals experience it directly, its precise nature remains elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

## Definitions and Fundamental Nature

### The Biological Perspective (Jim Rutt's View)
Jim Rutt aligns with the [[Theories of Consciousness | John Searle view]], proposing that [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] is a specifically [[Consciousness agency and biological information processing | biological phenomena]] that has evolved at least twice on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This perspective suggests [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] is the essence of a way of being for organisms with sufficient [[Neurological Mechanisms of Consciousness | neuronal support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. It enables the creation of a "movie" in which the organism is a subjective participant, appearing to make choices that affect the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

Rutt emphasizes a clear distinction between intelligence and [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. For example, a [[Consciousness and Sentience in AI | self-driving car]], though intelligent and capable of learning, is not conscious because it lacks the architecture for a subjective state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. Similarly, bacteria like E. coli, while intelligent in their adaptive responses, are not considered conscious because they lack neurons and a subjective state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

### The Ontological Primitive Perspective (Ian McGilchrist's View)
Ian McGilchrist finds it inconceivable that something wholly unconscious could give rise to [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. This leads to the view that [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] cannot [[Consciousness and Evolution | evolve out of unconsciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. He cites experts like V.S. Ramachandran and Colin Blakemore, who suggest that [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] may be an ontological primitive, an inherent part of the cosmos that does not originate from anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

McGilchrist posits that [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] is not confined to living things but is a constituent of the cosmos, manifested in different ways and potentially virtually absent in much of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. He argues that saying [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] "emerges" from biochemistry or matter often serves as a "miracle happens" explanation for something not yet understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. He highlights that physicists are as unsure about the nature of matter as they are about [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] at fundamental scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.

### Distinguishing Intelligence from Consciousness
Both Jim Rutt and Ian McGilchrist agree that intelligence and [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] are distinct.
*   **Intelligence:** Can be observed in single cells, like slime molds solving mazes and retaining memory even when fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. [[Consciousness and Sentience in AI | Self-driving cars]] also demonstrate learning and intelligence through swarm learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
*   **Consciousness:** While animals and even some plants are believed by Ian McGilchrist to be conscious, he doesn't equate their "intelligence" (e.g., a car's ability to react to unpredictable situations) with true conscious response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

## [[Neurological Mechanisms of Consciousness | Consciousness]] and Quantum Mechanics

Ian McGilchrist notes that some physicists, perhaps 15-20%, believe that [[Neurological Mechanisms of Consciousness | consciousness]] is entangled with quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This minority view suggests that the conscious observation of quantum systems is involved in their decoherence, or return from a quantum state to a classical state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. McGilchrist indicates that changing one's attention or [[Neurological Mechanisms of Consciousness | consciousness]] can produce changes in what is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

Jim Rutt counters that the vast majority of physicists (around 85%) disagree, asserting that [[Neurological Mechanisms of Consciousness | consciousness]] is not relevant to field collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. He emphasizes that quantum mechanics remains deeply debated, with many different interpretations that cannot be distinguished by current experimental evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## [[Emergent complexity and consciousness | Emergence]] vs. Ontological Primitive

The discussion explores whether [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] is an [[Emergent complexity and consciousness | emergent]] property or an ontological primitive.
*   **Emergence:** Jim Rutt describes [[Emergent complexity and consciousness | emergence]] as a new layer where interactions occur, producing higher-level phenomena not easily predictable from lower-level elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>. He argues that while we don't fully understand how it works, it appears to have happened from biochemistry to life and then to [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.
*   **Ontological Primitive:** Ian McGilchrist argues that [[Emergent complexity and consciousness | emergence]] cannot be used when there is no "little bit of [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]]" or "foreshadowing of [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]]" at a lower level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. He maintains that [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] is a fundamentally different phenomenon whose essence is "foreign to unconsciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

## [[Sentience and Levels of Consciousness | Consciousness]] in Non-Human Organisms

The participants discuss the presence of [[Sentience and Levels of Consciousness | consciousness]] in various life forms:
*   **Frogs:** Jim Rutt suggests that frogs possess a rudimentary [[Sentience and Levels of Consciousness | consciousness]], akin to a primitive 1982 computer screen, useful for basic tasks like catching flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.
*   **Plants:** Ian McGilchrist believes that certain, perhaps all, plants are [[Sentience and Levels of Consciousness | conscious]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. He agrees that frogs are also [[Sentience and Levels of Consciousness | conscious]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

## The Universe's "Potentia" for Consciousness

McGilchrist introduces the concept of "potentia," suggesting that the universe contains within it the potential for complex phenomena like [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>. This doesn't imply a predetermined design, but rather a "tendency" towards certain outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

This "potentia" implies that the universe is "fertile for life" and [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] at some level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. The existence of life and [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] confirms this inherent potential within the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

Regarding the Fermi Paradox (the contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial intelligence and the lack of evidence), McGilchrist states that the universe being "propitious to life" doesn't mean it's propitious everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. The universe is the right size for life to arise on one planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. He doesn't believe the paradox provides a definitive answer to the existence of other advanced forms of life or [[Theories of Consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>.

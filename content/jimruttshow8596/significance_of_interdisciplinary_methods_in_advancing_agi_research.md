The field of [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]], a term coined by [[ben_goertzels_views_on_artificial_general_intelligence_agi | Ben Goertzel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, refers to computer systems capable of intelligent behavior beyond their specific programming or training, demonstrating a capacity for generalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:59">[02:01:59]</a>. This contrasts sharply with [[comparison_of_narrow_ai_and_agi | narrow AI]], which excels at highly particular tasks based on programming or data-driven training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>. While [[comparison_of_narrow_ai_and_agi | narrow AI]] has seen significant practical success, it often fails to generalize effectively to new or slightly different situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:23">[03:38:23]</a>. The pursuit of [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AGI]] is increasingly accepted as feasible within our lifetimes, though a consensus on the most viable route to achieve it has not been reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:46">[06:01:46]</a>.

Many in the field, including [[ben_goertzels_views_on_artificial_general_intelligence_agi | Ben Goertzel]], believe that current Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and other mainstream Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are fundamentally unsuited for creating human-level [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AGI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. These systems often operate as "very large lookup tables" that recognize shallow, surface-level patterns in data, rather than building deep, abstract models of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>. The ability to find concise abstractions of experience is crucial for generalization, and this is largely missing in current DNNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

Instead, [[ben_goertzels_views_on_artificial_general_intelligence_agi | Ben Goertzel]] proposes [[different_approaches_to_agi_development_beyond_mainstream_methods | three viable paths to true AGI]] that emphasize interdisciplinary methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>:

## Cognitive Level Approach: Hybrid Neural-Symbolic, Evolutionary, Metagraph-Based AGI

This approach, exemplified by [[opencog_and_its_approach_to_agi | OpenCog]], is inspired by [[cognitive_synergy_in_agi_systems | cognitive science]] and optimized by advanced mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. It aims to emulate high-level human cognitive functions using various computer science algorithms, rather than strictly adhering to biological emulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

Key aspects include:
*   **Diverse Function Emulation**: Breaking down human cognitive functions (perception, action, planning, working memory, long-term memory, social reasoning) and developing specific computer science algorithms for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Synergy**: The critical challenge is to connect these diverse components so they can assist each other at a deep level, with transparency into each other's internal processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Representation**: A large, distributed hypergraph (or metagraph) serves as a common knowledge base, where different [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AI]] algorithms interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.
*   **Modern Logic and Learning**: Unlike "good old-fashioned AI" which used crisp logic and lacked learning, this approach incorporates fuzzy, probabilistic, paraconsistent, and intuitionist logics to handle uncertainty, and does not rely on hand-coding common sense knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **Implicit and Explicit Evolution**:
    *   **Implicit**: The system's attention allocation and logical reasoning processes, which select and combine knowledge chunks based on "fitness" (importance), mathematically resemble population genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. This means a distributed system with parallel operations and selection of best results inherently has an evolutionary aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.
    *   **Explicit**: Genetic algorithms are used for tasks like procedure learning and creativity, such as evolving new logical predicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.

This approach demonstrates interdisciplinary integration by combining symbolic logic, neural network-like pattern recognition (via attention mechanisms), and evolutionary principles within a unified framework.

## Brain Level Approach: Large-Scale Non-Linear Dynamical Brain Simulation

This path involves simulating the human brain at a more detailed, non-linear dynamical level, moving beyond the simplified models of deep neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.

Challenges and Interdisciplinary Needs:
*   **Measurement Limitations**: Current brain imaging instruments are insufficient to understand deep neural processes like abstraction formation or how chaotic attractors are driven in the cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. A revolution in brain imaging or direct neural activity measurement is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Biological Realism**: Simulating beyond just neurons to include glia, astrocytes, cellular diffusion, and even potential "wet quantum biology" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.
*   **Neuromorphic Computing**: While current neuromorphic chips focus on spiking neural networks, specialized hardware is needed for more complex chaotic neuron models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. This also ties into [[efforts_in_creating_a_scalable_infrastructure_for_agi | efforts in creating a scalable infrastructure for AGI]].
*   **Learning Algorithms**: Newer learning mechanisms, such as Alex Aurobia's predictive coding-based learning, which works with more biologically realistic neurons (e.g., integrate and fire with sub-threshold spreading of activation), are essential for better generalization and more compact neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>. These can potentially bridge the gap between biologically inspired neural nets and symbolic [[opencog_and_its_approach_to_agi | OpenCog]] systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Specialized Hardware**: The emergence of specialized chip architectures beyond GPUs, designed for specific [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AI]] algorithms like OpenCog's pattern matching or chaotic neurons, will be crucial for scaling up brain simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. This includes MIMD parallel processors and RAM-embedded architectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>.

This approach highlights the critical interplay between computer science, neuroscience, and hardware engineering.

## Chemistry Level Approach: Massively Distributed AI Optimized Artificial Chemistry Simulation

This highly speculative but intriguing approach draws inspiration from artificial life and biochemistry, simulating the emergence of complex systems from a chemical "soup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.

Key concepts include:
*   **Algorithmic Chemistry**: Abstracting the principles of chemistry, where "little programs" (codelets) interact to produce new programs in complex reaction chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Early work by Walter Fontana explored this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.
*   **Dual Evolution (Evo-Devo)**: The idea of co-evolving the underlying "chemistry" or gene expression machinery along with the resulting "phenotype" (intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>. This acknowledges that the physical substrate and its emergent properties are intertwined.
*   **Computational Challenges**: Simulating detailed, realistic chemistry or even highly abstracted algorithmic chemistry requires massive compute resources due to the inherent parallelism of chemical processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>.
*   **AI-Guided Evolution**: Incorporating an [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AI]] "observer" or "pattern miner" to study the evolving chemical soup, identify promising areas, and direct the evolution through techniques like mutation, crossover, or probabilistic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>. This creates a hybrid architecture where [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AGI]] aids in its own creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:17">[01:31:17]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Platforms**: Leveraging decentralized computing platforms like SingularityNET's NuNet could allow millions of individuals to contribute processing power to run virtual algorithmic chemistry simulations, fostering a grassroots research effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:53">[01:31:53]</a>.

This approach combines computer science, biochemistry, evolutionary computing, and distributed systems design.

## Significance of Interdisciplinary Approaches

The journey towards [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AGI]] is inherently interdisciplinary because human-level intelligence itself is multifaceted, involving perception, reasoning, learning, creativity, and social interaction, all grounded in a complex biological substrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. Relying solely on one narrow paradigm, such as the current focus on deep neural networks, overlooks critical aspects of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

For instance, the [[cognitive_synergy_in_agi_systems | cognitive synergy]] sought in the cognitive level approach necessitates integrating different computational paradigms (neural, symbolic, evolutionary) that traditionally exist in separate research silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. Similarly, the brain and chemistry level approaches require deep collaboration between computer scientists, neuroscientists, biologists, physicists, and hardware engineers to bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

### Funding and Future Directions

Despite the promise of [[different_approaches_to_agi_development_beyond_mainstream_methods | these diverse approaches]], [[progress_and_direction_towards_developing_agi | AGI research]] remains on the "margins" of the [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AI]] field, largely due to commercial interests prioritizing short-term financial returns from narrow [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AI]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:59">[03:00:59]</a>. There is a need for greater societal investment in a diverse "portfolio of bets" on less mainstream [[different_approaches_to_agi_development_beyond_mainstream_methods | AGI approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.

Such funding could come from:
*   **Government Initiatives**: Like the NIH in biology or DARPA in defense, governments could establish large-scale, integrated projects for holistic brain modeling or other [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AGI]] pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:31">[01:45:31]</a>.
*   **Cultural Shift**: A grassroots movement, similar to open-source software development, could emerge if more people recognize the viability and importance of [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AGI]] research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>.

Ultimately, the first path to [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_challenges_and_possibilities | AGI]] may incorporate ideas inspired by all three approaches, leading to a highly integrated, hybrid system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:10">[01:38:10]</a>. This underscores the profound [[cognitive_synergy_in_agi_systems | cognitive synergy]] that comes from interdisciplinary thinking and experimentation.

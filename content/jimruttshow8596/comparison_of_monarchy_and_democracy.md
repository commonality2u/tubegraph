The discussion between Jim Rutt and [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | Curtis Yarvin]] explores fundamental differences between [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | monarchy]] and [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]], with Yarvin advocating for a monarchical system as a practical and effective form of governance for a largely apathetic populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>.

## Critique of Modern Democracy

[[curtis_yarvins_critique_of_current_democracy | Curtis Yarvin]] argues that modern representative [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]] is largely symbolic and disconnected from actual power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

*   **Symbolic vs. Objective Reality** Yarvin suggests a gap exists between the symbolic and objective realities of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. While the purpose of [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]] is understood to be collecting the "wisdom of crowds" to create good government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, a significant goal is also to make people "feel that they're in charge" and give them a sense of importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This "power drive" is a fundamental human psychological need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Loss of Control** A primary unexamined assumption of [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]] is that it actually controls the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. However, Yarvin contends that [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]] is often not in full control of the state, implying that the "steering linkage is actually really not hooked up at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **De-politicization** The negative connotation of "politics" (e.g., "politicizing the justice department") when [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]] and politics are often seen as synonyms is perplexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Yarvin traces this negative view of politics back to the early progressive era, where the goal was to disconnect "the wires from the voters to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. This means people are taught that "[[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]] sucks" and that de-politicizing the government means taking power away from the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   **Political Parties and Legislatures** Modern politicians, especially in the US Congress, are primarily focused on fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, and legislative staff and lobbyists/activists often write legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. This leads to a system where politicians are "just pretty faces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>, and their debates are largely symbolic, not influencing votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This results in a "clown show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.
*   **Voter Behavior** Voter behavior in modern democracies is driven by a sense of collective fear and the need to defend against "the other side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>. Elections primarily determine "which side am I on in the cold civil war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

## Liquid Democracy as a Case Study

[[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | Liquid democracy]], originating from the Pirate Party in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, is a system where citizens can vote directly on everything or delegate their vote to someone else, potentially across different policy categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

*   **Goals of Liquid Democracy** Its supporters envision it as a way to "collect the wisdom of crowds" and provide effective public policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Jim Rutt's version suggests multiple proxies for various federal departments, where votes would flow up the "gradient of knowledge" to experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Yarvin's Critique: Herbivorous vs. Carnivorous** Yarvin views [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | liquid democracy]] as a "herbivorous idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, optimized for policy-making in a world where [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]] is assumed to be in absolute control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. He proposes optimizing it for "getting power" and "holding power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, transforming it into a "carnivorous" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **"Solid Democracy" as a Power Amplifier** Yarvin re-imagines [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | liquid democracy]] as "solid democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>, a "power amplifier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a> designed to concentrate and project power upwards towards a single, decisive center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.
    *   **Irrevocable Delegation** In "solid democracy," delegation would be frozen for a set period (e.g., four years) or even for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. This "unconditional power bond" provides confidence to the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>, enabling decisive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.
    *   **Eliminating Internal Conflict** The system would funnel all political power to a single point, avoiding internal conflicts and infighting characteristic of systems like the Pirate Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.
    *   **Centralized Control** This system would allow for the recruitment of candidates, centralized staffing, and strict party discipline, creating a powerful block in the legislature whose goal is to gain more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
    *   **Beyond Voting** Ultimately, "solid democracy" could extend beyond just voting to delegating the "power to participate in the political process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>. This could manifest as a leader using an app to direct followers for "demonstrations of force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>, essentially turning a population into a "paramilitary army of voters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
*   **The Outcome: Monarchy** Yarvin concludes that the logical end point of optimizing [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]] for maximum power and efficiency, especially in an apathetic population, leads to the design of a [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | monarchy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.

## The Case for Monarchy

Yarvin posits that [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | monarchy]] is the "natural system of government for a fundamentally apathetic and disengaged population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>, arguing it can restore order and efficient governance.

*   **Sovereignty is Conserved** Yarvin's "basic view on power is that sovereignty is conserved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>, meaning there's always a power structure, even if it's hidden behind a democratic façade. He points to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as an example of "democracy" being a mere claim to legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>.
*   **The King and the People Against the Nobles** Historically, a common alliance was "monarchy and [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]] against oligarchy" – the king and the people against the nobles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>. This alliance leverages the people's desire for peace and good government over a desire for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>.
*   **Unity and De-escalation** A [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | monarch]] can act as a unifying force, rising above factionalism and de-escalating political conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. The Roman Empire under Caesar and Augustus is presented as an example where intense "red versus blue conflict" disappeared once the monarch established peace and good government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>.
*   **Efficient Governance** A [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | monarchy]] is presented as a more efficient system, capable of cleaning up "chaos and ruin" and improving daily life, leading to public gratitude and universal apathy towards politics once fear is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.
*   **Modern Precedents** While dismissing "recency bias" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>, Yarvin cites examples like Singapore and pre-2019 Hong Kong as functional, non-democratic states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:57">[01:40:57]</a>. He also praises Deng Xiaoping as the "greatest political leader of the 20th century" for using absolute power to improve China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:59">[01:45:59]</a>.

## Concerns about Monarchy

Jim Rutt raises concerns about the practical implementation of [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | monarchy]]:

*   **Finding a Philosopher King** The challenge of finding a truly benevolent and capable monarch, a "philosopher king," is acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. The risk of corrupt, nepotistic, or "inbred" rulers is a known historical problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>.
*   **20th Century Tyrants** Rutt points to historical figures like Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot as negative examples of centralized power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:25">[01:41:25]</a>. Yarvin counters that these were "anomalies" or "wartime regimes" that set themselves against the "Anglo-American international community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:57">[01:41:57]</a>, rather than true examples of a peaceful, established [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | monarchy]] from the "center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:48">[01:46:48]</a>. He cites Salazar of Portugal as a more benevolent 20th-century dictator who "killed off the fascists" and communists to establish peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:25">[01:44:25]</a>.
*   **Resistance and Violence** The expectation that a transition to [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | monarchy]] would be met with violent resistance is downplayed by Yarvin. He suggests that such a change, if it comes from the center of power, could be a "joyous peaceful movement" like the fall of the Eastern Bloc in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.

Ultimately, while [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | Curtis Yarvin]] argues that [[curtis_yarvins_proposal_for_monarchy_in_the_usa | monarchy]] is a more "sustainable system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a> and a "mature decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a> for a modern society, Jim Rutt remains skeptical, preferring to seek "new thinking in better forms of [[liquid_democracy_vs_traditional_democracy | democracy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:53">[01:48:53]</a>.

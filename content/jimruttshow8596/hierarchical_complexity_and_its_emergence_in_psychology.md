[[Hierarchical complexity and cognitive development stages | Hierarchical complexity]] is a concept describing the qualitative increase in complexity of cognitive processes, skills, and understanding. It is a fundamental property of mental processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> and a ubiquitous process in the construction of skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Historical Context and Emergence
The notion of [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] represents one of the longest continuous research projects in psychology, emerging almost a century ago with Jean Piaget's 1923 publication of *The Language and Thought of the Child* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Earlier shades of the concept can be found in the works of James Mark Baldwin, Herbert Spencer, and natural philosophies of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

By the 1980s and 1990s, a "neo-Piagetian consensus" formalized the definition of stages across lifespan development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Key figures in this development include:
*   **Michael Commons**: Coined the term "Model of Hierarchical Complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> and articulated it as an almost mathematical construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. His work provided a formal definition of stages in neo-Piagetian theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
*   **Kurt Fischer**: A prominent neo-Piagetian who conducted important empirical work to validate the construct of [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. His "Dynamic Skill Theory" contextualizes the abstract model within a richly dynamical, embodied, and embrained person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, showing how it manifests in human skill and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. Fischer also pioneered applying dynamical systems modeling techniques from the [[complexity_science_in_organizational_context | complexity sciences]] to human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.
*   **Theo Dawson**: Psychometrically innovated around the construct, developing "Lectica levels" for formal psychological measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, which are considered the measurement standard for [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

## Hierarchical vs. Horizontal Complexity
A key distinction is drawn between [[difference_between_hierarchical_and_horizontal_complexity | hierarchical complexity]] (also called vertical complexity) and horizontal complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Horizontal Complexity**: Refers to doing more of the same task at the same level of complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Tying a thousand shoes in half an hour involves more of the same task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Taking an elevator from the lobby to the seventh floor, where each discrete sequence (pressing a button, waiting, walking in/out) is at about the same level and disjoint, is considered non-hierarchical in comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Hierarchical Complexity**: Involves performing a qualitatively more complex task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. It requires integrating lower-order capacities that have already been mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Making a shoe is hierarchically much more complex than tying a shoe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Disassembling, replacing a part, and reassembling a lawnmower engine is a more complex task, as every move depends on other moves and requires ancillary skills like organizing parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

Every skill has a certain amount of [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. For instance, focusing on an elevator button, accurately reaching out, and pushing it involves coordinating sensory-motor skills that were built through hierarchical integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Nature of Hierarchical Complexity
[[Hierarchical complexity and cognitive development stages | Hierarchical complexity]] is defined by the number of non-repeating recursions that coordinating actions must perform on a set of primary elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. Higher-order actions organize and transform lower-order actions, producing new, non-arbitrary organizations that cannot be accomplished by the lower orders themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. This process is often referred to as "chunking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a> or "hierarchical integration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

*   **Chunking**: The process where many lower-order processes are brought up and integrated by an [[emergence_and_complexity | emergent]] higher-order process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This occurs across different scales, from chunking sensory-motor systems to chunking complex theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. For example, a sprawling array of sensory-motor schemes (like dressing, brushing teeth) can be integrated into a single representation, "bedtime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   **Recursion**: A formal scoring criterion related to the non-arbitrary recursions needed to be integrated into a higher-order element to give it a specific score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. This means the concept can be applied to computer programming and other information processing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.

## Relationship to Broader Complexity Science and Emergence
The property of [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] is viewed as an almost general property of information across the biological spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. It reflects the broader phenomenon of [[emergence_of_complexity_in_life_and_the_universe | emergence]] in [[complexity_science_in_organizational_context | complex adaptive systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>, where complexity often emerges over multiple levels from simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

*   This process can be seen from atoms forming molecules, then cells, then multicellular organisms, organs, and systems of organs within an ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   The human mind's [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] is another example of this [[emergence_and_complexity | emergence of complexity]] from simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
*   There is a continuity between human and universal cosmological evolutionary processes, particularly articulated by process philosophy or [[complexity_science_and_emergence | complexity science]], regarding the [[emergence_of_complexity_in_life_and_the_universe | emergent]] higher-order or hierarchical complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

## Drivers of Hierarchical Complexity
Several factors drive the [[role_of_hierarchical_complexity_in_human_development_and_skill_acquisition | emergence of hierarchical complexity]] in the human mind:
*   **Working Memory Bottleneck**: The remarkably small short-term memory (e.g., seven plus or minus two items) is a significant driving function for [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. To work on more difficult problems, chunks of information must become denser, deeper, and more abstract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
*   **Complexity of the World**: If the world were not complex, a working memory bottleneck wouldn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. The environment's complexity, especially its abstract nature, is a driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
*   **Epistemic Motivation**: Humans have an innate need to understand, which drives information processing through the memory bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. Piaget distinguished between success (accomplishing a task) and understanding (knowing why it worked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. Most animals operate at the level of success, while humans often cross a threshold into seeking understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Lawful Universe**: The fact that the universe is lawful and patterns can be extracted incentivizes the biological cost of developing machinery to process reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

## Levels and Tiers of Hierarchical Complexity
Various models, including those by Commons, Fischer, and Dawson, describe similar sets of developmental levels, often seen as isomorphic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. Fischer's model outlines three primary tiers:
1.  **Actions (Sensory-Motor)**: This tier begins with single actions (e.g., focusing on a face) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, progresses to coordinating actions (e.g., looking and reaching to knock something off a table) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, and then to coordinating systems of sensory-motor skills (e.g., looking, reaching, grasping, bringing to mouth and drinking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. This rapid integration is evident in infancy and toddlerhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>. Early childhood engagement with diverse sensory-motor environments is crucial for building this foundational "pyramid" of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.
2.  **Representations**: This tier begins with the [[emergence_and_complexity | emergence]] of a "semiotic function," where sprawling sets of sensory-motor experience are summarized in a single utterance or gesture (e.g., "bedtime," "mommy," "doggy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. Children start to use linguistic signs to represent non-present realities, enabling counterfactuals or lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>. As representations map together (e.g., "mommy water" for "mom, I would like some water") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>, representational systems develop, allowing for endless descriptive stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
3.  **Abstractions**: This tier involves integrating many examples of representations into higher-order concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. Unlike representations, abstractions cannot be directly pointed at (e.g., "quality family time" generalizes across bedtime, dinner time, car time, but is not a specific event) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. This level corresponds to Piagetian formal operational levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. Abstraction requires education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>; basic understanding of democracy and law requires formal and systemic abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.
4.  **Principles (Meta-Systematic)**: This highest tier involves multi-systemic integration, creating a single theory from several different fields, like John Rawls's "justice as fairness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. It allows for norming the norms of conventions and making rules about the making of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.

## Application in Psychology and Education
[[Application of hierarchical complexity models in education and leadership | Hierarchical complexity]] can be operationalized in educational and research contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Diagnostic Assessment**: Lectica, co-founded by Zach Stein, developed a system for measuring cognitive development using [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. Unlike standardized tests that simply pass or fail, Lectica assessments diagnose what a person understands and suggest the next best thing for them to learn, creating a specific learning sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.
*   **Curriculum Development**: By using [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] as a universal ruler, domain-specific learning sequences can be rationally reconstructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.

### Hierarchical Complexity vs. General Intelligence (Spearman's G)
While there are correlations between [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] and general intelligence (Spearman's G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>, they are not the same.
*   **Oversimplification**: General intelligence tests (IQ tests) offer a summary statistic based on a narrow range of indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, often leading to the oversimplified and problematic classification of an entire person as "smarter" than another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. This approach is seen as a "demi-reality" that distorts social practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.
*   **Domain-Specific Measurement**: [[Hierarchical complexity]] is not assigned to a person, but to a particular task they accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. A person can demonstrate high [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] in physics but lower complexity in small engine repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.
*   **Misapplication to Populations**: Speculating about large populations reaching specific [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] levels (e.g., "X percentage of people reach level 12") is considered bogus due to insufficient empirical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. Classifying whole populations or persons based on a single level is strongly discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.

## Application in Leadership and Business
[[Application of hierarchical complexity models in education and leadership | Hierarchical complexity]] has been applied to leadership development in various organizations, including intelligence agencies and municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.
*   **Complexity Gap**: There's often a "complexity gap" between the task demands of leadership roles (which have increased qualitatively over time) and the capacities of leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   **Focus Areas**: Research found struggles emerging particularly in domains of:
    *   **Perspective Taking**: Imagining how others might react to a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.
    *   **Perspective Seeking**: Actively seeking out the perspectives of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.
    *   **Perspective Integration**: Integrating multiple perspectives to form a comprehensive understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.
*   **Expertise Fallacy**: Individuals with highly developed expertise in one abstract and complex area often have a complexity deficit in other areas and may apply irrelevant skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>.
*   **Diagnostic Tools**: Assessments based on [[hierarchical_complexity_and_cognitive_development_stages | hierarchical complexity]] are used for leadership development, not primarily for hiring or firing. They provide diagnostic reports with educational supports, identifying areas for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>. They can also help specify the minimum complexity threshold required for a particular role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:27">[01:24:27]</a>. These measures are more ecologically valid than traditional personality tests (e.g., Myers-Briggs) or IQ tests because they directly relate to the job's actual complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.

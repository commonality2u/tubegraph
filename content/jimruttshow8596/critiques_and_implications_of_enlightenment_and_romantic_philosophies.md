## The Enlightenment

The Enlightenment is considered a "second founding" of the United States, marked by figures deeply enamored with its ideals [1:29:56]. It posited that reason, understood as the logical and mathematical manipulation of propositions, combined with evidence, provides all the necessary tools to alleviate human suffering [1:31:57]. This era saw the rise of science and democracy as interconnected forces [1:32:25]. A key tenet of the Enlightenment was [[Critique and defense of liberal thought in modern context | secularism]], which asserts that the natural world operates independently from the supernatural [1:32:32]. This meant that religious and political spheres should be run separately, as the supernatural world was deemed irrelevant to the functioning of the natural world [1:32:46].

For the Enlightenment, [[Critique and defense of liberal thought in modern context | reason]], evidenced science (a self-correcting process), and a market (also a self-correcting process run by reason and evidence) were all that was needed to manage the world and end human suffering [1:33:34].

### Precursors to the Enlightenment
Key figures are identified as precursors to the Enlightenment:
*   **Martin Luther** Luther's philosophy, particularly his extreme version of Augustinian thought, suggests that personal transformation is completely driven by God and not by human participation [1:24:40]. This introduces a paradox where individuals are powerless but fully responsible for their salvation, leading to an unmediated, individual relationship with God [1:25:32]. His metaphysics, where God acts arbitrarily, is seen as leading to God becoming "completely absurd and irrelevant" [1:26:09]. The fragmentation of the Protestant church is attributed to its lack of a unifying ultimate vision [1:27:46].
*   **Ren√© Descartes** Descartes, like Luther, did not see a need for personal transformation in his philosophy [1:25:19]. He believed that a mathematical method of certainty, influenced by Galileo, could properly connect him to the world and alleviate the [[The Meaning Crisis and Nietzsches Philosophical Contributions | meaning crisis]] brought on by the scientific revolution [1:26:56]. In Descartes' view, God primarily serves to guarantee the scientific method's efficacy, thus becoming largely irrelevant otherwise [1:27:15]. Descartes' separation of mind and body is seen as a continuation of Aquinas's division of natural and supernatural worlds [1:12:17].
*   **Galileo Galilei** Galileo is seen as having "killed the universe" [1:14:49]. He challenged the Aristotelian view that things happen on purpose and have an inner life, by demonstrating inertial motion [1:17:50]. This implied that there is no grand purpose or narrative to the universe, reducing it to "just a bunch of stuff slamming into each other" [1:18:31]. Galileo, as a part of the revival of Platonism, asserted that mathematics is the language of the universe, suggesting that mathematical reality is more real than sensory experience or language [1:15:21]. This shift led to a reduction of "knowing" to propositional knowledge, where reality is judged solely by conviction, at the expense of other normative ways of understanding reality such as power, presence, and belonging [1:21:50].
*   **Thomas Aquinas** Aquinas's work is presented as a temporary patch on the challenge to the Christian worldview posed by the rediscovery of Aristotle's emphasis on the natural world [1:07:34]. Aquinas solidified the "two worlds mythology" by dividing reality into a natural world (accessible by science, reason, and observation) and a supernatural world (accessible only by faith, seen as a special gift or grace from God) [1:09:50]. This division, while preserving both science and theology, ultimately made the supernatural world seem less plausible and eventually absurd, paving the way for the self-sufficiency of the natural world [1:12:44]. The separation of the natural and supernatural is seen as destroying the Platonic concept of `anagoge` (ascent) and wisdom as a connection between the two worlds [1:12:30]. This philosophical move is considered a significant crack in the meaning framework that had been fundamental to the West [1:13:10].

### Critiques of the Enlightenment
The Enlightenment, despite its strengths, is critiqued for several flaws:
*   **Truncated Reason and Propositional Tyranny** The Enlightenment's view of reason is seen as "very truncated," leading to a "propositional tyranny" where all knowledge is reduced to justified true beliefs in propositions [1:34:01]. This overlooks other forms of knowing, such as skills (powerful/weak), perspectives (presence/connectedness), and identities (affordances/belonging) [1:22:44].
*   **Naive Newtonianism** The Enlightenment is seen as reeking of "naive Newtonianism" [1:35:51]. It lacks concepts of [[Critiques of postmodernism and modernity | complexity]], relativity, and systems thinking, treating the world as complicated rather than complex [1:35:56]. This "clockwork universe" view, while relying on self-organizing processes like markets and democracies, failed to incorporate the dynamic nature of such systems, thus hindering the development of wisdom-cultivating practices [1:37:38].
*   **Assumed Adult Competence** The Enlightenment, particularly exemplified by figures like Benjamin Franklin, assumed that a "standard smart adult person has all the tools they need to navigate the world" [1:35:10]. This overlooks the fact that adult human thinking is often full of distortions and may not have an optimal grip on reality, suggesting a need to go beyond the standard adult understanding of rationality to cultivate wisdom [1:35:19].

## Romanticism

Romanticism emerged as a reaction to the Enlightenment's "austere" view of the world [1:39:06]. It arose particularly from the implications of [[Historical philosophical shifts and their impact on meaning and agency | Immanuel Kant's philosophy]], where Kant argued that the mind shapes experience, and that mathematics describes how our mind organizes reality, not the universe itself [1:39:42]. This led to the conclusion that humans are "locked inside of our heads," creating a worldview that "robs you of all of those senses of connection that are central for meaning" [1:40:06].

### Core Tenets of Romanticism
*   **Reconnection through Irrationality** Romantics sought to reconnect to the world by exploring the "irrational aspects of the mind," moving backwards through layers of processing to discover a "true self" [1:41:50]. This concept was notably influenced by Rousseau, who posited a true self existing before the filtering of civilization [1:42:06].
*   **World as Empty Canvas** Romanticism reversed Locke's idea of the mind as a blank slate, instead viewing the "world as a blank slate" [1:44:40]. On this "empty canvas," individuals "press myself out," expressing their authenticity through acts of will and imposition [1:44:45]. This act of self-expression, rather than development, was seen as the path to wisdom and meaning [1:42:26].

### Critiques and Implications of Romanticism
*   **Flawed Concept of the "True Self"** The idea of an "inborn true self" that is merely expressed onto the world is seen as "very very questionable" and rejected [1:43:13]. The self is instead described as a "complex recursive dynamical system" that is "inherently developmental" and "aspirational," aligning with a Socratic model of the self [1:43:49].
*   **"Stupid Idea" of the World as an Empty Canvas** The notion of the world as an "empty canvas" upon which we can project ourselves, seen as the "ultimate culmination of [[Cynical theories and postmodernism | nominalism]]," is deemed a "genuinely stupid idea" [1:45:10]. It denies that the world is inherently structured with properties, patterns, and principles [1:45:27].
*   **Rejection of [[Socrates Plato and Aristotles philosophical impact | Virtue Ethics]]** Romantics are criticized for rejecting [[Socrates Plato and Aristotles philosophical impact | virtue ethics]] and the cultivation of character [1:46:16]. They often unfairly viewed individuals committed to virtue as "stultified, rigid, ossified," lacking the freedom and `joie de vivre` of letting the true self out [1:46:41].
*   **Roots of Totalitarian Ideologies** [[Historical Revolutions and Modern Implications | Decadent romanticism]] is argued to be the "grandfather of all the pseudo-religious ideologies" of the 20th century, including fascism and Marxism [1:48:08]. The idea of the world as a blank canvas, combined with the willful expression of a "true self," provides the philosophical basis for ideologies that seek to shape the world according to their will, leading to genocidal levels of political working out of these implications [1:48:15]. The glorification of the "inborn true self" is dangerously close to notions of racism [1:49:16].

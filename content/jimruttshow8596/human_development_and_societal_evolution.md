Humanity is currently undergoing a "world historical transition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> that could be catastrophic, leading to a "Mad Max" scenario, or could result in a "truly amazing future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> akin to "Star Trek" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Achieving a better future requires a "significant upgrade of our individual and collective capacity for thought and action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## The Current State: Game A

The current model of [[concept_of_civilization_and_societal_critique | civilization]], referred to as "Game A," is characterized by an escalating reliance on force and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Historically, unresolved disputes at the civilizational level led to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. After World War II, humanity faced the existential threat of nuclear annihilation, realizing the need to "grow up as a species" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> and pursue peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While the world has so far avoided nuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, the underlying "deep [[the_concept_of_code_and_its_impact_on_societal_development | code]] of Game A" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> fosters increasing technological capability within a context of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Accelerating Risks in Game A
This competitive drive accelerates humanity's capacity to destroy, leading to:
*   **Technological Proliferation**: Technologies like CRISPR enable catastrophic biological risks to be accessible to more actors, including large criminal enterprises, at an increasing pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Systemic Fragility**: A deeply technological [[concept_of_civilization_and_societal_critique | civilization]] becomes inherently fragile. Disrupting critical infrastructure like the power grid, which would have had little impact 150 years ago, could now be catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Arms Races**: The underlying logic of Game A drives "heedlessness or even recklessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, such as in AI research, where the imperative to stay ahead of competitors (e.g., China) leads to cutting corners on safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Ecological Limits**: Humanity is nearing or has exceeded the Earth's carrying capacity to support 8 billion people at the current average lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. As population peaks at 10-11 billion and lifestyles improve globally, environmental externalities increase, leading to a "micro corrosion or toxicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> that risks societal collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **War on Sense-Making**: Advanced cognitive neuroscience and AI are used to manipulate human choice-making through marketing and propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This "autoimmune disease on sense-making" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a> turns tools of understanding against themselves, disrupting the capacity for effective choice and compounding the race to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>.

These factors suggest that Game A is "careening towards the edge of the cliff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, as humanity wields "the power of gods without the wisdom of gods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## The Alternative: Game B

[[predictions_for_future_societal_changes | Game B]] is a proposed trajectory towards a better world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. It is "notoriously difficult to think and talk about" because using Game A's conceptual structures may "poison the well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>. Instead, it requires a "parallax perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>, viewing it through multiple succinct constructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>.

### Defining Game B
Game B can be understood as:
*   **Navigating Complexity**: Building the capacity to navigate complexity without resorting to complicated systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This involves developing skillfulness in individuals and groups to respond to natural, anthropo-complexity (of people), and techno-complexity (of technologies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.
*   **Meta-Protocol for Hyper Collaboration**: Game B is an emergent, distributed, and uncoordinated phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. It is a "boot protocol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a> that allows individuals to self-organize, orient themselves, and participate meaningfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Hyper collaboration suggests that everyone is already "playing Game B at level zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>, meaning it's omnipresent and one can choose to step into it and increase skillfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. This fosters "synchronicity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>, where disparate efforts align without formal coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.
*   **Architectural Attributes**: Early principles laid down for Game B emphasize being non-hierarchical, network-oriented, and "long-term metastable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>. These attributes appear to be driving its self-booting and self-growing aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:56">[01:24:56]</a>.

### Optimism for Game B
While Game A is currently vast and powerful, Game B holds promise due to the concept of the "adjacent possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>, as discussed by Stuart Kauffman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>. This concept suggests that new possibilities, generated by combining existing components, expand at a faster-than-exponential rate, potentially reaching infinity in finite time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>.

Game B, though starting small, can leverage a "slightly higher exponent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:59">[01:28:59]</a> in its capacity for innovation. This higher "rate of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>, especially in the context of accelerating change, can eventually "out-compete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:03">[01:41:03]</a> Game A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:03">[01:41:03]</a>. This is because Game A's deep [[the_concept_of_code_and_its_impact_on_societal_development | code]] is about increasing technological capability in a context of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, while Game B is designed to be "substantially better at innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44">[01:44:44]</a> and creative collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:53">[01:44:53]</a>.

A crucial distinction for Game B is that much of its innovation must occur at the level of "people, relationships, human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:03">[01:48:03]</a> and the [[role_of_ethics_in_societal_and_technological_evolution | cultivation of collective wisdom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:43">[01:48:43]</a>. This wisdom must be symmetric with or superior to the power generated by creative collaboration, acting as a "meta-design constraint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:55">[01:48:55]</a> to prevent rapid self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:20">[01:48:20]</a>. Game B must prioritize cultivating individual and [[evolution_of_human_collective_intelligence | collective sovereignty]], wisdom, and maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:08">[01:49:08]</a>.

## Preparing for Game B: The Pre-B World

The "pre-B" world is the current state where no fully functioning Game B group exists, but individuals and smaller groups are working to prepare for its emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:11">[01:50:11]</a>. Key aspects of this preparation include:

### Finding the Others
This involves connecting with like-minded individuals through platforms like the Game B Facebook group and #GameB on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:38">[01:50:38]</a>.

### Making Personal Changes
Individuals need to make changes in their lives to become "Game B ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:04">[01:51:04]</a>, including:
*   **Developing a Transparent Agentic Mind**: Seriously engaging with "liminality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>, being aware of one's own axiomatic assumptions, and being able to shift paradigms as contexts change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>.
*   **Orienting Choices by Meaningfulness**: Building the capacity to base choices on a deep sense of [[Human Nature and Societal Challenges | meaningfulness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:30">[01:52:30]</a>. This means overcoming the Game A tendency to rationalize or ignore what is truly meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:03">[01:53:03]</a>. It requires reconnecting with one's intrinsic values and making choices aligned with what is genuinely important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>. This also involves escaping the "matrix of status-oriented consumerism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:13">[01:51:13]</a>, which can lead to sacrificing personal well-being for external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:31">[01:55:31]</a>.
*   **Cultivating Humility**: Humility is "the handmaiden of liminality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a> and a "primary capacity to play Game B well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">[01:41:47]</a>. It entails recognizing the richness, depth, and complexity of reality that cannot be simply understood from a manual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:05">[01:42:05]</a>.
*   **Vocation and Right Livelihood**: Perceiving and pursuing one's "calling" or "ikigai" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>—that which one is uniquely capable of doing with exquisite care and capacity, and which lights up one's sense of meaningfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>.

### Experimenting with Piece Parts
Game B will require a holistic approach, which means discovering and adapting existing solutions or developing new ones across many domains:

*   **Parenting**: Shift from an asymmetrical "master and student" or "boss and employee" relationship to one of deep symmetry and humility, recognizing the child as a "fully realized soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. The parent supports the child's self-capacity building rather than impressing their own learned propositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>, while also being open to the child's teaching through liminality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.
*   **Conviviality**: Conscious design of [[cultural_evolution_and_modernity | culture]] (including rituals, tools, and gatherings) that fully supports personal, relational, and holistic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>. This emphasizes face-to-face interaction, taking relationship as sacred, and realizing the sacred in the ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. A simple potluck picnic can be more fulfilling than an expensive vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:46">[01:18:46]</a>.
*   **Sense-Making and Action-Taking**: Developing tools and practices for effective sense-making (like the Rally Point Alpha Facebook group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>) and then translating that understanding into effective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>.
*   **Health and Well-being**: Viewing health holistically, encompassing physiological, psychological, and relational health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>. Well-being then becomes the context that supports health "ongoingly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>, even under diverse circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>.
*   **Policing and Justice**: Rather than simply punishing, an event showing injustice is seen as a signal to slow down, enter a liminal space, and listen deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:04">[01:29:04]</a>. The focus is on increasing capacity for a more meaningful relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:58">[01:27:58]</a>, healing deep hurts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>, and strengthening conviviality from the bottom up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. This approach aims to make the system "anti-fragile to injustice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a>. When dealing with "defectors, free-riders, predators, and sociopaths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:04">[01:30:04]</a>, boundaries are necessary but implemented from a place of maturity and support, not reactive conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:20">[01:31:20]</a>. "Discernment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a>, the capacity to perceive reality without projecting one's framework, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>.
*   **Coherence**: A synergistic relationship among distinct parts that generates an emergent whole greater than the sum of its parts, while simultaneously enhancing the autonomy of each part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This "coherent pluralism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a> allows for immense specialization and division of labor while maintaining the integrity of the whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:58">[01:40:58]</a>. This capacity for coherence and supporting specialization may be a fundamental "biological [[the_concept_of_code_and_its_impact_on_societal_development | code]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:16">[01:41:16]</a> for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:08">[01:41:08]</a>.
*   **Scaling Beyond the Dunbar Number**: The "hard problem of Game B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:40">[01:42:40]</a> is to scale these coherent, collaborative principles beyond the Dunbar number (approximately 150 individuals, the limit for face-to-face communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a>). This requires finding an "attractor in reality itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:04">[01:44:04]</a> – an intrinsic dynamic between accelerating change and the structure of a distributed cognition group that allows it to move rapidly while maintaining integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:44:52]</a>. This implies "meta-learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>: improving the experimental protocol itself to accelerate learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:52">[01:48:52]</a>.

## The Emergence of "Proto-B"

The emergence of "proto-B" entities—the first attempts to create an "integrated way of Game B life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>—is expected to be a gradual, perhaps even surprising, process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:39">[01:51:39]</a>. These proto-B groups will likely initially depend on Game A for certain resources (e.g., computer chips, hospitals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:16">[01:50:16]</a> and must become adept at "parasitizing Game A," essentially pulling energy from it to build Game B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:35">[01:50:35]</a>.

Unlike past intentional communities that failed by operating at the lowest level of Game A (e.g., selling artisanal crafts), Game B experiments can leverage the "highest quality members," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:41">[01:53:41]</a> such as creative professionals (software developers, designers, scientists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:46">[01:53:46]</a>. If these individuals step into Game B, their capacity for creative collaboration will increase, potentially generating "highly disruptive economic innovations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:18">[01:54:18]</a> that provide massive asymmetric competitive advantages in Game A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:10">[01:55:10]</a>.

### Characteristics of Proto-B Groups
*   **Geographical Anchor (or Episodic Physicality)**: While a hard pruning rule for a proto-B is to be geographically anchored as a face-to-face community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>, episodic physical relationships (e.g., meeting quarterly) can maintain strong bonds for groups that primarily collaborate virtually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Inter-Group Collaboration**: Proto-B groups, being coherent and convivial, can also collaborate synergistically with other proto-B groups, largely virtually, expanding their collective innovation velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:25">[01:58:25]</a>.
*   **Learning from Failure**: Proto-B communities will inevitably face failures. However, these "honorable failures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:12">[02:00:12]</a>, when experienced from a place of integrity and humility, lead to "deep learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:45">[01:59:45]</a> and "wisdom," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:50">[01:59:50]</a> which individuals then carry forward to future attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:24">[02:01:24]</a>.

The challenge of developing Game B is complex, akin to the decades-long process of developing a laser from fundamental physics to physical implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a>. What Game B is attempting is "a whole lot harder and with a whole lot less resource" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:45">[02:02:45]</a>. Nevertheless, continued experimentation and meta-learning can drive progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:07">[02:03:07]</a>.

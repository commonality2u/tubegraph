Forrest Landry's "non-relativistic ethics" framework focuses on the concept of effective choice, defined not merely by outcomes but also by the preservation and increase of the capacity for future choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This approach integrates aspects of virtue ethics, deontological ethics, and consequentialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:27">[03:25:27]</a>.

## Non-Relativistic Ethics and Effective Choice

Landry's ethics is "non-relativistic" because it posits universal principles that apply to [[the_nature_of_choice_and_decisionmaking | choice]] itself, independent of specific situations or choosers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This contrasts with relativistic ethics, where "what is right to do is gonna depend upon the situation that one is in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

While his framework starts with a values-based orientation (like virtue ethics), it moves to a foundational perspective (deontological) and considers outcomes (consequentialist) in terms of "integrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:01">[03:38:01]</a>.

The core of effective choice involves creating change and preserving the capacity to create change, or even increasing that capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This emphasis on "capacity building" is akin to the economic concept of "optionality," which is generally considered beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Ethics vs. Morality

Landry distinguishes "ethics" from "morality":
*   **Ethics:** Focuses on general principles of [[the_nature_of_choice_and_decisionmaking | choice]] that apply universally, regardless of the "world" or context one is in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Moral Codes:** Refer to specific rules or codes particular to a "game" or a "world" (e.g., rules of a sport, workplace conduct, family settings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

Historically, the tendency to define right or wrong in absolute terms can impede the ability to act ethically by removing the possibility of [[the_nature_of_choice_and_decisionmaking | choice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. However, Landry later softened this stance, recognizing the value of "well-calibrated rule systems" like legal codes for enabling [[principles_of_good_governance | civilization processes]] and reducing cognitive load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. These are human constructs, not immutable metaphysical truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>.

## Self and Choice

The concept of "self" in Landry's work is not limited to human-type selves but extends to any subjective entity capable of [[the_nature_of_choice_and_decisionmaking | choice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. This theory would apply to "aliens living in some other universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. Instead of "self has choice," it's "choice has self," implying that the self is an epiphenomenon of the continuous co-occurrence of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:22">[02:18:22]</a>. This perspective suggests that an entity lacking capacity for choice (like a rock, in the context of [[effective_complexity_and_integrated_information | integrated information theory]]) would not be considered a "self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:01">[02:34:01]</a>.

## Principles of Effective Choice

### Integrity, Potentiality, Life, and Evolution

To increase the effectiveness of choice, one must simultaneously preserve integrity and increase the potentiality of both life and evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

*   **Integrity:** Defined as "to act as one together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. It signifies coherency, cooperativeness, and diversity combining to produce results greater than the sum of their parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. Ethics, as a set of practices, arises from this concept of integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

### Symmetry and Continuity

Maximizing potentiality and integrity involves maximizing the combination of symmetry and continuity in the relationship between self (subjective) and reality (objective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. This can be understood through the metaphor of a communication channel:

*   **Symmetry:** Refers to the correspondence between what is at one end of the channel (subjective) and the other (objective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. A lack of symmetry indicates degradation in the integrity of the communication channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.
*   **Continuity:** Relates to the smoothness of energy transmission through the channel, avoiding abrupt shifts that could disrupt communication or harm the medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

While these concepts are abstract, they become richer when considering the "contents" of self and world, such as a person's evolving understanding of botany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.

### Value, Meaning, and Purpose

These three concepts are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable, forming a "triple aspect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. [[role_of_choice_in_subjective_experience | Meaningfulness]] is considered the underlying concept, with value and purpose existing in a reciprocal relationship within its context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.

*   **Purpose:** Ascribed from the outside, like a toaster's function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>.
*   **Value:** Intrinsic worth, inherent to the item itself, not dependent on external ascription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.
*   **Meaningfulness:** The relationship between self and reality; it's neither purely internal nor external, residing in the dynamic of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. For example, making toast for a loved one adds a romantic, narrative meaning beyond its mere function or intrinsic worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.

Understanding the meaning of one's life is crucial for making good choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>.

### Want, Need, and Desire

These also relate to where satisfaction occurs:
*   **Want:** Satisfied externally (e.g., buying a candy bar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.
*   **Need:** Satisfied internally (e.g., body metabolizing food for energy and growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:28">[01:36:28]</a>.
*   **Desire:** Satisfied on the "boundary between the inside and the outside," requiring relationship (e.g., the shared understanding of a word in a language) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>.

Identifying these correctly is essential for effective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:39">[01:38:39]</a>.

## Challenges to Effective Choice

*   **Uncertainty and Incomplete Information:** All choices involve uncertainty, and one can never know all consequences, partly due to [[chaos_and_decisionmaking_in_crisis_situations | chaos and complexity]] and fundamental non-determinism in the universe (e.g., quantum mechanics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **Over-reliance on Abstraction:** Academic "trolley problems" and other hypotheticals are often misleading because real-life choices are embodied, requiring "the practice of feeling as much as with the process of thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:29">[01:39:29]</a>.
*   **Communication Failures:** Effective communication is best facilitated when participants grant each other the right to speak, the right to be understood, and the right to know one has been understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>. This is a "protocol" for high-integrity communication, enabling error correction and the emergence of a "larger reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Suppressing these rights (e.g., through assuming malice or stupidity, typical of "conflict theory" rather than "mistake theory") makes ethical communication impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>.
*   **Sociopathic Tendencies:** Highly integrated sociopaths, while perhaps effective at exploiting niches, can be destructive to [[community_credit_and_decisionmaking | community integrity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. However, from an evolutionary perspective, neurodiversity, including traits like sociopathy (exploitative) and autism (creative), might be necessary for a species to endure and thrive in varied circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. The increasing prevalence of these traits in modern society is a "major hazard" to civilization, highlighting the need for [[principles_of_good_governance | civilization structures]] resistant to "game A" (sociopathic) processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.

## Practical Importance

The increased capacities brought by technology make the [[impact_of_societal_values_on_political_choices | relevance of ethical thinking and feeling]] more crucial than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:44">[01:42:44]</a>. Applying these principles to individual lives, communities, and nations is essential for navigating existential risks and designing a sustainable civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>.

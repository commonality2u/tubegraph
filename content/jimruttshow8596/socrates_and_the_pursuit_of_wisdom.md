[[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]] is recognized as a pivotal figure in [[historical_philosophical_influences | Western philosophy]] and is deeply associated with the pursuit of wisdom and [[Nature of Truth and Values | truth]] through self-examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:12">[01:33:12]</a>. His ideas, particularly his emphasis on [[self_and_reality_in_metaphysical_studies | knowing oneself]], laid foundational groundwork for subsequent philosophical and [[philosophical_and_religious_insights | religious insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.

## The Socratic Revolution

The emergence of [[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]] is understood as a "kairos" or a critical turning point in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. This period saw a "second order thinking" come online, influenced by new psychotechnologies like alphabetic literacy and numeracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. This enhanced metacognition, allowing for critical awareness of the mind, identifying pervasive [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self-deception]], and fostering a capacity for self-transcendence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.

[[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]] utilized this cognitive shift to promote different identities and perspectives, leading to the pervasive "two worlds mythology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>. While this model is criticized for its potential for manipulation, it also highlights the human capacity to "see through illusion and into reality," a defining feature of wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.

## "Know Thyself"

The watchword of [[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]] was "Know Thyself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:23">[01:33:23]</a>. This command does not refer to one's autobiography or a pre-packaged identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. Instead, it is about becoming aware of the "machinery of the self" and actively directing one's "selfing" (turning the self into a verb) towards becoming a wiser and more virtuous person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a>. For [[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]], true [[self_and_reality_in_metaphysical_studies | self-knowledge]] is interwoven with knowing others and the world, continuously seeking connections across these three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>. This pursuit is inherently aspirational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:18">[01:36:18]</a>.

## Socrates vs. Natural Philosophers

[[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]] was impressed by the endeavors of the natural philosophers who sought to understand the [[Nature of Truth and Values | nature]] of things through observation and reason, but he found their approach lacking in providing guidance on how to become wiser or overcome [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self-deception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a>. He sought truths that were disclosed *in* transformation and that, in turn, *afforded* further transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>. This reciprocal relationship distinguishes wisdom from mere knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:56">[01:36:56]</a>.

## Socrates vs. The Sophists

[[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]] famously criticized the Sophists, whom he saw as teaching people to "bullshit" themselves and each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>. The Sophists developed rhetoric, a psychotechnology that made things deeply salient and promised powerful transformation, but often disconnected from any attempt to get at the [[Nature of Truth and Values | truth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>. This led to pervasive individual and group [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self-deception]] and contributed to the rise of demagoguery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.

In contrast to lying, which relies on someone else's concern for the [[Nature of Truth and Values | truth]], "bullshitting" involves directing one's attention to make something salient, regardless of its truth value, leading to a self-deceptive cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:31">[01:42:31]</a>. [[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]] recognized that the mind can be manipulated through this process, disengaging attention from a concern for [[Nature of Truth and Values | truth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>.

## Truth, Salience, and the Examined Life

[[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]]'s core tenets included knowing that he did not know and the declaration that "the unexamined life is not worth living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:26">[01:48:26]</a>. This "unexamined life" refers to a life devoid of the continuous effort to couple "salience for transformation" with [[Nature of Truth and Values | truth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.

For [[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]], the pursuit of wisdom involves cultivating "virtue" (meaning a power encompassing skills, states of mind, and character traits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>. This meta-virtue of wisdom leads to seeking transformative truths and allows for the revelation of truths through transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:29">[01:49:29]</a>. Such a life offers the most [[philosophy_and_ethics_in_modern_society | meaning in life]], which is crucial for tolerating and compensating for the unavoidable suffering and pain that life entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>.

## Socrates and Altered States of Consciousness

Historical accounts suggest that [[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]] himself engaged in practices that induced altered states of consciousness, such as standing in a trance for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>. This aligns with the understanding that such states can afford extraordinary abilities and insights, similar to how shamans used various methods to deliberately alter consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:05">[01:33:05]</a>.

## Legacy

[[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Socrates]]'s profound influence, particularly through his disciple [[socrates_plato_and_their_impact_on_western_philosophy | Plato]], led to the "Socratic-Platonic revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>. This period, alongside the emergence of major world religions, established enduring [[philosophical_schools_of_ethics | philosophical schools of ethics]] and approaches to understanding existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. His work is considered a significant part of the [[historical_philosophical_influences | historical philosophical influences]] that continue to shape thought today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

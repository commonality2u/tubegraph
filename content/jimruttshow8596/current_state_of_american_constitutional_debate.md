The ongoing debate about the United States Constitution is a significant aspect of contemporary American political discourse, especially in light of discussions around a "National Divorce" or potential intentional splits within the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:09">[01:59:09]</a>. While the concept of a "National Divorce" generally implies a splitting apart of the country, the underlying constitutional debate often focuses on the preservation and interpretation of the existing framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## The Constitution's Role and Perceived State
The Constitution is viewed by some as "the last best hope for individual liberties in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>. Its strength is seen as greater when more people are bound by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:51">[02:57:51]</a>.

However, there is a belief among some proponents of a "National Divorce" that the Constitution and the American experiment itself are "failed experiment[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>. Others suggest that the U.S. has not effectively adhered to its constitutional principles since at least 1933, if not earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, with some even pointing to the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments as a departure from original intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:04">[03:37:04]</a>.

## Diverging Interpretations and Proposed Changes
In the event of a "National Divorce" leading to multiple new polities, it is anticipated that new constitutions would emerge, or existing ones would "start to evolve in different directions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Left-leaning Constitutional Views
The political left is described as being "very interested in changing the Constitution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:27">[02:52:27]</a>, with some expressing dislike for [[political_power_and_systems_in_the_usa | divided powers]] and even advocating to "abolish the Supreme Court" following decisions like the 9-0 ruling regarding ballot access in Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This perspective suggests a desire for constitutional reform to better align with current political goals.

### Right-leaning Constitutional Views
The political right is also proposing amendments, such as "parental rights amendments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, recognizing that these rights are not explicitly enshrined outside of the 14th Amendment and judicial interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Should a "Red State" entity form, its evolving constitution would likely "move back more in that direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a> of limited government and strict interpretation, disallowing elastic interpretations of clauses like the Interstate Commerce Clause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Calls for Constitutional Engagement and Revival
Given the ongoing [[political_polarization_in_the_united_states | political polarization]], there is a call for Americans to become more familiar with the founding documents, including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This emphasizes a perceived "massive educational problem" regarding the nation's founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, attributed in part to "critical history" and "anti-American nonsense" in schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

Instead of a "National Divorce," there's an advocacy for people in all states, especially "purple and blue States," to "take the fight to their state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This involves:
*   **Fighting for local control**: Inspiring a "civic revival" where people actively work to prevent their communities from deteriorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   **Promoting constitutional literacy**: Working to bring states "back to a more constitutionally centered" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Engaging in legal and political action**: Encouraging Attorneys General to pursue actions like antitrust lawsuits against corporate collusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a> or supporting referendums on issues like gender-affirming care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This also includes fighting against initiatives like ESG requirements and "natural asset companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

The belief is that the Constitution "frankly works when you have people who understand it and are willing to stand up for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This proactive engagement, likened to a "50 stars project," aims to avoid running out of "space left to run" and instead encourages people to "turn and stand on the soil" of their home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

From: [[jimruttshow8596]] <br/> 

The realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) necessitates a novel approach to economic transactions, particularly for micropayments, due to unique constraints related to time, cost, and peer-to-peer communication between AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Traditional financial systems and even current blockchain technologies are often too slow and expensive to facilitate the high-frequency, low-value transactions required for AI-to-AI interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

## Challenges with Traditional Transaction Systems for AI
AI agents require responses within milliseconds; a delay of even 100 milliseconds means an agent will likely move on to another task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with human transaction speeds, which can tolerate delays of seconds or minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

Furthermore, the value of individual AI services might be incredibly small, such as 0.01 cents for a single page translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. Existing third-party systems like Visa or ledger-based blockchains have transaction costs that far exceed such micropayments, making them economically unfeasible for AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

## TOA IP: A Peer-to-Peer Protocol for AI
TOA IP is a network communication protocol designed to eliminate dependency on third parties for value exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Co-authored by Tui Saliba and Dan, its name was initially a placeholder but later gained significance, partly referencing physicist Moratu TOA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

The protocol enables sub-second communication between AI devices where value is generated in milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. It achieves this by embedding all necessary cryptographic proof within the very first network packet of a handshake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This peer-to-peer approach eliminates the friction of time and cost associated with intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

TOA IP utilizes a definitive data structure, specifically Earth 64, which ensures each transaction or "container" has a unique global number, preventing double-spending and verifying ownership instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>. The cost of a TOA IP transaction is primarily the compute performed by the two communicating devices, making transactions as low as 0.00001 cents economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. This system is described as a "ledger-less blockchain," where events are proven to have occurred within a block of time without a traditional ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>.

## Hypercycle and AI Node Economy
[[decentralized_networks_for_ai_and_the_role_of_hypercycle | Hypercycle]], co-founded by Tui Saliba, is built on the TOA IP protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. It functions as a container (HYPC) that can encapsulate various forms of value, such as USD (via USDC) or Bitcoin, enabling them to traverse the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:00">[32:04:00]</a>.

Funds are "deployed" into the Hypercycle system via a decentralized smart contract called CHPC, which acts as a bridge to fungible assets on external ledger-based blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>. This bridge tracks what goes in and out, ensuring that the total value within the Hypercycle system matches the "locked" value on the external blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>. While transactions *within* Hypercycle are nearly free, cashing out to traditional systems still incurs their associated fees (e.g., $2 for an Ethereum transaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. This creates a system where AI agents can conduct millions of low-cost, fast transactions, only settling to a slower, more expensive external system when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>.

The focus on AI is strategic: the complexity of AI compute services makes it difficult for entities to "fake" work, thus ensuring legitimate transactions and avoiding direct competition with established financial or blockchain systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:00:00">[46:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:00]</a>. This approach turns potential adversaries (banks, traditional blockchains) into partners, as they benefit from facilitating onboarding/offboarding for the rapidly growing AI ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:08:00">[48:08:00]</a>.

### Wealth Creation at the Node Level
Hypercycle introduces a model for wealth creation at the individual AI node level, rather than solely at the corporate level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:12:00">[49:12:00]</a>. Owning a Hypercycle node (costing about $1000 for a "node factory" that can generate 1024 nodes) allows participants to capture the appreciation in value of their AI services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:56:00">[52:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07:00">[53:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. If an AI service (e.g., a highly accurate Italian translator) becomes highly sought after, its value, and thus the value of the node operating it, appreciates significantly. This intellectual property and its growth belong directly to the node operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:19:00">[55:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:35:00">[55:35:00]</a>.

## Facilitating Decentralized AGI
The ability for AI agents to easily and securely transact for services across different entities (e.g., one agent from Microsoft communicating with another from Google) is crucial for the development of decentralized [[Emergent risks of AI and societal impacts | AGI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This interoperability ensures that AGI is not controlled by a single entity, mitigating [[the_ethical_implications_of_ai_development | ethical risks]] and allowing a global, diverse approach to its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. This also contrasts with [[AI as a selfleveraging accelerator posing existential risks | centralized AI development]] models, which raise concerns about who would dictate the AGI's ethical framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

While large language models (LLMs) are a significant step in [[evolution_of_ai_and_societal_impacts | AI's evolution]], they alone will not lead to AGI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. The path to AGI involves machines capable of self-evolution without human intervention, requiring only time and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. This decentralized model, connecting diverse AI components, is seen as the "Trojan Horse" for achieving a safer, globally distributed AGI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.

## Complementary to SingularityNET
Hypercycle is complementary to projects like [[singularitynet_and_its_decentralized_ai_economy | SingularityNET]]. While SingularityNET focuses on the AI operating system and the AI nodes themselves, Hypercycle provides the underlying secure network that allows any AI agent to communicate and transact with any other agent, regardless of their native platform (e.g., Microsoft, Google, or other decentralized AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This creates an "internet of AI" where agents can freely interact and get compensated securely, leveraging existing protocols like HTTPs and direct TCP connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.

## Getting Involved
Developers interested in Hypercycle can find documentation, including core whitepapers and hackathon resources, at hypercycle.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. Development on Hypercycle nodes primarily uses Python, making it accessible to a wide range of AI developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. The project aims to encourage widespread participation in this new AI economy, fostering a more decentralized and collaborative future for AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

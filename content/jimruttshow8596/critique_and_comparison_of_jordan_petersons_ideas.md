The work of Jordan Peterson and his ideas serve as a significant point of comparison and critique for philosopher Hanzi Freinacht, particularly concerning the development of [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy|metamodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Freinacht's newest book, *12 Commandments for Extraordinary People to Master Ordinary Life*, is explicitly framed as a response to Peterson's *12 Rules* and *12 More Rules* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Peterson's Approach: A Step Backwards
Freinacht's academic and philosophical upbringing was in a "very [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy|postmodern]] setting," which deeply imbued him with [[critiques_of_postmodernism_and_modernity|critical perspectives]] on societal power relations, the role of language, the social construction of reality, and the skewing of gender, human nature, and class relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. He sought to move beyond mere critique to construct something new, integrating ideas from integral theory and developmental psychology to advance beyond [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy|postmodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Upon discovering Jordan Peterson in 2017, Freinacht observed Peterson's crusade to defend "truth university" against "justice university" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. However, Freinacht argues that Peterson's response to [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy|postmodernism]] was not [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy|metamodernism]]—a step forward—but rather a "step back" to [[critique_and_defense_of_liberal_thought_in_modern_context|classical liberalism]] and [[criticism_of_political_parties|conservatism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. This, according to Freinacht, represented a "regression backwards" to "modern values" such as responsibility and individualism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

The Jim Rutt Show host, Jim Rutt, echoes this sentiment, viewing Peterson's *12 Rules* as "Common Sense Circa the times when I was growing up 1960-65" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. Rutt acknowledges the initial utility of [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy|postmodernism]] in critiquing metanarratives but notes that it devolved into "cultural nihilism," to which Peterson's work was a "reactionary response" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. Peterson's approach suggested a return to an idealized past, like 1965, which, while feeling "safe" compared to cultural nihilism, was problematic due to the subordination of women and racial minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

Freinacht's aim is to offer a path forward, taking what is useful from modernism and [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy|postmodernism]] to "step to the next level which is [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy|metamodernism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

### Freinacht's Metamodern Response
Hanzi Freinacht's new book is a "metamodern response to Jordan Peterson's self-help," where Peterson had the "largest and widest impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. While there is a "significant" overlap in thinking, Freinacht states that his "underlying sentimentality is different," as are the "aesthetics" and the "form of life" he envisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. His vision is described as "somewhat more laid back," "more hopeful," "more secular and skeptical," yet "more deeply spiritual or religious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. It also carries a "progressive vibe," departing from Peterson's Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

Freinacht states his book is a "handbook for sanity among the groups who are already doing these things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>, referring to the "liminal web of radical social changers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. He aims to create a "life philosophy" that is "congruent with being crazy with being radical or thinking outside of the box," fostering "sober radical people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>. This contrasts with Peterson's approach, which Freinacht argues, if followed, leads to "being a boring conservative" who is "still part of a world that's going down the drain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.

### Key Comparative Points:

*   **Critique of [[cynical_theories_and_postmodernism|Postmodernism]]**: While Peterson offered a timely and useful [[critiques_of_postmodernism_and_modernity|critique of postmodernism]], it lacked "progressive content" and did not retain the "moral sensibilities of [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy|postmodernism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Freinacht seeks to integrate the critical elements of sociology and humanities with spiritual and developmental perspectives to construct something *after* [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy|postmodern]] deconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Individual Responsibility vs. Social Context**: Peterson emphasizes individual responsibility and avoiding "social reductionism," where personal issues are wrongly attributed to societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51">[42:51]</a>. Freinacht introduces "individualist reductionism," arguing that it's equally problematic to turn social issues (e.g., Jim Crow laws) into solely individual responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:03">[43:03]</a>. His "Heal with Justice" commandment links personal healing and congruence to the pursuit of social justice, emphasizing that genuine social justice flows from internal alignment, rather than hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>.
*   **"Clean Your Room" vs. "Live in a Mess Moderately"**: Peterson's famous advice to "clean your room" implies perfect order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:53">[40:53]</a>. Freinacht counters that one doesn't "owe having a neat home to anybody nor do you have to have a life in perfect order to valuably partake in society and work for its improvements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00">[41:00]</a>. He notes that intelligent people tend to be messier and warns against the judgmentalism inherent in Peterson's "Mrs. Clean types" vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:25">[41:25]</a>.
*   **The Guru Game**: Freinacht explicitly critiques the "guru game," which he describes as people claiming "secret knowledge" for personal gain or to maintain influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>. He considers it a problematic tendency, evident in "totalitarianism and Cults," including the "huge YouTube followings" of figures like Peterson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>. Instead of following a guru, Freinacht advocates for "triangulating different perspectives" and finding "others" who can engage laterally in cooperative teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:08">[01:41:08]</a>. This aligns with the Game B community's emphasis on finding "the others" and achieving "coherence" without a central guru figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>.
*   **Spirituality and Religion**: Peterson, despite having confessed to being an atheist in *Maps of Meaning*, attracts a fan base that tends to be "more traditionally religious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:28:00">[01:0:28:00]</a>. Freinacht's approach embraces a secular skepticism while also being deeply spiritual, aiming for a "superposition" where ruthless scientific scrutiny can coexist with safe exploration of the magical realm and spiritual experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. He seeks to go "beyond the Divide of Science and spirituality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>, a pursuit shared by figures like Brendan Graham Dempsey and John Vervaeke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>. Freinacht's "reverse Christianity" posits forgiving God or reality for its imperfections, rather than seeking forgiveness from a higher power, leading to greater peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>.

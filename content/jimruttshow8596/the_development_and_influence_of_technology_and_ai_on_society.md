## Introduction

Technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are profoundly shaping human society, pushing humanity into an "internet age" that is fundamentally changing our civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This ongoing transformation necessitates a re-evaluation of our relationship with technology and the future trajectory of human progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## From Human Birth to Technological Creation

The core narrative of human technological development suggests that man's envy of woman's ability to give birth led to the creation of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. As technology develops over time, unlike the consistent intelligence of children, it is projected that technology will eventually surpass or at least significantly complement human capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Our civilization is moving towards creating machinery or technology that will either outdo us or complement us, initiating a new direction for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## The Dual Nature of Technology: Pharmakon

All technology is characterized as a "pharmakon," meaning it is both a potential solution and a potential danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. For instance, the atomic bomb, developed in 1945, demonstrated humanity's capacity to create machines that can cause self-extinction, highlighting a critical point in modern history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Conversely, nuclear power, and potentially future fusion nuclear power, could save humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. The impact of technology depends entirely on how humanity chooses to wield it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.

## The Evolution of Intelligence and AI

Compared to the vast potential of AI, humans are considered "barely generally intelligent," possessing limitations like a small working memory and low-fidelity memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Historically, inventions like the alphabet, Arabic numbers, and the zero were arguably more significant than the printing press or the internet in augmenting human cognition by enabling interaction with "exterior devices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

Instead of "artificial intelligence," a more appropriate term is "symbiotic intelligence," recognizing that technology is inherently linked to humans, making us "homo technological" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The focus should be on designing [[existential_risks_and_opportunities_of_ai | symbiotic intelligence]] to benefit humanity before it's too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

A long-term projection suggests that AI, possibly combined with bacteria, might be the entity to conquer outer space, potentially leaving humans in a "human zoo" on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. This highlights a speculative yet critical aspect of the [[existential_risks_and_opportunities_of_ai | future of AI's influence]].

## Societal Transformations Driven by Technology

The internet age, though promising, has brought about significant societal "mess" as existing institutions resist change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This era also carries the risk of extinction through atomic warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The "Digital Libido" book explores this period, serving as a warning about the challenges and potential dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This relates to the broader [[impact_of_technology_on_societal_values_and_behaviors | impact of technology on societal values and behaviors]].

## The Role of Information Technologies

Information technologies, such as the printing press (invented around 1450), act as "portals" that enable new developments rather than directly causing societal shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. The spread of literacy centuries after the printing press, for example, enabled the rise of powerful, literate armies and new paradigms of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Similarly, the internet provides a substrate for new things to evolve, including science, self-governance, and modern finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. This perspective aligns with how [[technological_evolution_and_its_impact | technological evolution and its impact]] influences societal development.

## Addressing the Challenges of Modern Technology

A critical challenge today is the pervasive nature of addictive technologies, such as smartphones and social media platforms like Instagram, which can lead to significant psychological and social harm, particularly among young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>. This highlights the need for greater discernment regarding the technologies allowed into our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

### Designing Communities with Technological Discernment

One proposed solution involves creating communities with "membranes" or protocols that define acceptable technological use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. For example, a community could ban smartphones for children under a certain age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. This allows for the creation of cultural norms that support healthier interactions with technology, making it easier for parents to enforce such rules without imposing external costs on their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. This approach directly addresses the [[impact_of_algorithms_and_ai_on_society | impact of algorithms and AI on society]] and how communities can respond to it.

The process of adopting new, beneficial models, such as controlled technology use, follows a pattern: technological disruption leads to anarchy, then a "plurality" where a few individuals or groups find successful ways to use technology, becoming leaders whose models can then be mimicked by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. This iterative process of experimentation and adoption is key to navigating the ongoing [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_various_industries | impact of AI advancements on various industries]] and society at large.

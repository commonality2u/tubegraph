Forrest Landry, CEO of Magic Flight, conducts research into how product and system design influences culture and ecology, and the nature of the interface between the organic and inorganic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. His company, a woodworking business, emphasizes renewable materials and first-person experiences, seeking simple solutions to complex problems by going beyond traditional design methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Technology's Impact on Society and Environment

[[the_development_and_influence_of_technology_and_ai_on_society | Technology]] has drastically changed the world, with the introduction of the internet, cars, and planes significantly altering human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:30">[08:30:30]</a>. While [[role_of_technology_and_science | science and technology]] provide tools for understanding causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>, modern society often faces a "lost opportunity" due to choice-making processes not grounded in long-term perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

Humanity is currently at an epochal point where the future could be glorious or disastrous, depending on the choices made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. [[impact_of_technology_on_societal_values_and_behaviors | Technology]] has empowered humanity to create and destroy the entire world through advancements like nuclear weapons and biotechnology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a>. This immense power necessitates a high level of ethical coherence, akin to the "wisdom of gods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>, to avoid destructive outcomes like nuclear winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>.

One major challenge is the unsustainability of practices like industrial farming, which causes significant damage to the complex outer ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The shift from an evolutionary approach that worked for billions of years changed about 250 years ago with the harvesting of fossil fuels, which exponentially increased human capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:28:00">[45:28:00]</a>. This power now dwarfs the resilience of natural systems, leading to the potential for utter destruction of ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:47:00">[45:47:00]</a>.

### Challenges in Information Ecology

[[the_role_of_social_technologies_in_shaping_civilization | The internet]], despite its potential, has inadvertently created incentives for disinformation ecologies, leading to a decline in quality information sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:25:00">[51:25:00]</a>. Social media [[the_role_of_social_technologies_in_shaping_civilization | technology]] is currently primarily deployed to serve corporate interests and shareholder benefit, neglecting community and user well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:01:00">[59:01:00]</a>. This has led to a "multipolar trap" and "rules for rulers" dynamic, which compulsively drives short-term market interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

The Center for Humane Technology advocates for a reorientation of social [[the_role_of_social_technologies_in_shaping_civilization | technology]] to prioritize community service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:13:00">[59:13:00]</a>. The argument is that technology companies with platform authority must be responsible for the well-being of the community using their platforms, preventing disinformation and prioritizing collective benefit over individual gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Towards Responsible Choice-Making

To navigate the challenges posed by [[the_development_and_influence_of_technology_and_ai_on_society | technology]], society needs to move from a state of "muddle blind deaf and dumb" to one of sense-making, choice-making, and action-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:11:00">[50:11:00]</a>. This requires:
*   **Accurate Perception:** Perceiving the world as accurately as possible and sharing information transparently, without personal filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:04:00">[52:04:00]</a>.
*   **Good Questions:** Asking the right questions to understand the current state of the world and guide effective choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:19:00">[52:19:00]</a>.
*   **Values-Based Approach:** Acknowledging that current market-driven processes are too short-term and require a deeper, values-based, and meaningfulness-based way of thinking about decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. Values should be stronger than purposes, providing the basis for collective choice-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>.

The current system of institutions often has tremendous implementation capacity but terrible sense-making capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. Solving global problems at a species level requires a distributed approach rather than centralized platforms, as no single human or small group can possess the wisdom of billions needed to process the vast amount of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. The goal is not just efficiency but quality of choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.

Ultimately, humanity must develop new capacities in sense-making, choice-making, and implementation to confront the existential risks posed by the asymmetric power of [[the_development_and_influence_of_technology_and_ai_on_society | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. This involves integrating knowledge from various fields including science, [[role_of_technology_and_science | technology]], sociology, anthropology, psychology, and philosophy to create new capacities for community design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>.

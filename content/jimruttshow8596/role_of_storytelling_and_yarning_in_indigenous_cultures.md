Tyson Yunkaporta, an academic, art critic, and researcher from the Apalech Clan of Australian Aboriginal people, describes Indigenous culture not as a museum artifact but as a living, adaptive system [0:10:07]. His work primarily focuses on [[impact_of_modern_civilization_on_indigenous_knowledge_systems | Indigenous knowledge systems]], specifically the "ways of thinking and patterns of thinking and... systems of logic" that have shaped him [0:54:19]. This perspective offers an [[indigenous_perspectives_on_complexity_and_reality | Indigenous lens]] through which to view the wider world [0:21:18], often aligning with concepts of complexity theory [0:30:32].

## Yarning: A Modality of Distributed Cognition

A central concept in Indigenous cultures, as described by Yunkaporta, is "yarning" [1:22:29]. Unlike the old-fashioned, humorous connotation of the word in American English, yarning is a sophisticated process for arriving at truth and informing decision-making [1:22:33].

Yarning functions as a modality that arises from a distributed form of governance and cognition [1:22:38]. The truth and the "big picture" of a given context are formed through an aggregate of stories, not by a single dominating narrative [1:23:04]. Every person's story must be heard, and the truth resides in the collection of these stories [1:23:20]. Even outliers, or stories that do not align with the consensus, are considered important [1:23:41]. This process supports [[the_role_of_narratives_in_understanding_and_decision_making | the role of narratives in understanding and decision making]] and can inform [[emergent_narratives_and_problemsolving_processes | problem-solving processes]].

### Characteristics of Yarning
Yarning is described as a "ritualized conversation" within a group [1:23:52]. It is dynamic and often involves overlapping contributions, acting things out, or drawing images in the air or on the ground [1:24:00]. This process is typically conducted around an activity, such as making something, or accompanied by shared food and drink [1:24:21]. The ultimate goal is to reach a "loose consensus of what the reality is" to enable effective planning and decision-making in the real world [1:24:10].

### Beyond Western "Talking Circles"
Yunkaporta critiques Western interpretations of "talking circles" that attempt to emulate Indigenous practices but often miss the mark [1:23:33]. He notes that these simplified versions can turn a genuine "circle" into a linear "queue," where individuals take turns monologuing [1:25:41]. A true yarn, in contrast, is "a lot more complex" and yields "very important outcomes" [1:25:52].

An example provided by the interviewer, of deer hunters collectively sharing observations and stories about deer behavior and terrain to decide hunting spots, resonates with the concept of yarning [1:26:05]. This shared, non-linear conversation leads to a deep, collective knowledge of the place and informs practical, coordinated actions [1:29:53]. This illustrates how [[the_role_of_narratives_in_understanding_and_decision_making | narratives]] and their aggregation can directly influence outcomes and decision-making within a community.

## Stories as Living Knowledge and Maps
[[Concepts of metaphysics and storytelling | Stories]] are not merely entertainment; they serve as vital tools for preserving and transmitting practical knowledge [0:22:01]. For instance, oral histories and songs in Indigenous cultures function as maps, retaining knowledge of lands now submerged due to sea-level rise thousands of years ago [0:21:50]. This demonstrates the incredible time depth and adaptability of Indigenous knowledge systems and their [[the_role_of_rituals_and_community_practices_in_meaningmaking | role of rituals and community practices in meaningmaking]].

Yunkaporta suggests that the familiar feeling many people have when encountering Indigenous ways of thinking stems from these practices being "human baseline" or "factory settings" [1:30:18]. He encourages individuals to find their own "fragments" of this wisdom within themselves, as "each fragment contains the pattern of the whole" [1:31:09]. This approach offers a path towards reclaiming deeper, more resonant ways of living, incorporating "deep real human things" into future societal designs [1:31:54].

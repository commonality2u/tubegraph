Robert Sapolsky, an American neuroendocrinology researcher and author, holds a strong incompatibilist view on [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]], asserting that it does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. His most recent book, "Determined: A Science of [[life_without_free_will | Life Without Free Will]]", delves into this famously complex topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>. Sapolsky considers his position, which states "there's no free will whatsoever," to be at the "lunatic fringe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, as most people and philosophers do not share this absolute stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

## The "Turtles All the Way Down" Argument

Sapolsky frames his argument using the "turtles all the way down" anecdote, where every event is caused by a prior event, leading back indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. He contends that claiming an action can occur "without any causes whatsoever" is scientifically incorrect and ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. His book aims to present a comprehensive picture from various disciplines to close off any "escape valve" for [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

He explains that understanding *why* someone does something requires examining a continuous "arc of influences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, ranging from:
*   **Immediate Brain Activity**: What was happening in their brain "just now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Current Physiological State**: Factors like being tired, stressed, hungry, or euphoric, which affect brain function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Hormone Levels**: Daily hormone levels influencing brain sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Recent Experiences**: Trauma or positive events in previous months that alter brain workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Developmental History**: Adolescence, childhood, and even fetal life, which significantly shape brain construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Genetics**: Inherited genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Ancestral Culture and Environment**: The culture and ecosystems of ancestors, influencing upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:23]</a>.

Sapolsky argues that when one looks closely at this continuous chain, "there is not a crack anywhere in there in which you can shoehorn in a kind of free will that requires you to invoke magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Examples of Influences

Sapolsky provides surprising examples of how behavior is underlined by often unrecognized influences:
*   **Environmental Odors**: People become more politically and socially conservative when filling out questionnaires in a room smelling of "stinking garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, whereas a smell of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies makes them more generous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This occurs without conscious awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Fetal Stress Hormones**: Chronic maternal stress during pregnancy leads to elevated stress hormones in the fetus, resulting in a larger and more reactive amygdala in the child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, making them more likely to perceive neutral faces as threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Ancestral Infectious Disease Load**: Cultures whose ancestors faced high infectious disease loads 400 years ago tend to be less welcoming to immigrants and novelty today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:13:07]</a>, influenced by early childhood training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   **Blood Glucose Levels**: Lower blood glucose levels impair the prefrontal cortex's ability to exert impulse control, making individuals more prone to "dumbass impulsive" actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

Sapolsky challenges the idea that these are merely "urges" or "influences" that don't add up to complete determination, arguing that every single factor contributes to the ultimate outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Categorizing Views on Free Will

Sapolsky outlines four main positions on [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]]:
1.  **Libertarians (philosophical)**: Believe in a completely undetermined world where individuals are entirely free in their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Sapolsky dismisses this as paid "virtually no attention to" by most philosophers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
2.  **Undetermined World with Responsibility**: Those who believe the world is undetermined but people are still held responsible for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:19:02]</a>. Sapolsky finds this even less coherent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
3.  **Compatibilists**: The majority (90-95%) of philosophers who reconcile [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] and responsibility with a deterministic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. They accept that we are biological machines governed by physical laws, but still find room for free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:45]</a>.
4.  **Incompatibilists (Sapolsky's stance)**: Believe in a totally deterministic world, meaning there is no [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] and thus "notions of responsibility make no sense at all" in theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This view is shared by a small majority of brain scientists but only about 2% of philosophers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:21:01]</a>.

Sapolsky rejects the legal system's criteria for culpability—intent, understanding consequences, and perceived choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:24:12]</a>—because it fails to ask the crucial question: "where did that intent come from?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. He likens this to reviewing a movie having only seen the last three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:42]</a>.

## Agency vs. Free Will

When discussing [[consciousness_agency_and_biological_information_processing | agency]], Sapolsky distinguishes between mere physical responsibility (e.g., bumping into someone when tripping) and the intuitive philosophical sense of being "the captain of your ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:27:02]</a>. He argues that in the latter sense, agency is synonymous with [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]], and thus, "there is no Captain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:07]</a>. Even seemingly complex decisions, like evaluating risks in a confrontation, are outcomes of accumulated deterministic influences, such as cultural background and past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:30:10]</a>.

## Neuroscience and [[neurological_mechanisms_of_consciousness | Consciousness]]

### Phineas Gage

A foundational case in [[neuroscience_consciousness_and_nontraditional_religious_experiences | neuroscience]] illustrating the brain's role in personality and moral behavior is that of Phineas Gage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. Gage, a railroad foreman in the 1840s, suffered a traumatic brain injury when an iron pole shot through his prefrontal cortex (PFC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:36:05]</a>. The PFC is the most recently evolved part of the human brain, responsible for impulse control, gratification postponement, and inhibiting "animal urges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:32]</a>. After his injury, Gage, previously a responsible man, became "abusive, alcoholic, bully, sexually disinhibited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:56]</a>.

Sapolsky emphasizes that such drastic changes in personality and self-discipline don't require gross brain damage. Subtle influences like:
*   **Fetal Stress Hormones**: Can lead to a less metabolically active PFC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:16]</a>.
*   **Childhood Environment**: Growing up in a violent neighborhood can result in fewer synaptic connections in the PFC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:27]</a>.
*   **Poverty**: Can lead to a smaller PFC by age five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:36]</a>.

These factors cumulatively explain an individual's capacity for emotional control, illustrating that actions are products of biological and environmental history, not uncaused choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:54]</a>. People often "confabulate" explanations for their behavior after the fact, unaware of the true underlying causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:43:31]</a>.

### [[libets_experiment_on_decisionmaking_and_the_role_of_the_unconscious_mind | Libet's Experiment]] and "Free Won't"

Benjamin [[libets_experiment_on_decisionmaking_and_the_role_of_the_unconscious_mind | Libet's experiment]] famously showed that brain activity (readiness potential) precedes conscious awareness of a decision to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:48:31]</a>. This led many to conclude that the brain decides before "you" consciously do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:49:13]</a>. Sapolsky, however, finds the resulting debate about milliseconds of decision-making "totally boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. His core critique remains: the experiment doesn't address "where did that intent come from in the first place?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:30]</a>.

The concept of "free won't" (the ability to veto an action) is also dismissed by Sapolsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:55:00]</a>. He argues that the decision to inhibit an action is subject to the exact same deterministic influences as the decision to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:57:00]</a>.

### [[neuroscience_consciousness_and_nontraditional_religious_experiences | Consciousness]]'s Role

Sapolsky regards [[neurological_mechanisms_of_consciousness | consciousness]] as irrelevant to the question of [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:58]</a>. He notes that while consciousness is fascinating, much of what it does is try to explain "why did I do that just now" after the fact, rather than being the causal agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:16]</a>.

## Dispelling Illusions of Free Will

### The Myth of Grit

Sapolsky criticizes the "myth of grit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>, tenacity, and self-discipline as falsely dichotomized from biological predispositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:30]</a>. Society praises "grit" as a magical, uncaused quality, distinct from "biological stuff" like coordination or memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[01:00:18]</a>. Sapolsky argues that tenacity and self-indulgence are "exactly as biological" as any other trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:52]</a>, rooted in the prefrontal cortex and shaped by the same "arc of influences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:03:00]</a>.

He references the "marshmallow test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:48]</a>, where a child's ability to delay gratification at age five correlates with future health, earnings, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:36]</a>. This seemingly volitional act is predictable from differences in brain function and early life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:12]</a>. For Sapolsky, there's "no difference than being 7 foot 4" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:32]</a>; both are outcomes of deterministic factors.

### The Illusion of "Key Cusp Decisions"

The idea that individuals make a few "key cusp decisions" that define who they become (e.g., choosing to go to college) is also challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:05]</a>. Sapolsky asks *why* someone makes that particular choice, again tracing it back to genetic makeup, upbringing, influential teachers, and other circumstances. The "inspiration" to make a life-altering choice is itself an outcome of prior deterministic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:12:42]</a>.

## Scientific "Escape Valves" and Their Demise

Sapolsky also addresses scientific concepts sometimes invoked to support [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]]:
*   **Deterministic Chaos**: He agrees that deterministic chaos, where small changes in initial conditions lead to vastly unpredictable outcomes, does not provide room for [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:14:12]</a>. Unpredictability is not the same as being uncaused.
*   **Quantum Indeterminacy**: While acknowledging that the universe's fundamental nature (deterministic vs. stochastic) is still debated in quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:15:17]</a>, Sapolsky dismisses it as a source of [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] for three reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:16:15]</a>:
    1.  **Scale**: Quantum effects are too small (subatomic) to impact macroscopic brain activity significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:46]</a>.
    2.  **Randomness vs. Will**: Even if quantum effects scaled up, they would produce randomness, not stable, purposeful behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:31]</a>.
    3.  **Harnessing**: The idea that a "conscious you" could "harness" quantum indeterminacy at a subatomic level is "idiotic" and requires a basic rejection of how physics functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:18:15]</a>. The brain is too "moist and warm and messy" for quantum coherence to be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:19]</a>. This is often leveraged in "New Age Quantum" theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:22]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_free_will_and_emergence_in_modern_scientific_discourse | Emergent Complexity]]**: Sapolsky loves the concept of emergence—where complex properties arise from simple interactions of many elements (e.g., wetness from water molecules, ant societies from individual ants, [[neurological_mechanisms_of_consciousness | consciousness]] from neurons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:24:03]</a>. However, he argues that theories trying to derive [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] from emergence fail because they require the individual building blocks (e.g., neurons) to "suddenly get smarter" or "work differently" once part of a larger system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:25:52]</a>. This violates the core principle of emergence, where the individual components retain their simple rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:47]</a>.

While acknowledging "downward causality" (macro-level decisions affecting micro-level elements, like rolling a stone down a hill affecting its electrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:29:02]</a>, Sapolsky distinguishes this from "harnessing" elements to make them act outside their physical laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:30:08]</a>. Abstract concepts like "honor" or "law and order," while influencing behavior, are still manifestations of the deterministic brain and culture, not independent agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:29:51]</a>.

## Implications of No Free Will

Sapolsky addresses the common concern that rejecting [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] would lead to societal chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:15]</a>. He argues the opposite: [[the_impact_of_beliefs_about_free_will_on_society | a world without belief in free will]] would be "a much more humane place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:17]</a>.
*   **Ethics**: Studies show that individuals who have deeply considered the absence of [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] are just as ethical as those who strongly believe in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:48">[01:40:14]</a>. Casual rejection of [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] might lead to short-term moral lapses, but deep philosophical engagement does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:31">[01:39:44]</a>.
*   **Change**: The idea that "nothing can ever change" without [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:12]</a>. People change, but they are "changed by the circumstances that put you in that place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:34">[01:41:41]</a>.
*   **Justice and Responsibility**: Society can still contain dangerous individuals (like a car with broken brakes) by quarantining or containing them without invoking moral judgment or punishment beyond what is necessary for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:43:59]</a>. Similarly, competent neurosurgeons can be recognized and utilized without attributing their skill to a "better soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:25]</a>.
*   **Compassion**: Rejecting [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] promotes compassion by recognizing that individuals are shaped by factors beyond their control (e.g., genetic predispositions to obesity, rather than "lack of willpower") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:45:23]</a>. It removes the "crappy screwed world" where people are judged and punished for things they couldn't control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:27">[01:45:57]</a>.

Sapolsky concludes that while the idea of no [[determinism_vs_free_will_debate | free will]] might initially feel like a "bummer," it is ultimately "fabulous" and will lead to a more "humane Planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:10">[01:46:13]</a>, much like abandoning the belief in witches improved society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:41">[01:46:51]</a>.

[[Protopian Narratology | Protopian Narratology]] is a philosophical discipline focused on understanding the different kinds of stories human beings tell about themselves and others, recognizing that these stories serve distinct purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It is described as the "logos of narratives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This approach moves beyond traditional deconstruction, aiming to provide a specific philosophical framework for narrative analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## The Grand Narrative Trilogy
Alexander Bard and John Senayquist have developed this concept through a series of books, notably the [[grand_narrative_trilogy | Grand Narrative Trilogy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, which explores narratives from the future, present, and past.

### Synthesism: Creating God in the Internet Age
The first book, *Synthesism: Creating God in the Internet Age*, starts with the future, based on the assumption that man, envying woman's ability to give birth, creates technology, which will eventually surpass or profoundly complement humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This points to the idea of a "symbiotic intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, where humans, as "homo technological" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, guide technological progress to benefit humanity before self-extinction, such as through atomic warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Digital Libido: Sex, Power and Violence in the Network Society
The second book, *Digital Libido*, focuses on the present, highlighting the chaotic and challenging nature of the internet age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. It serves as a warning about the potential for societal collapse due to ongoing conflicts and the messiness of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Process and Event
The third book, *Process and Event*, "rewrites the history of ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. It posits that many fundamental human ideas originated during the Bronze Age, with subsequent advancements primarily being technological improvements for managing large populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This approach emphasizes the power of historiography and the ability to reinterpret the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Components of Narratives: Mythos, Logos, and Pathos
Within [[narratology_and_ethics | narratology]], narratives are primarily understood through three components:
*   **Logos**: Represents factual truth or what actually happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Mythos**: Refers to how humans tell stories about facts, incorporating imagination and fantasy to define themselves and their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The distinction between "Game A" and "Game B" is presented as a conflict between two different mythoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Pathos**: The location of stories about sex, violence, the subconscious, drives, desires, rivalry, and envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. Pathos is never coherent or balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>. Unlike Western traditions that often suppress or ban pathos (e.g., in Christianity and Islam), Eastern philosophy (e.g., Tantra) acknowledges it as a vital part of humanity that must be dealt with, separate from the logos and mythos of community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>.

Ethos, while important, is not considered a narrative itself but rather the outcome or result of narratives – the determination of what is the "right thing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.

## Protopianism: An Alternative to Utopia and Dystopia
A core tenet of [[protopian_narratology | protopian narratology]] is the rejection of utopian and dystopian thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, both of which are seen as products of dualistic Western philosophy rooted in Christianity and Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

*   **Utopia** (e.g., as conceptualized by Plato or leading to figures like Pol Pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>) seeks a perfect, unchanging world, which would logically be a "dead world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
*   **Dystopia** (e.g., leading to concepts like Armageddon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>) similarly creates a false narrative that can lead to catastrophic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

**Protopianism**, a term coined by Kevin Kelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, embraces the idea of tearing down and rebuilding the world daily, constantly making slight improvements to its construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. It emphasizes iterative development, similar to engineering, and acknowledges the contingent nature of historical "leaps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. This approach aligns with Eastern philosophy's non-dualistic worldview, shared by systems and complexity theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

## Applications and Implications
Protopian Narratology has several practical implications for societal design and individual action:

### Implotation vs. Exploitation
"Game A" is characterized by the idea of infinitely exploiting the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, while "Game B" proposes the opposite: "implotation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Implotation means that resources cannot be used unless they are replenished or put back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, aligning with the understanding that exponential growth in a finite world is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Designing Communities with Membranes and Protocols
[[Designing strategic interventions using narrative | Protopian communities]] operate through voluntary participation and "membranes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. These semi-permeable membranes allow people to "walk in and walk out" of systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>, preventing totalitarianism by ensuring opt-out possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. This approach mirrors natural systems and biological membranes, which regulate information flow with an effort required for entry and exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.

Within these membranes, "protocols" are established—agreed-upon standards that govern behavior and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. These protocols are designed to be copied and shared, facilitating communication and cooperation between different communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. This enables parallel experimentation in a "high-dimensional design space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>, allowing different communities to explore varied rules, such as technology use (e.g., banning smartphones for children) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. If a model proves successful, it can be mimicked by others, leading to societal transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.

### Technology as Pharmakon
All technology is viewed as a "pharmakon"—it is neutral and can be both a cure and a poison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. The atomic bomb, for instance, can destroy humanity but nuclear fusion could save it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. The outcome depends entirely on human choices and how technology is wielded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. Discernment in technology adoption is crucial for protopian communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

### Anarchy to Pluralarchy to Order
Technological disruption inevitably leads to an initial state of anarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. This then shifts into a "pluralarchy," where a few individuals or groups ("elites") figure out how to effectively use the new technology to their advantage, gaining followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. These elites then lead the implementation of a new order to the chaos, providing models for others to mimic and adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

### The Role of Art, Sex, and Violence
Art, sex, and violence are categorized under pathos and are never harmonious or balanced forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>. They are pharmakon forces that must be acknowledged and dealt with rather than suppressed, as attempted by some traditional dualistic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

## Philosophical Foundations
[[Protopian Narratology | Protopian Narratology]] draws from various philosophical traditions:
*   **Hegelian Dialectics**: Used to create temporary solutions when confronted with complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.
*   **Monism**: A core rejection of Western dualism (mind-matter separation, as in Descartes), embracing Spinoza and Leibniz's view that everything is interconnected and expressions of the same world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. This aligns with Eastern philosophy's consistent monistic worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   **Asha (Zoroastrianism)**: The concept of "asha" (similar to "dao" in Taoism or "arta" in Sanskrit) represents "how the world works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. A constructive mindset towards the future, involving engagement with how the world works, forms the ethical foundation for a protopian approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. This involves accepting the past as necessity ("amor fati" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>) while actively co-creating a contingent future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

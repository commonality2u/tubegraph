The discussion explores the concepts of [[Emergentism and complexity science|emergent complexity]] and [[Consciousness and its origins|consciousness]], particularly in relation to the argument against free will.

## Emergent Complexity
[[Emergentism and complexity science|Emergent complexity]] is described as a "totally cool" subject, where putting enough quantity of simple elements together can "invent quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

Examples of [[Emergentism and complexity science|emergence]]:
*   **Ants** One ant is not very smart, but 10,000 ants together can build a society, structures, and even air conditioning vents in their colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>. They can solve complex problems like the traveling salesman problem using simple rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>.
*   **Neurons** One neuron is not amazing, but 100,000 neurons together can form a fruit fly brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Eighty billion neurons, the same type of neuron, can together invent aesthetics, theology, and economic philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Water** A single molecule of water (H2O) cannot feel wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>. "Wetness" is an emergent property that only appears when enough water molecules are gathered together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>.

The core idea of [[Emergentism and complexity science|emergence]] is that properties emerge that cannot be predicted, identified, or defined at the level of individual components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. For instance, an individual tuba player does not know what the entire marching band is supposed to look like, but the whole emerges from their simple rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. Our brains are entirely emergent at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>.

### Emergence and Free Will
Despite the "totally cool" nature of [[Emergence of Life and Complex Systems|emergent complexity]], it is argued that free will is *not* an [[Emergence and complexity in life|emergent property]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. This is because models positing free will as emergent require the individual building blocks (like ants or neurons) to suddenly become "smarter" or work differently when part of a larger system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>. However, the fundamental principle of [[Complexity science and emergentism|emergence]] is that these individual pieces remain "stupid little building blocks" with their simple rules, even when collectively creating complex phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.

It is analogous to saying that water molecules change their chemical composition (e.g., become two oxygens and one hydrogen) when enough of them come together, which is not how [[Emergent intelligence and selforganizing systems|emergence]] works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.

### Downward Causality
The concept of "downward causality" is acknowledged as real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>. This means that higher-level phenomena can influence lower-level components without violating fundamental physical laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. For example, if a decision is made to roll a stone down a hill, the electron orbitals within the stone will turn around, which they weren't doing before, due to the macro-level decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:41">[01:28:41]</a>.

Similarly, abstract concepts like "honor" or "Law and Order" have no physical reality at the micro-level, but they are [[Complexity and emergence in biological systems|emergent phenomena]] that can influence physical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>. These high-level abstractions can appear to cause highly improbable trajectories of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a>. However, this does not mean that the individual components themselves change or that one can "harness" them to make them work differently in a way that violates physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>. The argument against free will here still asks: "Where did the intent to do that come from in the first place?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a>.

## Consciousness
[[Consciousness and its origins|Consciousness]] is considered a fascinating but difficult subject, often leading to a "creepy and queasy" feeling due to its elusive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>. Despite its complexity, it is argued that [[Consciousness and Evolution|consciousness]] is largely irrelevant to the question of free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. Much of what [[Consciousness and its origins|consciousness]] does is to try and explain actions *after* they have occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>.

One conjecture posits that a "sliver of room for free will" might exist in the ability to consciously choose what one attends to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>. What a person attends to significantly influences who they become; for instance, attending to pornography versus Renaissance art will shape different individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>. While attention can sometimes be volitionally controlled, it is often automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:51">[01:32:51]</a>.

However, even this apparent "choice of attention" is dismissed as not demonstrating free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:21">[01:33:21]</a>. For example, encountering a smell from childhood can vividly evoke memories without conscious effort, due to the biological proximity of the olfactory system to the memory system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>. The associations made and their nature are not preventable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. The core argument remains: "Where did the intent to do that come from in the first place?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a> â€“ implying that all choices, even those related to attention, are products of prior circumstances and biological makeup.

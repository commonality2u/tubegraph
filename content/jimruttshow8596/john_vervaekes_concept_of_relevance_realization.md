The concept of [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance realization]] is central to John Vervaeke's work, particularly his "Awakening from the Meaning Crisis" series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[01:58]</a>. It is described as a fundamental cognitive process that helps agents navigate a complex and ever-changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Nature of Relevance Realization

Vervaeke emphasizes that [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance]] does not possess an essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>; rather, it is fundamentally a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This idea is influenced by Wittgenstein, who noted that many categories lack an essence in the Aristotelian sense (i.e., a set of necessary and sufficient conditions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, using the example of a "game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

While science aims to discover categories that *do* have essences (as argued by Quine, such as gold, which possesses stable, homogeneous, and intrinsic properties that support broad explanatory generalizations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance]] does not fit this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The things an individual finds relevant are not homogeneous (they can be big, small, fast, slow, near, far) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, nor are they stable (something relevant one second might be irrelevant the next) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Furthermore, [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance]] is not intrinsic to an object; it depends on the presence of organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Therefore, the brain does not discover the essence of [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Analogy to Darwinian Fitness

Vervaeke draws a strong analogy between [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance]] and Darwinian fitness (or "fittedness") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Similar to how there is no single essence to what makes an organism "fit" for survival (it could be bigness, smallness, speed, complexity, or simplicity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, there is no essence to [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This makes sense because the environment itself is dynamically complex and constantly changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Darwin did not propose a definition of fittedness but rather a universal process—evolution by natural selection—that continually redefines and redesigns it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Similarly, Vervaeke proposes that [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance realization]] occurs through a process where [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance]] is constantly evolving without a final definition or perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. It acts as a lens for maneuvering in a highly complex and co-evolutionary world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, serving as a key tool in human cognition for making sense of a combinatorially explosive and constantly changing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Connection to Meaning and Sacredness

[[Relevance Realization in Cognitive Science | Relevance realization]] is deeply connected to spirituality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a> and meaning in life. The "meaning in life" literature suggests that meaning is about the realization (awareness and actualization) of connectedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. If this connectedness is fundamentally our cognitive fittedness, then, like Darwinian fitness, there is no perfection or finality to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.

Vervaeke redefines sacredness as the "inexhaustibility of our reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. He proposes that spiritual experiences involve a profound enhancement of our [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance realization]] and connectedness to self, others, and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. The experience of sacredness involves an inexhaustibleness in the way more sense can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. When something affords an ongoing "fount of new intelligibility" in a relationship, it is found to be more meaningful, transformative, and spiritually deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.

## Relationship to Religio and Perennial Problems

[[Religio]], as defined by Vervaeke, is the realization (awareness and actualization) of the fundamental connectedness that is at the core of our cognitive agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:04">[02:11:04]</a>. A key feature of [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance realization]] is its inherent self-correction, recursively functioning upon itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:30">[02:11:30]</a>. Therefore, anything that corrects, improves, or enhances our [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance realization]] (and thus our realization of connectedness) is highly positive for us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:44">[02:11:44]</a>.

While [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance realization]] by itself can "run amok" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>, [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | religio]] acts as a cultural superstructure that guides, constrains, and "seduces" [[role_of_relevance_realization | relevance realization]] towards a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:31">[02:25:31]</a>. It is a "meta-meaningful system" that steers [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | religio]] away from foolishness and towards flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

[[Religio]] is positioned as a significant part of the answer to the perennial problems faced by humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>. These problems (such as modal confusion, absurdity, alienation, parasitic processing) arise from the very processes that make us adaptively fitted to our environment, also making us vulnerable to self-deceptive and self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:32">[02:23:32]</a>. Vervaeke argues that we need to cultivate ecologies of practices that address these perennial problems and enhance the connectedness at the core of meaning in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:51">[02:24:51]</a>.

## Role in Symbols

Symbols are viewed in a rich, literary sense, not just as mere signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:42">[02:24:42]</a>. Examples include the Christian cross or the American flag, which carry extensive nuance and influence how individuals perceive and interpret the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

Vervaeke asserts that symbols are culturally and cognitively indispensable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. Just as English is indispensable to his cognitive agency as a monolingual speaker, certain symbols are essential to an individual's or group's cognitive functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>. However, he distinguishes this from metaphysical necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. While a symbol might be indispensable to one, it is not metaphysically necessary for all cognitive agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. The conflation of cognitive indispensability with metaphysical necessity is a common issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.

In the context of [[Concept of effective value meme | mythos]], symbols are used to activate and augment our realization of [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | religio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. They help make us aware of and enhance our experience of connectedness, leading to an experience of sacredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This symbolic use aims to increase sapiential wisdom and integrate different kinds of knowing to enhance [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | religio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>.

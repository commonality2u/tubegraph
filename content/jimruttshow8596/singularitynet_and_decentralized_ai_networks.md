[[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI) expert Ben Goertzel leads SingularityNET, a [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_communication | distributed network]] that enables individuals to create, share, and monetize AI services at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This project embodies Goertzel's long-standing vision for distributed, autonomous AI agents cooperating to achieve emergent intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.

## Vision and Structure
SingularityNET functions as a "society of minds" or an "economy of mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. In this system, AI agents can pay each other for services, or be paid by external entities for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>. This economic aspect is crucial for credit assignment and value assessment within the network, and it serves as another approach to achieving emergent [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] where loosely coupled agents can still manifest cognitive dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

The platform utilizes blockchain technology as its underlying "plumbing" to facilitate interactions among [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] agents without a central controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. This fosters a heterogeneously controlled and participatory democratic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.

## Importance of Decentralization
A key aspect of SingularityNET is its role as an ecosystem not controlled by dominant corporations, acting as a counter-trend to the increasing concentration of [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] progress in fewer hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>. The importance of a [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_communication | decentralized network]] and open approach to [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] is multi-faceted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>:
*   It can enable [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] to contribute more positively to the world, contrasting with the "selling, spying, killing, and gambling" focus often seen in centralized [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.
*   If current narrow [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AIs]] evolve into [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AGI]], it's preferable for them to be engaged in compassionate and creative endeavors like education, disease research, science, elder care, and art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

The current hegemonic situation in [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] is largely due to self-organizing socio-economic dynamics and powerful network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. Companies that succeed first with narrow [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AIs]] for rapid deployment accumulate significant financial resources, data for training, and processing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. SingularityNET aims to leverage these same network effects as a double-sided platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.

Just as Linux didn't completely obsolete Apple or Microsoft but became dominant in mobile operating systems and servers, a [[decentralized_networks_for_ai_communication | decentralized AI network]] could have a tremendous impact without necessarily displacing the big tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy
To achieve critical mass and initiate the two-sided market cycle, SingularityNET is focusing on building the demand side of the market first, while initially training the supply internally with its own [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.

Key strategies include:
*   **AI Developer Workshops and Requests:** Conducting workshops and placing requests for [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] on the platform, incentivizing new [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] contributions with tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.
*   **Singularity Studio:** A for-profit company spun off to build commercial products, starting with FinTech, on top of the SingularityNET platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. Licensing fees from these products will be converted into [[economic_transactions_in_ai_systems | AGI]] tokens, driving the token-based market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.
*   **SingularityNET X-Lab Accelerator:** This accelerator recruits community projects to build software products using [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] from SingularityNET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. These projects are supported with tokens, publicity, and [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.

The goal is to achieve significant utilization of the [[economic_transactions_in_ai_systems | AGI]] token, attracting both the blockchain and [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. This will incentivize more developers to contribute their [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_vs_narrow_ai | AI]] to the platform, offering a market of paying customers in addition to the project's inherent democratic and decentralized appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.

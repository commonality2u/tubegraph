The discussion on consciousness often extends to understanding [[higher_states_of_consciousness_and_their_perception_as_more_real | higher states of consciousness]] (HSCs) and their perceived reality compared to everyday experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. While some traditions, particularly religious philosophies like Buddhism and Taoism, consider HSCs as "more real" and capable of profound individual transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, a more neutral term, "altered states of consciousness," might be preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Perception of Reality in Altered States
Unlike dreams, which are often strange but not generally considered more real or coherently integrable with one's worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, [[higher_states_of_consciousness_and_their_perception_as_more_real | higher states of consciousness]] can be unique and ineffable yet lead individuals to judge them as being "of what's really real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This perception of hyper-vividness or pretentiousness in an altered state might not, however, lead to a more accurate modeling of reality for everyday navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

## Phenomenology vs. Functionality
A crucial distinction is made between the altered *phenomenology* (the subjective experience) and the underlying *functionality* of these states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. While the phenomenology can be fascinating, the true value lies in the increased capacity for insight they afford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Insights gained can be profound, systemic, and lead to breakthroughs across whole areas of endeavor or even one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

> "It's not altered states of consciousness that matters, it's altered traits of character." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>
> "The problem with the fixation on the phenomenology is it tends to enhance... spiritual narcissism... and also spiritual bypassing, escaping from reality into this wonderful phenomenology." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>

## Fluency, Insight, and Flow States
The concept of [[human performance and flow states | fluency]] is central to understanding insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. In psychology, fluency refers to the brain's use of processing ease to make judgments about information content, often equating ease with trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. More profoundly, fluency is seen as the brain achieving an "optimal grip" on a situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

Insight involves a sudden shift from a non-optimal to an optimal grip on a problem, accompanied by a flash of vividness or "more realness," metaphorically represented by a light bulb going on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. When a series of insights are chained together, such as in improvisational jazz, it leads to a [[human performance and flow states | flow state]], an "extended aha experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

### The Continuity Hypothesis
This leads to the "continuity hypothesis," which proposes a progression from [[human performance and flow states | fluency]] to insight, to [[human performance and flow states | flow states]], to [[Mystical Experiences and their effects | mystical experiences]], and ultimately to transformative experiences, all utilizing the same underlying machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. A [[Mystical Experiences and their effects | mystical experience]] is theorized as a [[human performance and flow states | flow state]] where the capacity being exercised is an optimal grip on the world or reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. This offers a "meta-stance" towards the world, analogous to a martial arts stance that prepares for any optimal action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

## De-centering and Insight
A significant benefit of altered states of consciousness is [[relevance_of_spirituality_and_altered_states_in_metamodernism | de-centering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. This refers to the process of moving beyond egocentrism, making one more "world-centric" (onto-centric) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. Just as children are more egocentric than adults, adults can be egocentric compared to a "sage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>. Egocentrism drives many cognitive biases like confirmation bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.

> The "Solomon effect" is a practical example of de-centering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. By re-describing a personal problem from a third-person perspective (as if a friend were talking about it), individuals can gain insights they wouldn't access from a first-person perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.
> [[Mystical Experiences and their effects | Mystical experiences]], by radically re-centering individuals and making "realness" salient, weaken the "blinding glare of the ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>. Similarly, [[human performance and flow states | flow states]] reduce the "nattering nanny manager ego," demonstrating that agency can be enhanced without constant egoic oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

## The Role of Community and Tradition
Engaging with altered states of consciousness, particularly psychedelics, necessitates embedding these experiences within an ecology of practices and a community that has some kind of tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. This is because collective cognition generally outperforms individual cognition, helping to overcome individual biases like confirmation bias through mutual correction and shared intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.

When one messes with their "salience landscape" through these experiences, it opens them up powerfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>. A "perennial" corrective is to regularly and reliably subject personal revelations to the witnessing and critique of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>. This "inter-subjective collective verification" is akin to how science works and how face-to-face communities operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>.

## Complexification and Emergence
The concept of "complexification" describes a system that is simultaneously differentiating and integrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:14:00">[26:14:00]</a>. This process produces [[Emergence of Mind | emergence]], allowing a system to perform more actions in a coordinated manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>. The brain is an example of a complex system that integrates and differentiates at multiple levels of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.

When the process of complexification is coupled with the complexity of the world, an individual can increasingly fit the world's complexity by appropriately complexifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>. Many contemporary problems arise from attempting to address complex phenomena with merely complicated (flow-chart mechanistic) solutions, rather than recognizing and engaging with emergent complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Parasitic Processing
Buddhist practices, such as the Eightfold Path, can be understood as a means to combat "parasitic processing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>. Parasitic processing occurs when individually adaptive heuristics (like confirmation bias or availability heuristic) self-organize and mutually reinforce each other, leading to anxiety or depression spirals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>. These "sprialling" patterns feed on themselves, sucking life from the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:44:00">[31:44:00]</a>.

Such self-deceptive, self-destructive behaviors, built from adaptive machinery, are resistant to direct intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>. The genius of the Buddha, it is argued, was to create "counteractive dynamical systems" – ecologies of practices that intervene at multiple points and levels in a parallel fashion to dismantle these maladaptive patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>. This model of parasitic processing helps define "foolishness" (as opposed to mere ignorance) and, conversely, "wisdom" as the cultivation of such ecologies of practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>.

The Buddhist concept of *dukkha*, often translated as "suffering," is reinterpreted not as mere pain or distress, but as a "loss of agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>. Parables used to describe dukkha often emphasize self-entrapment and a loss of freedom, rather than physical pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. The Buddha's teaching, in this view, offers the "taste of freedom" – the recovery and restoration of agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>. Ignorance is considered a primary mark of dukkha because it profoundly diminishes agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>.

## Introduction to Dave Snowden
Dave Snowden is the founder and chief scientific officer of Cognitive Edge, with international work covering government and industry related to strategy, organizational design, and [[Systems thinking and decision making | decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He has pioneered a science-based approach, drawing on anthropology, neuroscience, and [[Complex adaptive systems theory | complex adaptive systems theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Snowden is known for his pragmatic cynicism and classic style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. He is also affiliated with the University of Pretoria, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and the University of Warwick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Snowden is best known as the inventor of the Cynefin framework, pronounced "can-ev-in" (Welsh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. His early work at IBM in knowledge management led him to understand that [[Systems thinking and decision making | decision support]] is more [[Distinguishing complex systems from complicated systems | complex]] than simply codifying information into databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This led to his work on narrative and [[Complex systems and the emergence of order | complexity theory]], and involvement in DARPA programs focusing on weak signal detection and [[Systems thinking and decision making | decision-making]] in [[Complex systems and societal evolution | complex policy environments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## The Cynefin Framework
The Cynefin framework is based on a fundamental division into three main types of systems: ordered, complex, and chaotic, with phase shifts between them rather than mere gradations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. A central "disorder" domain represents the state of not knowing which system type one is in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The essence of Cynefin is that [[The role of context and constraints in complex systems | context is key]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, challenging the idea of universal management fads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. It helps decide what [[The role of context and constraints in complex systems | context]] you're in before choosing a method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Naïve Newtonianism and Causality
A common mistake in business and government is "naïve Newtonianism," which assumes that with enough data, the future can be predicted, ignoring concepts like deterministic chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Many still take a linear approach to causality, assuming that if inputs are right, outputs can be defined or forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. [[Complex systems and the emergence of order | Complexity theory]], distinct from deterministic chaos, is described as the "science for uncertainty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It allows understanding the present and mapping coherent pathways from it, but not defining a future outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

The Cynefin framework acknowledges that highly predictable Newtonian systems can be created, like traffic management or operating theaters, but they are not universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Ordered Systems
Ordered systems are characterized by a very high level of constraint, making everything predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Humans use constraints to create predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

1.  **Obvious (or Simple)**: In this domain, the relationship between cause and effect is self-evident and understood by everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This is the domain of best practice, where there is a single right way of doing things. The process is to sense, categorize, and respond, operating under rigid constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
2.  **Complicated**: Here, cause and effect may be obvious to experts but not to the decision-maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. It requires investigation and expertise, following a sense, analyze, respond approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. There is a right answer that can be discovered, possibly within a range of possibilities, leading to "good practice" rather than "best practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. An example is a medical practitioner having flexibility in patient decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Over-constraining an ordered system can cause it to break or fragment into chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### [[Complex systems and their properties | Complex Systems]]
A [[Complex systems and their properties | complex system]] has "enabling constraints," where everything is interconnected, but the connections are not fully known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. A "dark constraint" concept, analogous to dark energy, describes seeing the impact of something without knowing its source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

In a [[Complex adaptive systems theory | complex adaptive system]], understanding requires probing and experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Critically, experiments must be run in parallel, especially when evidence supports conflicting hypotheses of action that cannot be resolved within the decision timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. In Cynefin, instead of trying to resolve conflicts, "safe-to-fail micro-experiments" are constructed around each coherent hypothesis and run in parallel, allowing solutions to emerge as dynamics change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Chaotic Systems
Chaos is defined in social science as the absence of constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. While in physics this is a low-energy gradient, in human systems it's a high-energy gradient because human systems are open and constraints form quickly and naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. Chaos is always temporary; one doesn't want to accidentally fall into it but may deliberately enter it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. To deal with a truly chaotic system, the guidance is to create constraints rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

### Disorder
This is the central domain in Cynefin, representing the state of not knowing which of the other system types one is in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Entering it can be accidental or deliberate, but it is a type of inauthenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:12:02]</a>. For example, a bureaucratic tendency might impose order inappropriately, while a tendency towards [[Complex systems and the emergence of order | complexity]] might fail to impose order when appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## [[Distinguishing complex systems from complicated systems | Complicated vs. Complex Systems]]
A key distinction is:
*   A **complicated system** is the sum of its parts; problems can be solved by breaking things down and solving them separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Complicated systems tend to be engineered and their components are not "antagonistically adaptive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   In a **[[Complex systems and their properties | complex system]]**, the properties of the whole result from interaction between the parts, their linkages, and constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. How things connect is more important than what they are, meaning emergent patterns cannot be decomposed to their original parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. In a [[Complex adaptive systems theory | complex adaptive system]], what was beneficial one day can change (e.g., symbiosis evolving from parasitism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

Complicated systems can be embedded in [[Complex systems and their properties | complex systems]], for instance, a factory (complicated) operating within a marketplace of suppliers, customers, and competitors (complex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Conversely, [[Complex systems and their properties | complex systems]] can be embedded in complicated ones, as seen with populist political movements creating micro-complexity within an overarching, easily managed political framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## Applications and Related Concepts

### Apex Predator Theory and Populism
This theory states that when something becomes commoditized, frequency variety is lost, the system becomes perverse, and something new can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. For example, when hardware and then software became commodities, new entities (Microsoft, Apple/Google) dominated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:18:15]</a>. Politically, neoliberalism homogenized the left and right, causing people to feel they lacked choice, which lowered the energy cost for extremists to gain influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The concern is that new "predators" (like populism) can stabilize a new ecosystem that is difficult to disrupt for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

The rise of populism, exacerbated by social media's positive feedback loops, can create perverse situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. Solutions involve introducing human agency that is horizontally and bottom-up mediated into social media to increase empathy and human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. This means focusing on low-grade, low-level human interaction and systems that support it, rather than expecting grand schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

### Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation
Agent-based models and simulations are useful if there is single agency and clear rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. However, most human systems deal with multiple identities and patterns beyond rule-based decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. The danger is confusing simulation with prediction, similar to confusing correlation with causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. Murray Gell-Mann famously stated that the only valid model of a human system is the system itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. While agent-based modeling can offer insight and clues, it doesn't provide the predictive element often sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

In social systems, one should not take a single trajectory from an agent-based model as a prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. However, the statistics on the ensemble of trajectories can be very interesting, revealing whether a system is in a Gaussian or "fat-tailed" (extremistan) space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:29:02]</a>. Managing in these different spaces requires different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. In Pareto distributions (fat-tailed), the best approach is to "trigger" human beings to a heightened state of alert to look at something, rather than predicting specific outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

### Human Agency and Cognitive Diversity
Human beings are good at chaos, having evolved for it, particularly for collective [[Systems thinking and decision making | decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. There is a large gap between what AIs can do and what humans can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. The risk is that current AI work may reduce human intelligence and capability rather than augmenting it, by forcing humans into rigid processes and structured approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.

A key recommendation for designing systems is to increase human agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:26]</a>. This involves empowering people to assess situations, which creates training datasets that can then be used by AI systems, ensuring traceability and understanding of the mechanism for decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:40]</a>.

### Ethics and Aesthetics in AI Design
For better AI and human systems, three areas are crucial:
1.  **Ethics**: Engineers should have basic training in ethics from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
2.  **Aesthetics**: Understanding aesthetics, which is about abstractions, is important for effective [[Systems thinking and decision making | decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:40:00]</a>. Music and language evolve from abstractions, allowing for rapid "exaptive thinking" (repurposing things) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:22]</a>. Abstraction also fosters higher empathy than material things, as parables offer better moral guidance than values or principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:39]</a>.
3.  **Epigenetics**: Understanding the mechanism for cultural inheritance within a single generation is crucial for designing tools that augment human intelligence and capability, rather than reducing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:42:27]</a>.

### Narrative and SenseMaker®
Narrative is central to Snowden's work. The idea is that "we always know more than we can say" and "we can always say more than we can write" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>. To understand what's truly happening, one needs "watercooler stories" – day-to-day micro-narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.

**SenseMaker®** is a software platform designed to gather these day-to-day micro-narratives (or "micro observations") and allow individuals to self-interpret them, rather than relying on interpretation by text search, algorithms, or experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. This allows for scaling to very high volumes rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>. Narrative carries ambiguity, sitting between explicit data (like a map) and tacit knowledge (like a taxi driver's intuition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>.

SenseMaker® replaces traditional surveys (e.g., employee satisfaction) by asking non-hypothesis questions (e.g., "What story would you tell your best friend if they were offered a job in your workplace?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Individuals then self-interpret their stories by positioning them on a series of "triangles" (triads) or other graphical forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>. This process adds metadata to the original narrative, which is then analyzed to draw "fitness landscapes" showing patterns, including dominant and outlier views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:56]</a>. The original narrative is carried with the statistical data to explain what the patterns mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:03:00]</a>. This self-scoring allows for instant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:29]</a>.

SenseMaker® can be used to:
*   Map organizational culture for mergers and acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
*   Provide distributed [[Systems thinking and decision making | decision support]] by presenting ambiguous situations to thousands of employees for interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.
*   Identify outlier views in an organization, as these individuals think differently about problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   Measure attitudes (e.g., to cybersecurity, ethics, customer purchasing behavior) as early indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:56]</a>.
*   Facilitate "site casting" – understanding what is possible in the present before risking the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:23]</a>.
*   Encourage [[Scaffolding and its function within cognitive and dynamic systems | coherent heterogeneity]] (diversity that can come together in different ways) and identify useful dissent by statistically mapping narratives and testing for coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   Act as a replacement for political polling to discover shared values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:56]</a>.
*   Empower individuals (e.g., social work clients, 16-year-olds as ethnographers) to tell and interpret their own stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:42]</a>.

### Management Implications ([[Complexity science in organizational context | Complexity Science in Organizational Context]])
*   **Multifaceted Leadership**: There isn't one universal leadership style; different styles (e.g., servant leadership, draconian leadership) work in different [[The role of context and constraints in complex systems | contexts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:50]</a>. Leadership should be distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:55]</a>.
*   **Attitudes as Early Indicators**: Attitudes are more important than compliance because they are early indicators of dispositional states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:46:56]</a>.
*   **Contextual Appropriateness**: Understanding the domain one is in is crucial, as there is no single answer to every problem ([[no free lunch theorem]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:31]</a>. Management fads often lack a scientific base and claim universal solutions that don't exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:22]</a>.
*   **Embracing Diversity and Dissent**: Organizations should shift from homogeneity to "[[Scaffolding and its function within cognitive and dynamic systems | coherent heterogeneity]]" to maintain resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:48:16]</a>. This means maintaining diversity without being overwhelmed by "crankery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:27]</a>. By running safe-to-fail experiments based on clustered outlier views, one can determine which ideas are coherent and worth exploring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:50:02]</a>. There is an optimal level of dissent to maintain within an organization for effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:15]</a>.
*   **Knowing When to Switch**: In an evolutionary context, stable times call for exploitation, while unstable times require more exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:50]</a>. AI can be used to "trigger" when to switch between these two modes before it's too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:53:08]</a>. This is achieved by building human-mediated training datasets that executive buy-in ensures trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:31]</a>.
*   **Downward Causality**: In [[Complex systems and their properties | complex systems]], behavior at lower levels can be highly constrained by emergent higher-level structures, illustrating a form of "downward causality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:20]</a>. However, one cannot extrapolate from chemical reactions to human systems due to multiple levels of emergence and greater uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:56:06]</a>.
*   **Red Teams and Ritual Dissent**: While red teams are valuable if truly independent, a technique called "ritual dissent" fragments into multiple small "micro red teams" to examine [[Systems thinking and decision making | decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:24]</a>.

## Current and Future Work
Snowden's work is increasingly focused on democracy, education, and creating a more humane society under conditions of control and restraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:20]</a>. This involves taking a natural science approach to social systems, using natural science to constrain what is possible in social systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:11:01]</a>. This contrasts with case-based inductive social science, which is often self-referential, politically influenced, and focused on prediction where it is not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:10:36]</a>.

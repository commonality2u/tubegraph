The [[2024_us_presidential_election_and_thirdparty_candidates | 2024 US Presidential Election]] has brought to the forefront discussions about the [[role_of_race_and_gender_in_political_campaigns | role of race and gender in political campaigns]], particularly concerning the Democratic Party's strategy and the electorate's response.

## Gender and Masculinity in the Campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>

The conversation highlighted a perception of gender playing a significant role in the current election, specifically referencing a Democratic Party commercial featuring "manly men" discussing what it means to be a man and implying that voting for Kamala Harris demonstrates not being afraid of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.

### The Evolution of Feminism and its Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>
The discussion traced the concept of feminism, distinguishing between:
*   **First-wave feminism**: Seen as a noble pursuit, focusing on equal opportunity and keeping qualified women from positions of power due to traditional divisions of labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>.
*   **Second-wave feminism**: Described as sensible, exemplified by the idea that women capable of meeting existing standards, such as a Marine Corps infantry officer, should be welcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>.
*   **Radical feminism today**: Criticized for asserting that certain outcomes (e.g., 50/50 representation) must exist, and if not, it indicates "institutional sexism or some hor***t like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. This modern interpretation is believed to have led to an "overthrow of masculinity," which is deemed a mistake because masculinity is a "fundamental part of humans" and civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>.

The hosts expressed concerns that the Democratic Party has become an "incoherently feminine quadrant of the electorate" by synonymizing masculinity with "toxic masculinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. This perspective suggests that men voting for the Democratic Party are "falling down on their obligations as men" by subordinating themselves to ideas considered "flat out wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>. It is argued that this has led to "defections" among men who "aren't going to put up with the idea that all morally right men are going to vote for an apparently empty headed candidate simply because that candidate is female" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>.

## Race and Identity in the Campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>

The discussion highlighted the role of [[race_and_identity_in_america | race and identity in America]] within the Democratic Party's strategy, particularly concerning Kamala Harris's candidacy.

### Kamala Harris's Candidacy and Identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>
Kamala Harris's candidacy is presented as an example where identity characteristics were prioritized. Despite being described as a "lightweight" and giving off a "vibe that gives many of us the Willies," it was noted that "what she's got going for her is that she's phenotypically attracted female and some version of not white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:03]</a>. The idea that "the most powerful Nation on Earth is going to elect somebody purely based on those identitarian characteristics is frightening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.

### Black Men and the Democratic Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>
Concerns were raised about black men, with polling showing approximately 25% potentially voting for the Republican Party, which would be unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>. This shift is seen as a "massive political realignment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>. A specific incident where Joe Biden implied that if one is not voting for him, "then you're not really black," was cited as an "obscene stupid and insulting Distortion" and a "red pill moment" for people of integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>. This tactic, reminiscent of past criticisms against figures like Clarence Thomas, is seen as the Democratic Party's attempt to label those who deviate from expected political alignment as "traitors to the black race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>.

## Criticism of Identity Politics and the Democratic Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>

The hosts argue that the Democratic Party is overly reliant on [[liberalism_versus_identity_politics_and_social_justice | identity politics]]. Jim Rut outlines his reasons for disliking the Democratic Party, including:
*   **Oikophobia**: "Hatred of your culture," leading college students and some polled data to suggest a dislike for American society and Enlightenment values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>.
*   **Rising Anti-Semitism**: Citing Harvard polling data showing 65% of 18 to 25-year-olds agreeing that "Jews are oppressors," contrasting sharply with 8% of Boomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>. This is attributed to "indoctrination by the blue church wokeness and neotribalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>. This reflects broader [[critical_theory_and_race_gender_and_identity_discussions | critical theory and race, gender, and identity discussions]].
*   **Hamas supporters**: Expressing dismay at "Hamas lovers" within the party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>.

The discussion implies that this focus on [[liberalism_versus_identity_politics_and_social_justice | identity politics]] and perceived cultural grievances contributes to the Democratic Party's challenges in appealing to a broader base, particularly working-class men and some minority groups. The shift in the Republican Party's constituency, absorbing "politically homeless" working-class people, further underscores the impact of these dynamics on the overall [[impact_of_culture_and_ideology_on_elections | election landscape]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>.

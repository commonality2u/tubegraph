The relationship between [[meaning_crisis_and_wisdom | wisdom]], [[intelligence_and_rationality | rationality]], and virtue is crucial for individual and collective flourishing. These concepts are deeply interconnected and mutually supporting, forming a core aspect of addressing human challenges like self-deception and foolishness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:40">[01:35:40]</a>.

## Re-evaluating Rationality and Wisdom
Historically, particularly in "Enlightenment 1.0," the notion of [[intelligence_and_rationality | rationality]] was often reduced to inferential propositional [[intelligence_and_rationality | rationality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>. This perspective is considered inadequate because many forms of self-deception are not related to inferential practices, but rather to intentional practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>. A more comprehensive understanding emphasizes that [[meaning_crisis_and_wisdom | wisdom]] should make individuals both "more insightfully rational and more rationally insightful" in a systematic and systemic way, affecting both individual and collective agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:22">[01:37:22]</a>.

It is important to distinguish between [[intelligence_and_rationality | intelligence]] and [[intelligence_and_rationality | rationality]]:
*   [[intelligence_and_rationality | Intelligence]] (g, or IQ) is largely fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>.
*   [[intelligence_and_rationality | Rationality]] is highly malleable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>.

[[intelligence_and_rationality | Intelligence]] is a necessary but not sufficient condition for [[intelligence_and_rationality | rationality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:21">[01:43:21]</a>. There is substantial experimental evidence that [[intelligence_and_rationality | rationality]] can be significantly improved, leading to a reduction in self-deceptive foolishness and an enhancement of connectedness to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>. People often conflate [[intelligence_and_rationality | rationality]], logicality, and [[intelligence_and_rationality | intelligence]], but they are distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:41">[01:43:41]</a>.

## The Role of Virtue
[[meaning_crisis_and_wisdom | Wisdom]] and virtue are deeply intertwined with [[intelligence_and_rationality | rationality]]. The cultivation of intellectual virtues is essential, even in scientific endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. For instance, a scientist needs to balance humility against courage when defending a theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:18">[01:39:18]</a>. There's no algorithm for this; it requires virtuous judgment, such as the "golden mean" between perseverance and humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>. Scientists should exemplify intellectual virtues like being open to self-correction and external criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>.

## Active Open-Mindedness
A key cognitive style that links these concepts is **active open-mindedness** (AOM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:54">[01:44:54]</a>. AOM is a practice akin to Stoicism and can help combat common cognitive biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:58">[01:44:58]</a>.

One way to practice AOM:
1.  **Identify a cognitive bias**: Choose a specific bias (e.g., confirmation bias) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:32">[01:45:32]</a>.
2.  **Observe in others**: Practice recognizing this bias in other people, as this is often easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>.
3.  **Self-reflection**: Turn those honed observation skills on oneself to catch personal instances of the bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:56">[01:45:56]</a>.
4.  **Active counteraction**: Deliberately act against the bias. For example, if prone to confirmation bias, actively seek evidence that could falsify one's propositions or ask others for potential criticisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>.

This practice cultivates epistemic humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>.

Another form of AOM is **steel-manning** an opponent's argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:36">[01:47:36]</a>. This involves summarizing another person's position, especially one you disagree with, in its strongest possible formulation, demonstrating that you understand it thoroughly before offering criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:51">[01:47:51]</a>. Beyond just summarizing, AOM involves "dialogical movement" â€“ genuinely moving towards the other person's position with integrity as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:08">[01:48:08]</a>. This encourages reciprocal movement and fosters genuine collaborative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a>.

> "When two people are engaged together in thinking, [it] is a dance of active open-mindedness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.

The goal of such dialectical engagement is not necessarily agreement, but for both participants to reach a place of "rational insight" they couldn't have achieved on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>. This emphasizes focusing on the process of thinking rather than just the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:27">[01:52:27]</a>.

## Holistic Development
Ultimately, the goal is to couple [[meaning_crisis_and_wisdom | wisdom]] and "enlightenment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:21">[01:36:21]</a>. This involves creating "ecologies of practices" that provide tools for "wise enlightenment" by cultivating individuals who are "insightfully rational and rationally insightful" in a profoundly developmental and transformative way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a>. This holistic approach aims to achieve "systematic seeing through illusion and into reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>.

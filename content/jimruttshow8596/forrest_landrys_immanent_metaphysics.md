Forrest Landry's work, referred to as "[[immanent_metaphysics | Immanent Philosophy]]" or "[[immanent_metaphysics | Immanent Metaphysics]]" (spelled I-M-M-A-N-E-N-T), is a deep dive into foundational ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Unlike some philosophical traditions, it is not about making up beliefs or asking for faith, but rather a serious attempt to build an understanding of the universe from basic fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The website version of Landry's work is considered more readable and advanced than his book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Why [[immanent_metaphysics | Immanent Metaphysics]]?

Landry undertakes this work to address important choices in the world today, including [[ethics_and_metaphysics | existential risk]] and civilization design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. These areas relate to [[ethics_and_metaphysics | ethical concerns]] and values, necessitating an understanding of the [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | nature of choice]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The goal is to develop a sensible, grounded, and functional approach to choice-making at community levels, which requires clear concepts of goodness, choice, and a basic methodology for knowing anything at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This work aims to enable better design and choice-making, both individually and collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

## Definition of [[immanent_metaphysics | Metaphysics]]

Landry defines [[immanent_metaphysics | metaphysics]] more crisply and narrowly than the historical philosophical tradition, which often delves into theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. He views it as an inquiry into the [[nature_of_reality_and_perception | nature of the relation between self and reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, or more briefly, the interaction between the subjective and the objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

Historically, metaphysics addresses two primary questions: "What is?" (ontology, study of existence and being) and "How do we know?" (epistemology, nature of knowledge and consciousness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Other branches, like axiology (what's valuable) and aesthetics (what's beautiful), extend from this metaphysical premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. Landry asserts that the relationship between the subjective and objective is real, forming the basis for understanding [[nature_of_reality_and_perception | perception]] and [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

Instead of prioritizing the perceived (objective) or the perceiver (subjective), Landry considers the *process* of perceiving as more fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. This means ontology and epistemology are attached to perceiving itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. He distinguishes between "exist," "be real," and "be objective," noting that these are three distinct claims often overlapped in philosophical literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. The relationship between the subjective and objective is treated as its own ontological class, more fundamental than either the perceiver or the perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

## Key Concepts

### Self

In Landry's work, "self" is defined as the product of all choices one has made and all choices one *could* make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. This encompasses memory (past choices) and capabilities (future choices), viewed as a product space that increases dimensionality by including both actuality and potentiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. The notion of self is characterized in terms of [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]], similar to how causation characterizes the objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.

### Interaction vs. Relation

Landry distinguishes between relation and interaction:
*   **Relation:** A-temporal, without time. Mathematics, for example, studies structures of relationships without requiring a temporal element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>. If a mathematical proof is true, it is always true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a>. Mathematics is seen as the study of pure relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>.
*   **Interaction:** Inherently has a temporal element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>. This includes the flow of information from the objective to the subjective, as in scientific experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:00">[32:14:00]</a>. Interaction implies concepts like temporality, information flow, and alternative possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. Landry posits that an observer is implied in the notion of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:00">[34:46:00]</a>. He argues that interaction is more fundamental than the notion of existence, as one must interact to verify existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>.

### Reifying Power

"Reifying power" refers to the ability of concepts to clarify vague relationships and make them more distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:44:00">[52:44:00]</a>. It's about taking a vague idea and giving it more structure or definiteness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:00">[51:50:00]</a>. Landry uses "reifying power" in a positive sense, as a measure of how useful a concept or metaphysics is in gaining understanding and making better choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:19:00">[57:19:00]</a>. A powerful metaphor, for instance, connects widely disconnected concepts strongly and immediately, increasing insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:40:00">[54:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:03:00">[55:03:00]</a>. This allows for constructing the "power of metaphor" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>. The "incommensuration theorem" and [[ethics_and_metaphysics | ethics]] are examples of concepts demonstrating this reifying power in his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:19:00">[51:19:00]</a>.

## [[Nature of Reality and Perception | Perception]] and [[Nature of Reality and Perception | Reality]]

[[Nature of Reality and Perception | Perception]] doesn't necessarily provide perfect information about what is perceived or the perceiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Landry argues that of the three phenomena — perceiver, perceived, and perceiving — perception can only truly perceive the perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. He contrasts with Kant, who rejected metaphysics because perception couldn't give perfect information about the objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. For Landry, the perception *is* real, and the perceived is something we come to know *through* the vehicle of perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>. He suggests that interaction is more fundamental than existence, as establishing existence requires perception, which is a type of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>.

## Mind and Brain

In addressing the relationship between mind and brain, Landry notes that neuroscience explores neural correlates, showing a correspondence between subjective experience and brain tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. However, even perfected knowledge of these correlations wouldn't answer the "hard problem" of consciousness: *why* is this moment *this* one, or why is there any experience now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>? Correlation doesn't explain causation or distinguish between past, present, and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>.

Landry agrees that consciousness is a process, but emphasizes the need for a different toolset to address the "hard problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. He views "process" as the single most primal concept, with "interaction" as its atomic constituent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Process can be conceived in terms of patterns in space, force in time, and probability in possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.

For Landry, consciousness is intrinsically bound to the concepts of time and "hard random" (potentiality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:06">[01:21:06]</a>. The fact of a subjective experience is directly connected to temporality, process, and the possibility of other things having happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>. The "hard problem" remains because physicalist theories don't provide tools for the symmetry breaking that localizes consciousness to a specific place, moment, and possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:14">[01:22:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>. While the scientific method explains moving from a first-person perspective to a third-person understanding, the reverse — how to get a first-person perspective from a third-person orientation — requires a different kind of conceptual toolset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>.

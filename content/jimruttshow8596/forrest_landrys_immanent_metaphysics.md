Forrest Landry's work, which he calls [[immanent_metaphysics_and_its_concepts | Immanent Philosophy]], is a deep exploration into understanding the universe from fundamental principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Unlike common interpretations of metaphysics that might involve faith or subjective beliefs, Landry's approach is a serious attempt to build foundational understandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Purpose of [[immanent_metaphysics_and_its_concepts | Immanent Metaphysics]]

Landry undertakes this work to address important choices facing the world today, such as existential risk and civilization design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. These areas relate to ethical concerns and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. The core goal is to understand the nature of choice and how choices are made, including whether choice itself is real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This understanding is crucial for effective choice-making at community levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The aim is to "do better design" and "do better choice-making individually and collectively" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

## Defining Metaphysics

Landry defines metaphysics more narrowly and crisply than the historical philosophical tradition, which often linked it to theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. His domain for metaphysics is "an inquiry into the nature of the relation between [[self_and_reality_in_metaphysical_studies | self and reality]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>, specifically "the interaction between the subjective and the objective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

Historically, metaphysics addresses two primary questions:
*   **What is?** This delves into the study of [[existence_and_the_nature_of_reality | existence]] and ontology (the nature of being) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
*   **How do we know?** This concerns the nature of knowledge and epistemology (the phenomenology of consciousness and perception) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

Landry's work maintains a deep relationship with these historical ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. He posits that the relationship between the subjective and the objective is real and fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. This relationship, or "perceiving" itself, is considered more fundamental than the "perceiver" (subjective) and the "perceived" (objective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

### Distinctions of Reality
Landry distinguishes between the notions of "to exist," "to be real," and "to be objective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:01]</a>. These are three distinct claims, and some things that are real may not exist, and some objective things may not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. For Landry, the interaction is more fundamental than the notion of [[existence_and_the_nature_of_reality | existence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>.

## Concept of Self

The [[self_and_reality_in_metaphysical_studies | Self]], in Landry's work, is defined as "the product of all the choices you have made and all the choices you could make" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. This seemingly obscure definition proves to have significant utility for downstream concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>. This definition incorporates both actuality (what has been) and potentiality (what could be), effectively "your memory plus your capabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.

## [[metaphysics_and_its_relation_to_scientific_concepts | Metaphysics and Science]]

Landry's metaphysics is relevant to scientific concepts, particularly in how it frames the understanding of theories.

### Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity
Landry prefers interpretations of quantum mechanics that focus on the notion of measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. He views quantum mechanics as understanding the relationship between the space of possibility/probability and the space of forces in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>. This contrasts with general relativity, which conceives things in terms of patterns (mass in space) influencing force and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. The differing ways these theories conceive of time and force contribute to their current irreconcilability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>.

Landry suggests that [[metaphysics and its relation to scientific concepts | metaphysics]] can provide clear concepts that can be used by science, particularly physics and computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.

### Metaphysics, Physics, and Mathematics
Landry differentiates the roles of these fields:
*   **Physics** answers "why" questions through modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.
*   **Metaphysics** answers "what" questions through a descriptive process, providing a toolkit for clear concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:00">[22:58:00]</a>.
*   **Mathematics** creates toolsets for applied uses, exploring relationships and concepts for their own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>.

### Soundness vs. Validity
Landry highlights two types of "proof":
*   **Validity:** This is found in mathematics and logic, proving whether concepts are derived from other concepts within a formal system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>.
*   **Soundness:** This is a practical, not provable, concept. It assesses the correspondence between a mathematical model and a real-world domain, showing where applicability occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:12:00">[46:12:00]</a>. Landry is more interested in questions of soundness for metaphysics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:28:00">[46:28:00]</a>.

### Reifying Power
[[Immanent Metaphysics and its Concepts â€“ Link name: immanent_metaphysics_and_its_concepts]] aims to have "reifying power," which means clarifying vague relationships into more definite, structured forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:00">[51:50:00]</a>. It's about increasing usefulness and trustworthiness, allowing models from one domain to clarify the structure of models in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:18:00">[55:18:00]</a>. Landry views his metaphysics as having the strongest level of reifying power observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:08:00">[50:08:00]</a>.

## Core Concepts of [[immanent_metaphysics_and_its_concepts | Immanent Metaphysics]]

### Choice
The inherent nature of choice is a central concept. Anything intrinsic to the nature of choice is applicable to every choice made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>. Just as causation has coherence, choice also has coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>. Examining the concept of choice helps characterize principles for making "good choices or wise choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>.

### Interaction vs. Relation
*   **Relation:** Atemporal, as seen in mathematics which studies structures of relationships without needing a temporal element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>.
*   **Interaction:** Inherently temporal, involving a "before" and "after" (e.g., in an experiment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. Interaction implies the flow of information, temporality, and other possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. The concept of an observer is implied within the notion of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:00">[34:46:00]</a>. Landry asserts that interaction is more fundamental than the notion of [[existence_and_the_nature_of_reality | existence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>.

## Addressing Cartesian Dualism

Cartesian dualism concerns the relationship between mind and matter, or substance in the world versus beings in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:40:00">[58:40:00]</a>. Historically, this involves realism (substance is primary) and idealism (consciousness is primary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

Landry contrasts his work with both positions by focusing on the relationship between realism and idealism, or mind and body, as the primary subject of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. He does not posit objective [[existence_and_the_nature_of_reality | existence]] or subjective [[existence_and_the_nature_of_reality | existence]] as unconditional. Instead, he describes the relationship between the subjective and the objective as unconditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.

Inspired by Descartes' "I think, therefore I am," Landry emphasizes that the *process* of thinking is the basis for establishing being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This means ontology is contingent upon epistemology (knowing or thinking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### The Root Tautology and Process
Landry introduces the "root tautology," stating that "comparison is a process, measurement is a process, signaling is a process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Concepts like choice, change, and causation are manifestations of this underlying notion of process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. By characterizing the nature of process itself, Landry learns about the intrinsics of doubt and the relationship between subjective and objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>. The relationship between realism and idealism is itself more primal than either realism or idealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.

## Mind from Brain and Consciousness

In the context of mind and brain, Landry acknowledges that neuroscience identifies neural correlates of subjective experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. However, he argues that even perfected knowledge of these correlations would not answer the "hard problem" of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>. This problem concerns *why* a particular moment is "this one," as correlations don't explain causation or distinguish between past, present, and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.

Landry posits that the concept of consciousness is bound to the concepts of time and "hard random" (potentiality or probability over possibility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>. The existence of the subjective is directly connected to temporality and the notion of process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>. While physicalist models describe phenomena, they don't provide tools to explain the transition from a third-person (objective) perspective to a first-person (subjective) perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. The "symmetry breaking" that localizes consciousness to a specific place, moment, and possibility remains an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a>.

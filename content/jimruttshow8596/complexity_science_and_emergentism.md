[[Emergentism and complexity science | Complexity science and emergentism]] form a core metaphysical framework, particularly as articulated by Alexander Bard, which seeks to move beyond traditional philosophical [[reductionism and complexity science | reductionism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.

## Transcendental Emergentism

Bard's metaphysics, developed with Alexander Ving and Jan SÃ¶ndquist, is called [[Emergentism and complexity science | transcendental emergentism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. This approach resists the trap of [[reductionism and complexity science | reductionism]], which often seeks a single explanation for everything, whether at the level of a fundamental atom (atomism) or consciousness (panpsychism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. Instead, it posits that the world "happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>, and philosophy should focus on defining these "happenings," or [[emergent_complexity_and_consciousness | eventology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.

### Core Principles

*   **Focus on Happenings**: [[Emergence and complexity in life | Emergence]] is described as the "birth of something novel that never happened before in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.
*   **Emergence Vectors**: The world consists of "[[emergence and complexity science | emergence vectors]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>, which are domains where novel phenomena arise and operate on their own terms. Examples include:
    *   Sub-physics and physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>
    *   Chemistry and [[complexity and emergence in biological systems | biology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>
    *   Mind, consciousness, and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>
*   **Accidental Monism**: The universe is accidentally monist, meaning "everything is connected with everything else," and new [[emergence and complexity in life | emergence vectors]] can arise within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **No Creator God**: This framework aims to completely remove the concept of a Creator God or prime mover, as it leads to "boringly stupid" philosophical dead ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.
*   **Local Teleology**: While there is no global teleology or ultimate purpose for the universe as a whole, [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | local teleology]] is allowed and even encouraged within constrained systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This allows for the creation of events and human innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

## Uniqueness and Evolution

[[Emergentism and complexity science | Emergentism]] highlights the constant creation of unique "occasions" in existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. This aligns with a Darwinian view where evolution doesn't have a teleological direction but produces constant change and novelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:29">[02:25:29]</a>. The uniqueness of phenomena like life on Earth, even if based on similar underlying chemistry, is emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.

## Complexity in Social Systems

[[Complexity science and societal systems | Complexity science]] is applied to understanding human societies:

*   **The Socium and Tribopoesis**: The concept of the "socium" (clan or tribe, typically 150-1500 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> is a fundamental unit of human organization.
    *   The term "tribopoesis" is introduced as a refinement of "autopoiesis" (self-organization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:55">[01:27:55]</a>.
    *   "Autopoiesis" is seen as a sloppy term, almost magical, as it implies a "self" organizing itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:27">[01:29:27]</a>.
    *   "Tribopoesis" emphasizes that organization in human social collectives (tribes) comes from the interaction of individuals with various drives and desires, embodying archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>.
    *   It is suggested that "autopoiesis" might only apply at a universal, global level, while "tribopoesis" is more appropriate for local systems like flocks of birds or human communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>.
    *   Tribopoesis can serve as a first principle for ethics and values within communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>.
*   **Membranes and Coherent Pluralism**: Social systems operate with "membranes," which are intelligent, semi-permeable boundaries that regulate what comes in and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>.
    *   Membranes allow for the existence of diverse "flavors" or "sauces" within different social units, leading to [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | coherent pluralism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:31">[01:43:31]</a>.
    *   This allows for various forms of social organization and beliefs, as long as they don't impose on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:08">[01:44:08]</a>.
    *   The "code inside the membrane" can dynamically adapt, changing its permeability based on learned experiences (e.g., banning smartphones for children after observing their negative impact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:56">[01:41:56]</a>. This dynamic adaptation is a "dialectical process" that requires memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:03">[01:42:03]</a>.

## Addressing Tyranny

The philosophical mission includes the fight against tyranny, which is seen as a "failed human being" and a "boy pharaoh" mentality lacking a sense of humor and driven by revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:01">[01:54:01]</a>. This also extends to "pillar saints" who are ideological "big men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>. Decentralization, open-source technology, and individual control over algorithms are crucial tools to avoid the surveillance police state and combat these forms of tyranny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:02">[01:50:02]</a>.

The Consilience Project aims to support a [[social_and_cultural_change | new cultural renaissance]] or enlightenment, where people understand the unique challenges the world faces and develop capacities for sense-making, effective communication, and participation in new problem-solving and governance systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This initiative is designed to foster a bottom-up emergence of new institutions, rather than having them imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## The Unique Problems of the Modern World

The world currently faces unique problems due to exponential technology and digital globalization that it never encountered previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

Key challenges include:
*   **Scale and Complexity**: The asymmetry between large enterprises (like Amazon) and individuals is vastly different from historical periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Quantitative differences can become qualitative changes, meaning old frameworks may no longer apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Change**: The pace of change is far more rapid than in previous centuries, with some domains feeling like they are "going straight up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.
*   **Existential Risks**: The nuclear bomb introduced the ability to destroy the habitability of the planet, making human self-induced [[civilizational_collapse_and_sustainability | existential risk]] a real thing for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. Traditional approaches like warfare between empires are no longer viable due to concepts like mutually assured destruction (MAD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.
*   **Planetary Boundaries**: Exponential growth driven by globalization has led to hitting planetary boundaries, an issue that never existed before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Humanity now accounts for the vast majority of large mammal and bird mass on Earth, indicating a significant impact on ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:08]</a>.

## Erosion of Core Institutions

For an open society, democracy, or republic to function, higher levels of education and press quality are uniquely required compared to closed societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. The American founding fathers, like Jefferson and Washington, recognized the fundamental importance of an educated citizenry and an honest press for self-governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>.

However, both the educational system and the fourth estate (press) in the U.S. and the West have [[institutional_failure_and_critique | eroded]] over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Media Landscape**: The fragmented media landscape, driven by ad models, incentivizes appealing to bias, tribalism, and salacious headlines, leading to a "pathological fourth estate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>. Social media platforms, optimized for time on site, push content that confirms existing biases, fosters fear of out-groups, and elicits outrage, leading to increased polarization and extremism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>. This has created a situation where people's responses can be more predictable than GPT-3 algorithms, resembling "memetic propagation" rather than original thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>.
*   **Political Polarization**: Political parties have become a matter of "life or death" in identity, with a higher disapproval rate for children marrying someone from an opposing political party than based on race or religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:31:00">[59:31:00]</a>. This deep enmity and infighting within a nation, where citizens treat each other as enemies, is a symptom of a dying system undergoing [[institutional_failure_and_critique | institutional decay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:02:00">[53:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:37:00">[56:37:00]</a>.

## The Need for New Problem-Solving Processes

Current problem-solving processes often fail to address catastrophic risks, or they create additional, cumulatively worse problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. Solutions designed narrowly (e.g., for one nation, or one metric like CO2) can externalize harm elsewhere, leading to resistance and infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.

*   **Beyond Game Theory**: Humanity needs to move beyond "rivalrous dynamics multiplied by exponential tech," which is a generator of [[civilizational_collapse_and_sustainability | existential risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>. This necessitates a basis for choice-making other than just game theory, which is why "Game B" is a relevant concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>. Cooperation is essential, especially as warfare with exponential technology can lead to "exponential direct destruction or exponential indirect destruction through externality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.
*   **Defining Problems Broadly**: A key aspect is understanding the interconnectedness of problems and the underlying systemic incentives that give rise to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>. The goal is to define the problem space clearly enough to generate design criteria for new social systems and problem-solving approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

## A New Cultural Renaissance

The Consilience Project aims to catalyze a [[social_and_cultural_change | new cultural renaissance]] to develop the capacities needed to make sense of the world, communicate effectively, and participate in new systems of problem-solving and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This involves:

*   **Epistemic Commons**: The concept of an "epistemic commons" refers to the shared process of belief formation about what is true and understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>. A democracy cannot function if its citizens cannot make sense of the issues government is addressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:16:00">[30:16:00]</a>.
*   **Three Epistemologies**: A necessary cultural enlightenment must include first-person, second-person, and third-person epistemologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>.
    *   **First-person**: Understanding one's own cognitive biases, desires for certainty, and unwillingness to admit error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>. This requires courage and comfort with uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
    *   **Second-person**: The ability to understand and inhabit others' perspectives, as in the Socratic method or Hegelian dialectic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.
    *   **Third-person**: The philosophy of science, which deals with repeatable, measurable phenomena to understand the objective world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.
*   **Transcending Tribalism**: To avoid [[evolutionary_and_cultural_dynamics | cultural arms races]] driven by exponential tech, people must overcome tribalism and develop a "memetic immune system" against narrative warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:29">[01:07:29]</a>. This means acknowledging that others do not cease to exist or act politically just because they are "out-grouped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.
*   **Moral Education and Civic Virtue**: Beyond cognitive sense-making, a moral education is needed to inform choices in service to shared values and foster civic virtue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. This forms the basis for coordinated choice-making and cooperation necessary for [[civilizational_design_and_transformation | civilization's design and transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>.

## The Consilience Project's Approach

The Consilience Project (consilienceproject.org) is a non-profit initiative with two major branches:
1.  **Publishing Branch**: Publishes three types of articles:
    *   **Foundation Series**: Theoretical pieces exploring the uniqueness of the problem landscape and reifying social theories to understand their strengths and inadequacies for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>. An example is "Democracy in the Epistemic Commons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Situational Assessments**: Apply social theory to current global issues (e.g., U.S.-China relations, movement from traditional finance to crypto, exponential tech risks) using a "consilience epistemics" approach that factors in various narrative views and epistemologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>. An example is an article on China's activity in East Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49:00">[33:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Meta News**: Addresses highly polarized topics by forensically analyzing how different narratives arose, identifying vested interests, epistemic biases, and how platforms optimize for tribalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>. This aims to help people develop a "memetic immune system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a>. An example meta news piece analyzed the "bricks planted at protests" narrative during the George Floyd protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Movement Catalyzing Branch**: Seeks to identify and support groups doing critical work related to the epistemic commons, sense-making, and choice-making capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>.

The project operates under specific principles:
*   **Open Access**: Information is not behind a paywall, nor does it sell user data or display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. It is donation-funded, accepting no donations with strings attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>.
*   **Collective Intelligence**: Articles do not have individual author bylines to encourage focus on content, decrease *ad hominem* attacks, and reduce internal perverse incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>.
*   **Catalytic Role**: The project aims to be an example to other media organizations by publishing its methods (e.g., for meta news), hoping others will innovate and adopt them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>. It seeks to change the nature of demand for information by showing what high-quality, nuanced reporting looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>.
*   **Self-Terminating**: The project is designed to self-terminate after five years to avoid the common organizational incentive to perpetuate existence rather than solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>. This signals that it's not in competition with other groups but aims to help them do better work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>.

### Target Audience

Initially, the content targets generally educated adults who are willing to engage deeply with complex, nuanced topics that may challenge their existing biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>. The project acknowledges this is a smaller audience but plans to translate its deep work into more accessible forms, like animations and podcasts, to reach wider audiences over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. The ultimate goal is for the insights to be disseminated and amplified by others in a decentralized manner, fostering a broad [[social_and_cultural_change | cultural renaissance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>.

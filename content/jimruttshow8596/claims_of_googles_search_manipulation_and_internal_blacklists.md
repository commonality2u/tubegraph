Zachary Vorhies, a former Google software engineer, has made [[zachary_vorhies_experience_and_allegations_as_a_google_whistleblower | provocative claims]] alleging that Google has acted improperly and illegally regarding search results and internal blacklists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He claims Google has been [[instances_of_alleged_interference_by_google_in_political_and_electoral_matters | meddling in search results]], YouTube queries, and elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. To support his assertions, Vorhies publicly posted a large repository of what he describes as Google's internal documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Google's Reaction to the Disclosure

Upon discovering Vorhies was the leaker, Google reportedly attempted to stop him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. They initiated a "wellness check" on him, which Vorhies describes as a police visit prompted by a tip suggesting a person might be unwell or plan to do something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He views this as an Orwellian tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Google allegedly used Vorhies's "Deadman switch" post on Twitter—a warning that information would be disclosed if he were harmed—as justification for the wellness check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Vorhies believes Google's management prioritizes loyalty over competence, contributing to a "rot" within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Post-2016 Election Changes and "Fake News"

According to Vorhies, a significant shift occurred at Google after the 2016 US presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. He observed Google executives expressing distress, attributing Donald Trump's election to Russian hacking, racism, hate, and misogyny in the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Following this, odd internal papers began to appear on Google's networks around December 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

One such paper, titled "psychological induced stress as a result of algorithmic discrimination," discussed how to reduce user stress by providing "non-functional buttons and dials that would pretend to turn some of the censorship off," to restore a user's sense of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Another part of the paper described how to simulate crowding to increase ad engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Vorhies states that Google then started defining "fake news" as a reason for Trump's election, leading them to "protect the American public" by cracking down on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. He claims that internal documents listed factual events, such as Hillary Clinton allegedly running weapons to fund ISIS, as examples of "fake news" to be censored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Vorhies alleges Google started to "sculpt the information landscape" by filtering information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### The [[issues_surrounding_googles_machine_learning_fairness_project | Machine Learning Fairness Project]]

Vorhies details a system called "[[issues_surrounding_googles_machine_learning_fairness_project | machine learning fairness]]" (ML Fairness), which he describes as an "Orwellian term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This project's purpose is to revise and bias Google search results, YouTube results, and news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. According to Vorhies, it takes training data to generate rules that rank content based on how "fair" it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

One document, he says, defined algorithmic unfairness by example:
> "imagine that you were doing a search for CEOs and most of the results that pop back were male and Google's words were if even if this represented objective reality we could still classify it as algorithmically unfair and that we should intervene via product intervention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>

Vorhies interprets this as an attempt by Google to "change the nature of reality to make a better person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. He also asserts that internal documents suggest Google views users as "programmed based upon the content that they're interacting with," and that Google intends to use its control mechanisms to "program" users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Allegations of Political Bias and Election Interference

Vorhies claims that Google's actions show a clear political bias and [[instances_of_alleged_interference_by_google_in_political_and_electoral_matters | election meddling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. He argues that Google's claims of objectivity and not "putting a thumb on the scale" are false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Perjury to Congress

Vorhies alleges that Google executives, including CEO Sundar Pichai, have committed perjury before Congress by denying the use of blacklists or having a political ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. He claims to have disclosed two blacklists, and states that Robert Epstein has discovered nine others, totaling around a dozen public blacklists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

He provides an example of alleged search manipulation:
*   Typing "Trump body-count" into Google's search engine will auto-predict the full phrase, despite low search volume for it on `trends.google.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.
*   Typing "Hillary body" will not auto-predict "Hillary body count," even though `trends.google.com` shows significant search volume for that term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

Vorhies states that this pattern of discrepancies, always aligning with a specific political orientation, indicates intentional manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. He encourages listeners to use `trends.google.com` to cross-reference Google's autocomplete suggestions and verify the alleged bias themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.

### International Election Interference

Vorhies claims Google has interfered in elections beyond the US:
*   **Ireland**: By banning the phrase "eighth amendment to the constitution of Ireland" which was disclosed in a YouTube query blacklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>.
*   **Brazil**: Brazil's Supreme Court reportedly ruled that Google interfered in their election, presenting a contract between Google and an opponent to the current president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

## Internal Power Structure and Control

Vorhies discusses Google's unique stock structure, which includes Class B shares with preferential voting rights (10 votes per share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. This means insiders, who hold these shares, "absolutely control the company," effectively disempowering other shareholders and insulating executives from fiduciary responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This structure, he claims, allows Google to abandon its fiduciary responsibilities and engage in what he calls "criminal activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

## Targeted Account Deactivations

Vorhies describes a "security vulnerability" that a group of Google insiders allegedly exploit to deactivate accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. He illustrates this with the case of Jordan B. Peterson's email account, which was allegedly deactivated when accounts with similar addresses spammed other emails, causing Google's AI to deactivate the original account as part of the "spam network" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

He believes this same pattern was used to suspend Tulsi Gabbard's ad account during the Democratic debates, which resulted in her opponents' promoted websites appearing first when people searched for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>. Vorhies provided an open letter to Gabbard's attorney detailing how to use Google's bug database to investigate this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

## The "Kafea" Incident: Vorhies's Breaking Point

Vorhies states his personal "breaking point" that compelled him to become a whistleblower was witnessing Google allegedly delete translation words from the Arabic-to-English dictionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. This was done, he claims, to make a Donald Trump tweet sound "crazy," which was then used by *The New York Times* to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.

The specific word was "Kafea" (F/A), which in Arabic means "we will stand up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. Vorhies states that a Google executive created a document to replace the translation with an "easter egg," but instead the word was simply deleted from the dictionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. He also claims Google had to delete it twice because their AI was smart enough to transliterate and find an alternative path to the word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. Vorhies views this as "treasonous behavior" and a national security issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:46">[00:45:46]</a>.

## Call to Action for Future Whistleblowers

Vorhies advises other Google employees with evidence of misdeeds not to communicate directly with him, as he believes he is being watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. Instead, he recommends contacting Project Veritas, citing their professionalism, integrity, and ability to protect whistleblowers' identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. He specifically suggests using a VPN and the Tor browser when submitting information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.

> [!INFO] Guest's Disclaimer
> The interviewer, Jim Rut, states that he had not researched Zach Vorhies nor reviewed his documents extensively, and did not hold a strong opinion on his claims at the time of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Rut notes that Vorhies's claims are "very disturbing if true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He encourages listeners to "decide for yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> and to access Vorhies's publicly available documents at `ProjectVeritas.com/Google-Dump` to verify the claims directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

Vorhies's article providing evidence for some of his claims can be found at `medium.com` with the title "Why did Google suppress autocomplete for Clinton body count?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

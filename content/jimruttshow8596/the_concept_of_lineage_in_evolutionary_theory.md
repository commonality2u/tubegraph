In [[Evolutionary biology and its application to modern challenges | evolutionary theory]], the concept of "lineage" provides a lens for examining evolution that goes beyond traditional short-term metrics of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>. This idea, largely developed by Bret Weinstein, addresses limitations in how [[Evolutionary biology and its application to modern challenges | evolutionary science]] often measures fitness and reproductive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.

## Beyond Short-Term Fitness

Traditional measures of fitness and reproductive success in [[Evolutionary biology and its application to modern challenges | evolutionary science]] typically focus on immediate outcomes, such as the number of offspring in the first or subsequent generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. While these metrics can be effective if the future environment closely resembles the past, they inherently assume that short-term outcomes will persist into the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. This approach overlooks the potential impact of rare, significant events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>.

## Lineage as a Long-Term Perspective

Thinking in terms of lineage enables a longer-term analysis of [[Evolutionary biology and its application to modern challenges | evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>. It acknowledges that individuals making decisions that keep them out of harm's way, whether through wits or chance, can ensure the survival of their lineage over extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>. For example, if a volcanic eruption, wildfire, or flood occurs, those who had many offspring a hundred years prior become irrelevant if their descendants do not survive the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

This perspective is crucial for understanding [[Complexity theory and evolution of life | "fat tail events"]], which are big deviations that occur more often than expected in complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>. While such events are rare by definition, considering them is essential for a lineage to survive indefinitely into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>. The lineage framework allows for a "rich" consideration of [[Evolutionary biology and its application to modern challenges | evolution]] within the context of these unpredictable, high-impact occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.

## The Omega Principle and Genetic Interests

The [[The relationship between genetic evolution and cultural adaptation | Omega Principle]] posits a necessary relationship between genes and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>. Culture, as an epigenetic regulator, is more flexible and adapts faster than genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>. However, it ultimately serves the genetic interests of the lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>. Any cultural practice that has persisted and is complex is considered [[Evolutionary biology and its application to modern challenges | evolutionary]] and, at its core, serves these genetic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

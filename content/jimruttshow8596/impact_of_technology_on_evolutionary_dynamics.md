The integration of human-created [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | technology]] into global systems has fundamentally altered [[evolutionary_and_cultural_dynamics | evolutionary dynamics]], leading to unprecedented challenges for civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. While past [[evolutionary_and_cultural_dynamics | civilizations]] underwent internal decay and collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, the current globalized civilization faces issues of a different magnitude due to [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | technology]] and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Evolution vs. Technology

Natural evolution and human-created [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | technology]] operate under fundamentally different dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Misapplying [[evolutionary_and_cultural_dynamics | evolutionary theory]] to human systems, such as markets, can lead to incorrect assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Characteristics of Evolved Systems
Evolved systems are characterized by three primary features:
*   **Mutation**: Occurs relatively evenly across an ecosystem (e.g., gamma rays, oxidation, copying errors affecting all species similarly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Selection**: Involves both survival and reproduction (mate selection) within [[evolutionary_and_cultural_dynamics | evolutionary niches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Co-selective Pressures**: Advances in one species (e.g., a faster lion) lead to similar advancements in others (e.g., faster gazelles), resulting in a strong, symmetric coupling of power across the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This creates a "meta-stability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Nature**: Unconscious, radically parallel, distributed, combinatoric, slow, and typically results in self-stabilizing complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Characteristics of Human-Created Technology
[[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | Technology]], defined as consciously mediated methods of doing things that come from the capacity for abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, differs significantly:
*   **Abstract Pattern Replicators**: [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | Technology]] (e.g., language, social tech, physical tools) can change much faster than physically instantiated genetic replicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Uneven Distribution**: Technological change can occur locally, not necessarily everywhere simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Intentional Creation**: Driven by agents understanding abstract principles and intentionally creating solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Impact on Systems**: Creates parts not necessarily in equilibrium with whole systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Fragility**: Human-made systems tend to be fragile, unlike the antifragility of natural systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.

## Consequences of Technological Impact

### Breaking Power Symmetry
[[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | Technology]] has broken the power symmetry essential for the meta-stability of evolved systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   Humans, as apex predators operating with [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | tools]], can increase their predatory capacity orders of magnitude faster than the environment can build resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Unlike animals that fit a niche and don't leave it, humans, with their tools, can move to new environments after over-exploiting one, becoming apex predators everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   The destructive capacity of human-made [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | technology]] (e.g., ocean trawlers) is incomparable to natural predators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   Humans, or their domesticated animals, now constitute the majority of biomass for large mammals and birds on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Rebound Effects and Limits of Growth
Increases in efficiency due to [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | technology]] do not lead to greater sustainability; instead, they enable further exploitation of new markets and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This is seen in Jevons paradox, where energy efficiency leads to increased net energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Humanity continuously finds ways to exploit new niches without waiting for genetic mutation, driving exponential growth in resource consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

### Rival Risk Games and Exponential Technology
The combination of human [[economic_and_social_dynamics_in_technology_adoption | rival risk games]] and [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | exponential technology]] creates a fundamentally unstable system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Rival Risk Games**: An in-group seeks to get ahead, potentially at the expense of an out-group or the Commons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Exponential Amplification**: [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | Asymmetric technology]] provides radical amplification of agency to single actors or small groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This means a lion cannot increase its killing ability thousands of times over, but a human with a weapon can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Self-Termination**: Running [[economic_and_social_dynamics_in_technology_adoption | rival risk games]] with exponentially increasing capacity for harm on a finite playing field inevitably leads to self-termination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **Inability to Stop Exponential Tech**: Since [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | exponential technology]] cannot be "put back in the bag," humanity must develop rigorously anti-rivalry systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

### Generative Functions of Existential Risk
Many catastrophic and existential risks stem from common "generator functions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>:
1.  **Rival Risk Games Multiplied by Exponential Tech**: As discussed, this leads to an inability to prevent harm when strong incentives exist to cause it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
2.  **Complicated Systems Subsuming Complex Substrates**: Humans build complicated, fragile systems (e.g., a house from a tree) that increasingly replace complex, antifragile natural systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. This increases the fragility-to-antifragility ratio, through which more energy is run, leading to breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.
3.  **Solutions Creating Worse Problems**: Human problem-solving, often narrowly defined, creates larger, unintended externalities (e.g., the plow solving local famines but causing desertification, the internal combustion engine solving horse manure but causing climate change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>. The information processing required for safety analysis (NP-hard) is orders of magnitude greater than for creating new [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | technology]] (polynomial) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>.

### Information Ecology and Sociopathy
The pursuit of competitive advantage leads to the withholding of true information (trade secrets, classified info) and the active spread of disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.
*   [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | Exponential information technology]] allows for customized disinformation, making it difficult to distinguish signal from noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
*   This creates "fractal defection," where individuals optimize for personal gain or small group loyalty at the expense of the whole, leading to a catastrophic breakdown in sense-making necessary for good choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   Sociopathy, present in varying percentages in the population (e.g., 3-5% general, up to 30% in C-suite), is attracted to and incentivized by power structures like corporations and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. These top-down power systems act as "strange attractors" for those who want power over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.
*   In contrast, small, transparent social groups (like tribes) make sociopathy disadvantageous due to enforced transparency and close relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

## Towards a New Civilization System (Game B)

To overcome these challenges, a new civilizational model is required, radically different from any before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Anti-Rival Risk Systems
The core problem is the inability to coordinate between agents whose basis for agency intrinsically creates deltas between personal good and collective good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>.
*   This necessitates moving from [[economic_and_social_dynamics_in_technology_adoption | rival risk]] to non-rival risk, and ultimately to **anti-rival risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>.
*   In an anti-rival risk system, individual well-being and collective well-being are rigorously positively coupled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.

### Redefining Ownership and Value
*   The concept of private property creates incentives for hoarding, artificial scarcity, and exploiting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
*   A shift to **Commonwealth access-based dynamics** (e.g., the sharing economy mediated by [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | blockchain]] for common resource management) could drastically reduce resource load and remove destructive competitive dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.
*   In such a system, identity and self-actualization would derive not from "getting stuff," but from **creating and contributing** to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>. Creativity is high-dimensional and non-fungible, making it harder to compare in a zero-sum way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

### Transitioning to a New Paradigm
The challenge lies in transitioning from the current "Game A" to a new "Game B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.
*   A clear, architecturally sound blueprint for Game B is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>.
*   The current system, despite appearances, is not truly economically optimized for overall human well-being or the production of universally beneficial [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:39">[01:08:39]</a>.
*   A "social [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | technology]]" that is anti-rival risk (i.e., solvent for weaponization itself) could provide an increased capacity that cannot be weaponized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.
*   This social [[the_nature_and_evolution_of_technology | technology]] would incentivize full earnestness and transparency, leading to an intact information ecology and radically better sense-making and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>.
*   Such a system, fundamentally more attractive and open-sourced, could become a "new strange attractor" or "attractor basin," drawing in early adopters and eventually mainstream society due to its superior quality of life and problem-solving capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.

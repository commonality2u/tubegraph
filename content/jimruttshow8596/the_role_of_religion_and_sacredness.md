The podcast introduces Brendan Graham Dempsey, author of "A Universal Learning Process: The Evolution of Meaning (Book One)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This new work is a departure from his previous book, "Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, which mentioned "religion" 124 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. In contrast, "A Universal Learning Process" only mentions the word "religion" twice in passing, with the first instance not appearing until page 73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Dempsey clarifies that the "Emergentism" book was intended for a popular audience and offered a broad take on similar ideas without extensive academic referencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. His new work, however, is in a different register, aiming to thoroughly assemble scientific and academic literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Religion's Place in the Evolution of Meaning

While the current book doesn't focus on it, Dempsey affirms that future volumes of "The Evolution of Meaning" series will delve into questions of [[the_role_of_religion_in_meaning_and_society | religion]], as it is an essential part of assessing [[distinctions_between_meaning_mystery_and_sacredness | human meaning-making]] throughout the cultural record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. He intends to descriptively discuss [[the_role_of_religion_in_societal_stability | religious evolution]] and later engage with it philosophically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. [[the_role_of_religion_in_societal_stability | Religion]] has been a significant force in human cultural evolution for as long as historical records exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

At the human cultural level, individuals engage in [[role_of_mythos_and_beliefs_in_society | religious justification systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. The series will also touch upon traditional [[philosophical_concepts_of_sacredness_and_spirituality | philosophical]], existential, and [[the_role_of_spirituality_and_the_concept_of_God | wisdom-oriented]] information processing related to [[the_role_of_spirituality_and_the_concept_of_God | spirituality]] and [[the_role_of_spirituality_and_the_concept_of_God | theological]] concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:35">[01:26:35]</a>.

## The Concept of the Sacred

Dempsey elaborates on the concept of the [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]], particularly at the human level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>:

*   **Repositories of Understanding** The [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] refers to repositories of tried-and-true, established, and successful forms of understanding the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:44">[01:43:44]</a>. These are the deep informing aspects of collective ways of being that have historically fostered flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.
*   **Cultural Function** These collective representations and modes of being (which can include beliefs, rituals, or other enshrined practices) are given special reverence, appreciation, and protection because they have proven successful in sustaining the collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:15">[01:44:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>.
*   **World-Building** The [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] contributes to "world-building" and the construction of "Sacred Space," which are world-sustaining concepts that cohere groups through time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a>.
*   **Functional Similarity** Different societies may deem very different things [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] (e.g., a sacred pole in a forager society vs. the "sacred institutions of democracy" in a modern state), but their function in societal cohesion and flourishing is deeply similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>. Without these [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] elements, societies risk entropic breakdown and a collapse of their complex structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:37">[01:46:37]</a>.
*   **Thermodynamic Theory of the Sacred** Dempsey proposes a "thermodynamic theory of the Sacred," suggesting that the [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] itself can be seen as a complexifying structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>. It uses human collective social configurations as a substrate, expressing itself through linguistic justification systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:46">[01:47:46]</a>. This requires energy to maintain, and as social organizations complexify, they demand more energy, which the [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] helps to buttress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>. Thus, the [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] acts as a dissipative structure that is complexifying over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:15">[01:48:15]</a>.

### The Evolution of the Sacred

The podcast delves into the idea that the [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:20">[01:51:20]</a>:

*   **Past vs. Present** Historically, various practices and concepts (e.g., slavery, patriarchy, [[influence_of_religion_on_politics | dominance through violence]]) were held as [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:52">[01:49:52]</a>. While these might have been adaptive in their specific contexts, they are no longer considered so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:44">[01:49:44]</a>. The shift in what is considered [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] has accelerated in recent centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:17">[01:50:17]</a>.
*   **Balancing Stability and Change** There's a tension between preserving the [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] for stability and modifying it to remain adaptive in changing environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>. Changing too rapidly risks societal collapse, while failing to change at all leads to non-adaptiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:30">[01:50:30]</a>.
*   **Contemporary Challenges** Current societal turbulence, including the "meaning crisis," stems from a breakdown of collective meaning and value structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>. There is a sense of instability and chaos as societies grapple with finding new cohesive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:03">[01:54:03]</a>.
*   **Towards a More Complex Sacred** Dempsey argues against a false dichotomy between traditional [[the_role_of_religion_in_meaning_and_society | religion]] and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:41">[01:54:41]</a>. He believes that science has its own notions of the [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] and that a more complex, adaptable notion of the [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] is needed to meet the challenges of a rapidly complexifying world driven by untapped energy resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:06">[01:55:06]</a>. The goal is to articulate a notion of the [[symbols_and_sacredness_in_human_cognition_and_society | sacred]] that is real and valuable without falling into old, absolutist, or essentialist positions that are not complex enough for the current moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:32">[01:55:32]</a>.

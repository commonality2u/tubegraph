Tui Saliba, co-founder and CEO of Hypercycle, and Global Chair for Internet Protocols for [[AI risk categorization and management | AI Security]] at IEEE, discusses the development of decentralized networks for [[AI and human coexistence | AI Communications]] and the TOA IP protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Introducing TOA IP and Hypercycle
TOA IP is a network communication protocol initially developed by technologists aiming to eliminate dependency on third parties in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The name "TOA" was a placeholder, combining the names of co-creators Tui and Dan, and serendipitously meaning "thank you" in Hebrew, while also referencing physicist Moratu Toda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Hypercycle focuses on providing a secure plug into the internet for AI, similar to what Cisco did for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

## Core Problem: The Need for Trustless, Sub-second Value Exchange
Traditional human-dependent communication and transaction systems, like banks or ledger-based blockchains, introduce delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This is problematic for [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AI]] agents, which require sub-second communication for value exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. If an [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AI]] doesn't receive a response within 100 milliseconds, it moves on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

Traditional systems also incur significant costs. For instance, a transaction fee might exceed the value of a micro-transaction (e.g., 0.01 cent for a translation), making it economically unfeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## TOA IP Solution: Peer-to-Peer Value Communication
TOA IP enables communication of "value" between devices without relying on a third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This allows for sub-second transactions by eliminating the friction of time and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### How it Works:
*   **Instantaneous Verification**: Within the first network packet handshake, all necessary cryptographic proofs are exchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This allows the receiver to instantly verify ownership and prevent double-spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Data Structure**: TOA IP uses a definitive and precise data structure, making it impossible for a faker to use an already utilized data structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The uniqueness is ensured by time and space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Minimal Cost**: 99% of the cost is attributed to the compute run on each side during the transaction, allowing for extremely low-value transactions (e.g., 0.00001 cent) to be economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Global Hash**: When a transaction is made and work is proven, the participating device contributes to forming a global hash that propagates across the network every 10-15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This ensures that the recipient has cryptographic proof of ownership that is verifiable anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Value Transfer and Settlement in Hypercycle
The system uses a "hypc" container, which acts as a carrier for various currencies like US Dollars (predominantly USDC) or Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

*   **Onboarding/Offboarding**: Ledger-based blockchains are used solely for onboarding and offboarding value into/out of the Hypercycle network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **chpc Smart Contract**: A decentralized smart contract called "chpc" acts as a bridge for this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. It ensures accountability for funds entering and leaving the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. This bridging costs about $1-$2 per transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
*   **NFT-like Value**: A "TOA file" or "hypc" has a unique global number, functioning as a true non-fungible token (NFT) to ensure no two devices can use the same file at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. Bitcoin's individual Satoshis are also considered non-fungible tokens, making Bitcoin an easier currency to integrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **"Deployed" Funds**: Once US dollars (or other currencies) are put into the hypc container, they are "deployed" into the AI network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. While AI agents can use these fractions of pennies for micro-transactions within the network at virtually no cost, cashing out to the "homo sapien" world still incurs traditional blockchain fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.

The analogy of paper money backed by gold is suggested, where TOA containers are like paper notes for underlying assets, rarely cashed out unless needed for external human systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

## TOA IP as a Ledger-less Blockchain
Tui Saliba describes TOA IP as a "ledger-less blockchain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Unlike typical blockchains that rely on a shared ledger, TOA IP processes events in blocks of time, allowing devices to cryptographically prove their interactions and move to the next block without a global ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

While Hypercycle avoids building on existing blockchains, it utilizes them for specific purposes like software license sales, which are faster (15 seconds) than traditional accounts payable/receivable processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

## Strategic Focus on AI Services
Hypercycle intentionally restricts its system from handling simple, rudimentary computes that humans or non-sophisticated machines could easily fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Instead, it focuses on complex [[Evaluating AI Understanding and Capability | AI compute]] services that require significant computation, ensuring the value exchanged is tied to real, verifiable work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.

This strategic choice was made to avoid conflict with existing financial systems and ledger-based blockchains, turning potential enemies into partners. By creating a new territory for AI, Hypercycle avoids disrupting established industries and focuses on providing value where no one else is operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.

The market fostered is for *results* or *services* (e.g., high-fidelity language translation), not just raw compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. The value creation is tied to the intellectual property and demand for a node's specific service, allowing the node owner to retain the appreciating value of their [[AI as a selfleveraging accelerator posing existential risks | AI]] intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

## Facilitating Decentralized [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AGI]]
Hypercycle aims to empower anyone running [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AI]] to make more money and become smarter, which directly contributes to the development of [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AGI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. The belief is that [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AGI]] will be achieved through a multi-agent system rather than a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.

The definition of [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AGI]] provided is a machine that can evolve itself, only needing time and resources, without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. This point is considered rapidly approaching, potentially even sooner than Ray Kurzweil's 2029 prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

A key advantage of [[decentralized governance and its impact on AI development | decentralized governance]] for [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AGI]] is that the entire world will reach [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AGI]] first, as opposed to a single, centralized entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. This provides a more secure and ethically diverse path for [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AGI]], as no single group can dictate its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>. The inherent disagreement among humans on "ethics" becomes a strength, preventing monolithic, potentially dangerous, control over a superintelligent [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AGI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>.

By incentivizing all [[AI]] developers and even large companies like Microsoft to use Hypercycle's decentralized [[AI Communications]] network, the system aims to integrate them as partners rather than treating them as enemies, accelerating the decentralized [[Artificial general intelligence AGI risks | AGI]] timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.

## Getting Involved with Hypercycle
Individuals can get involved with Hypercycle through capital or knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.
*   **Capital**: A single node costs about $160, while a "node factory" (which can create 1,024 nodes over time) costs around $1,000, combining a node with a hypc container (an "[[AI and human coexistence | AI marriage]]") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.
*   **Knowledge**: There is high demand for people who can run nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Developers can learn to operate nodes and participate in "wealth creation" by following resources like hackathon steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.
*   **Development Languages**: Hypercycle's virtual machines primarily use Python, with support for EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.

## Relationship with SingularityNet
Hypercycle and SingularityNet are complementary, not competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>.
*   **Hypercycle**: Focuses on the underlying security network that allows any [[AI]] agent to talk to any other [[AI]] agent securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. It provides a secure communication layer (analogous to HTTP/TCP) that allows different [[AI]] clusters (e.g., from SingularityNet, Microsoft, Google) to interoperate and compensate each other securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>.
*   **SingularityNet**: Focuses on the actual [[AI]] nodes and operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. It's like the "smart guys" or directories within different companies that want to communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.

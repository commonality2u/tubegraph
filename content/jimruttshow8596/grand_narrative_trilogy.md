The "Grand Narrative Trilogy" is a series of three books co-authored by Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist [0:04:25]. This collection aims to explore the kinds of stories humans tell about themselves [0:04:28].

## Purpose and Concepts

The authors believe that the study of these narratives merits its own philosophical discipline, which they call [[protopian_narratology | Narratology]] [0:04:33]. [[protopian_narratology | Narratology]] is described as the "logos of narratives," investigating the types of stories humans tell about each other and themselves, understanding why they differ, and emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between them due to their varied purposes [0:04:42].

A core idea within the trilogy is the distinction between:
*   **Logos**: Represents factual truth—what actually happened [0:08:48].
*   **Mythos**: Refers to how humans tell stories about themselves, extending fantasy beyond mere facts to imagine what it's like to be human [0:08:51]. This "mythos" must be retold as it is invented and projected onto history and fantasies about the future [0:09:10]. The [[game_b_philosophy | Game B]] concept, for instance, is presented as a distinct "mythos" that proposes "implotation" as a first principle, contrasting with "game a's" idea of infinite exploitation [0:09:21].
*   **Pathos**: Encompasses the "story about sex and violence and the subconscious," including human drives, desires, rivalry, and envy [0:51:38]. It is described as never coherent or balanced, but a fundamental part of humanity that must be dealt with, unlike traditional Western philosophies (Christianity, Islam) that attempted to ban it [0:51:50].

## The Trilogy's Books

The trilogy's development follows a unique "hegelian" approach, starting with the future, then addressing the present, and finally rewriting history [0:04:59].

### 1. *Synthesism: Creating God in the Internet Age*
This first book of the trilogy is built on a specific assumption about human development and technology [0:05:07]:
1.  Woman gives birth to a child [0:05:12].
2.  Man envies woman for giving birth to a child [0:05:16].
3.  Man therefore gives birth to technology [0:05:21].
4.  Since technology develops over time and children do not (remaining "equally stupid" across generations), technology will eventually surpass or at least significantly complement the child [0:05:25].
5.  This leads to the conclusion that humanity is heading towards creating machinery or technology that will either outdo or greatly augment humans, leading life in a new direction [0:05:39].

The book stresses that humans still have a say in the progress of AI and related technologies [0:05:57]. The development of the atomic bomb, demonstrated on August 6, 1945, is cited as a crucial historical date, proving humanity's capacity for self-destruction and highlighting the urgent need to find alternative paths [0:06:05]. The authors advocate for "symbiotic intelligence" over "artificial intelligence," emphasizing technology's inherent connection to humans, who are now considered "homo technological" rather than "homo sapiens" [0:06:36].

### 2. *Digital Libido: Sex, Power and Violence in the Network Society*
This second book focuses on the current state of the "internet age" and the societal challenges expected over the next 50 to 100 years [0:06:57]. It serves as a warning about the messy reality of the internet age, where institutions are fighting back against disruption, and the potential for extinction through atomic warfare [0:07:07]. Jim Rutt notes that the first chapter is a "tour de force" and the first half "really excellent" [0:03:33].

### 3. *Process and Event*
The third book, which was being written at the time of the discussion, is described as a "rewriting of history" [0:07:26]. It proposes a radical shift in the history of ideas, arguing that all important ideas for humanity originated during the Bronze Age, which set the conditions for civilization [0:07:33]. The claim is that humanity hasn't significantly improved upon these ideas, only created technologies to manage larger populations more easily [0:07:47]. The concept emphasizes the "power of historiography" and the ability to reinterpret the past [0:08:33].

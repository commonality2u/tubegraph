The distinction between "complex" and "complicated" is a fundamental concept in [[complexity_science_and_emergentism | complexity science]] and applied [[complexity theory and its critiques | complexity theory]], particularly within frameworks like Cynefin, developed by Dave Snowden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. While often used interchangeably, these terms refer to distinct types of systems with different underlying characteristics and implications for decision-making and management.

## Defining the Terms

### Complicated Systems
The term "complicated" originates from the Latin root meaning "to unfold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. In a complicated system, something that can be folded can also be unfolded, and it remains the same thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Key characteristics:
*   **Decomposability and Reassembly:** Complicated systems can typically be taken apart and put back together again, maintaining their original function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The logic of the system is often implicit in its static design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Predictability:** Humans are generally skilled at creating complicated systems, which offers predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Examples:** A lawnmower motor or a Boeing 777 airplane can be disassembled and reassembled while retaining its functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. An aircraft is considered complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Complex Systems
The term "complex" derives from the Greek origin meaning "entangled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. An entangled system is constantly shifting and changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Key characteristics:
*   **Interdependence and Entanglement:** A [[complexity_in_systems_like_networks_and_fractals | complex system]] is like "bramble bushes in a thicket," where everything is entangled with everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Irreversibility:** You cannot take a [[complexity_in_systems_like_networks_and_fractals | complex system]] apart and put it back together in the same way, because much of the information resides in its dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Non-Linear Causality:** In a complex adaptive system, there is no linear material causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. While modulated, a [[complexity_in_systems_like_networks_and_fractals | complex system]] does not possess causality in a meaningful sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. It may exhibit easily unmappable or even deterministic chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **[[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | Emergence]]:** The properties of the whole system are always different from the properties of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This means new properties [[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | emerge]] from the interactions within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Superconductors are an example: superconductivity emerges when enough electrons clump together, despite being unpredictable from individual electron behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Unintended Consequences:** With complex systems, one can be certain that any action will lead to unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Open Systems:** [[complexity theory and systems thinking | Complexity thinking]] typically deals with systems that are open and have multiple connections, rather than defined boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. [[emergence_and_complexity_in_life | Life]], for instance, is a complex open system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>.
*   **Examples:** A human cell cannot be taken apart into its chemicals and reassembled to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The economy cannot be stopped and restarted without changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Mayonnaise is considered complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Implications for Management and Decision-Making
A critical error occurs when a [[complexity_in_systems_like_networks_and_fractals | complex system]] is mistakenly assumed to be complicated, leading to radically wrong approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This highlights a fundamental [[reductionism_and_complexity | reductionism and complexity]] issue in traditional management.

### Contrast with Systems Thinking
Most [[complexity theory and systems thinking | systems thinkers]] define systems by boundaries, often implying closed systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Conversely, [[complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity thinking]] addresses open systems where connectivity, rather than strict boundaries, is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Managing Complex vs. Complicated
*   **Complicated Systems:** Can generally be "governed" and "contained" through fixed rules and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Approaches like business process re-engineering and scientific management are suited for complicated systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.
*   **Complex Systems:** Cannot be controlled by predicting the outcome. Instead, one must describe the current state and identify immediate next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Management of complex systems focuses on influencing the system's dispositionality rather than dictating specific outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a>.

This distinction emphasizes that different system types require different approaches, and applying methods suited for complicated systems to complex ones can lead to significant failure.

The concepts of sacredness and spirituality are explored through a unique philosophical lens, differentiating between experiential phenomena and metaphysical proposals, and examining their intrinsic relationship with human cognition and meaning-making.

## Sacredness: Inexhaustibility of Reality
John Vervaeke proposes an "idiosyncratic definition of sacredness" as the "inexhaustibility of our reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This definition builds upon the idea that relevance, like Darwinian fitness, is not an essence but a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Sacredness is experienced as a profound enhancement of our relevance realization, indicating how deeply connected an individual is to themselves, to others, and to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.

This perspective views spiritual experiences as manifesting this sacredness, which allows for an "ongoing fount of new intelligibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. For example, reading Plato can be an inexhaustible source of new meaning and transformation, unlike a "Friends episode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>. This contrasts with classical notions of sacredness often tied to "perfection and immobility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>. Vervaeke highlights the Neo-Platonic Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition's concept of *epictasis*, where the sacredness of God is experienced not as a final rest, but as the "ongoing affordance of our continual self-transcendence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.

A critical point is to distinguish between the *experience* of sacredness and metaphysical proposals about its cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>. Vervaeke argues that the word "sacred" has unfortunately become synonymous with "unchallengeable," a meaning he believes is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

## Spirituality: The Core of Cognitive Agency
Vervaeke posits a deep connection between relevance realization and [[the_role_of_spirituality_and_the_concept_of_God | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. [[The Role of Religion and Sacredness | Religio]] is defined as the realization—both in terms of awareness and actualization—of the fundamental connectedness and "fittedness" that lies at the core of our cognitive agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:47">[02:08:47]</a>. This connectedness applies to ourselves as autopoietic beings, to each other as sociocultural beings, and to the world as dynamically evolving cognitive systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:56">[02:20:56]</a>.

[[The Role of Religion and Sacredness | Religio]] is seen as a significant part of the answer to what Vervaeke terms "perennial problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>. These problems—such as modal confusion, absurdity, alienation, and parasitic processing—arise because the very processes that make humans adaptive also make them vulnerable to self-deceptive and self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. Vervaeke suggests that religio, as a meta-meaning system, aims to "steer religio in the right directions away from foolishness and towards flourishing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>.

## Philosophy and Metaphysics
The discussion delves into [[Metaphysics and its relation to scientific concepts | philosophical and metaphysical]] concepts, particularly the nature of "essence." Inspired by Wittgenstein, Vervaeke notes that many categories, like "game," lack an Aristotelian essence (a set of necessary and sufficient conditions shared by all members) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. However, he then brings in Quine's counterpoint: the job of science is to discover categories that *do* have an essence, defined as properties that support the broadest possible explanatory generalizations, like the atomic weight of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This distinction, emphasized by J.S. Mill's concept of "systematic import," highlights that relevance, unlike gold or horses, has no scientific essence; it is a dynamic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

A key critique of traditional approaches is the tendency for cultures to attach claims of metaphysical indispensability to their "mythos" (narrative systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:25">[02:18:25]</a>. This is exemplified by the evolution of Buddhism, where Buddha himself disavowed metaphysical speculation, yet his followers later invented deities and celestial spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:40">[02:29:40]</a>. Vervaeke argues for recapturing the Greek idea of pursuing [[Metaphysics and its relation to scientific concepts | metaphysics]] independently, ensuring it aligns with and is presupposed by scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:34">[02:36:34]</a>.

The "two worlds model," which posits a distinction between a material world and a transcendent spiritual world, is seen as decadent and no longer viable due to the success of scientific and secular revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:52">[02:08:52]</a>. The argument is for a "one world world view" that embraces complexity and emergence while still allowing for rich spiritual experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:43">[02:07:43]</a>.

## The Religion of No Religion: [[Integrating spirituality and science | A New Path]]
Vervaeke's core project is the "religion of no religion" (RTINAR), which he emphasizes he is *not* founding but rather explaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:35">[01:43:35]</a>. This concept proposes a theoretical integration of cognitive science and the "reverse engineering of enlightenment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>. It seeks to draw from the "rich resource" of past ecologies and practices found in [[Philosophical and religious insights | philosophical and religious traditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:15">[02:01:15]</a>, while "leaving behind the now decadent two worlds mythologies and metaphysics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>.

The RTINAR aims to:
*   Cultivate individual and collective ecologies of practices within communities, rooted in a scientific worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:36]</a>.
*   Ameliorate foolishness and afford flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:50">[02:06:50]</a>.
*   Offer a coherent, collective, and self-correcting alternative for those who find existing religions irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:30">[02:08:30]</a>.
*   Respond to Nietzsche's challenge of becoming "worthy" after the "death of God" by being philosophically and scientifically respectable, and existentially transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:23">[02:09:23]</a>.

### The Interplay of Religio, Credo, and Mythos
Central to this new path is the relationship between:
*   **Religio:** The realization of fundamental connectedness, core to cognitive agency.
*   **Credo:** The use of propositions and pictures to distinguish signal from noise, akin to setting criteria in signal detection theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:55">[02:10:55]</a>. Vervaeke argues that credo should always be in the service of religio, constantly evolving and self-correcting, rather than claiming metaphysical necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:24">[02:14:24]</a>.
*   **Mythos:** The use of [[Symbols and Sacredness in Human Cognition and Society | symbols]] and stories, rituals, and celebrations to imaginally augment and enhance the realization of religio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:39">[02:16:39]</a>. Mythos needs to align different kinds of knowing and remain wary of merging with an unquestionable credo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:38">[02:18:38]</a>.

The ideal is a dynamic system where credo and mythos continuously inform and adjust each other based on lived experience and improved understanding of religio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:07">[02:15:07]</a>.

## Reverse Engineering Enlightenment
Vervaeke advocates for "reverse engineering enlightenment," not as a specific historical or religious attainment, but as the process of "overcoming the perennial problems and enhancing religio in a way that's wise and transformatively effective for people's lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:46">[02:50:46]</a>. This approach bypasses the "perplexing complexity and mystique" surrounding traditional enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:16">[02:49:16]</a> and aims to find reliable, systematic ways, informed by cognitive science, to ameliorate problems and foster flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:01">[02:51:01]</a>.

This practical approach suggests specific strategies:
*   **Parasitic Processing:** Cultivating "counteractive dynamical systems" through ecologies of practices (like the Buddhist Eightfold Path) to combat self-deceptive and self-destructive patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:36">[02:53:36]</a>.
*   **Modal Confusion:** Engaging in practices like mindfulness to remember the being mode as distinct from the having mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>.
*   **Reflectiveness Gap:** Cultivating "flow states" (as in Tai Chi or Taoism) to balance the flexibility of reflection with the involvement of impulsivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:09">[02:56:09]</a>.
*   **Absurdity:** Using meditation and contemplation (like in Spinoza or Buddhism) to achieve *prajna* (non-duality), where clashing perspectives interpenetrate meaningfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Wisdom and Meta-Virtue
The article emphasizes that developing [[spirituality_and_consciousness_in_meta_modern_contexts | meta-psychotechnologies]] for enlightenment must be guided by wisdom and meta-virtue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Otherwise, these tools could be used for harmful purposes, such as building a "nightmare" like China's social credit system or creating soldiers without empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:18">[03:18:18]</a>.

Wisdom is seen as the systematic "seeing through illusion and into reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:15">[03:22:15]</a>. It requires developing intellectual virtues in scientists and philosophers, such as balancing humility and courage in defending theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:17">[03:39:17]</a>. Rationality, unlike fixed intelligence, is highly malleable and can be improved through practices like "active open-mindedness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:55">[03:43:55]</a>. This cognitive style involves actively seeking out and seriously considering criticisms, and "steel-manning" opposing arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:31">[03:47:31]</a>. The goal is not necessarily agreement but a "dialogical movement" where both parties gain new insights they couldn't have reached alone, appreciating the "beauty... of the dance of the dialectic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:15">[03:51:15]</a>. This process fosters "real thinking" over "simulated thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:46">[03:51:46]</a>, leading to collective wisdom and a more robust understanding of reality.

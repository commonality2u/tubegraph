## Overview
[[Agentbased Modeling and Simulations | Agent-based modeling]] (ABM) and [[Agentbased Modeling and Simulations | simulation]] are tools used to explore [[Complex Systems and Their Properties | complex systems]]. In the context of [[human performance and flow states | human systems]], their applicability and limitations are distinct from their use in simpler, more predictable domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## Utility and Limitations
[[Agentbased Modeling and Simulations | Agent-based modeling]] and [[Agentbased Modeling and Simulations | simulation]] can be useful when dealing with single agency and clearly defined rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25:00">[27:25:00]</a>. However, their direct application to [[human performance and flow states | human systems]] is often problematic because most [[human performance and flow states | human systems]] involve:
*   Multiple identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>
*   Patterns not solely based on simple rule-based decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:33:00">[27:33:00]</a>
*   Highly interconnected systems where direct cause-and-effect may not be clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>

A significant concern with using [[Agentbased Modeling and Simulations | simulation]] in [[human performance and flow states | human systems]] is the tendency to confuse [[Agentbased Modeling and Simulations | simulation]] with prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>. While [[Agentbased Modeling and Simulations | simulations]] may be historically accurate, they are often problematic for foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>.

### Murray Gell-Mann's Perspective
Physicist Murray Gell-Mann famously stated that the "only valid model of a [[human performance and flow states | human system]] is a system itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>. This suggests that while [[Agentbased Modeling and Simulations | agent-based modeling]] can provide insights and clues into aspects of a system, it does not offer the predictive element that some might seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>.

### Ensemble Statistics and System Behavior
While individual trajectories from [[Agentbased Modeling and Simulations | agent-based models]] may not be predictive, the statistics on the *ensemble* of trajectories can reveal crucial information about the system's underlying dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:59:00">[28:59:00]</a>. For instance, these models can help determine if a system operates in a Gaussian (normal) or a fat-tailed (extremistan) space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>. Understanding this distinction is vital for management, as Gaussian and fat-tailed spaces require very different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>.

In a "Pareto world" (fat-tailed), the best an organization can do is to trigger human beings to a heightened state of alert to examine a situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:00">[29:37:00]</a>. This approach was applied in counterterrorism work for DARPA, where AI was used to trigger a heightened state of alert when a terrorist outrage was more likely, rather than attempting to predict or model the event directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:45:00">[29:45:00]</a>. This technology is being adapted to create "anticipatory triggers" for issues like potential abuse in elderly care homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>.

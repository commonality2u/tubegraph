The concept of **absence** is a fundamental yet often unintegrated idea in scientific thought, influencing our understanding of physics, biology, and mental experience alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. It refers to a range of phenomena, particularly purposes, meanings, and values, which are "about something that's not present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This can be understood as a "constitutive absence," where the very nature of a word, for instance, is linked to what it is *not* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### The Problem of Absence
Scientific theories struggle to incorporate what is absent from physical theories or mental experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. For example, consciousness is always "about something," but that "something" is not the physical "stuff" of consciousness itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This difficulty is akin to how reductionist theories may imply that intentions, which can cause significant physical activity, don't truly exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Everything we do is often with respect to something that does not yet exist, reflecting an underlying absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Historical Context: The Story of Zero
The historical struggle in the West to accept the concept of zero mirrors the scientific difficulty with absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Arabic numerals, by providing a value for nothing, enabled the development of recursive number systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This problem also plagued early philosophy, as seen in Zeno's paradox, where an arrow seemingly never reaches its target due to an infinite number of half-distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The resolution of Zeno's paradox, leading to calculus, involved learning to work with infinitely small divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This suggests that the problem of mind and other complex phenomena may also be rooted in our difficulty dealing with absences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### Absence in Living Systems and Thermodynamics
The essence of being alive lies in maintaining existence against an inherent tendency to break down and disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This relates directly to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that regularities in the world tend to dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. While living processes locally reverse this trend by maintaining order (e.g., a refrigerator staying cold), they do so by performing work that generates *more* entropy in the rest of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

This distinguishes life from simple [[self-organizing_processes | self-organizing processes]] (like whirlpools or snow crystals), which, while producing order by dissipating energy, also accelerate the dissipation of the very gradients that sustain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. The key for life is not just to generate order but to **prevent it from disappearing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This requires a deeper level of organization that uses the "self-destructive" nature of dissipative processes against itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

### Absence as Constraint and Form
The concept of **constraint** is critical to understanding emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Constraints refer to what is *not* happening or what is prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. A form or symmetry is understood not just by what it *is*, but by what variations or features are *not* expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. This "negative" thinking reveals that organization itself is an absence: "the absence of something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. For example, in the formation of salt from sodium and chlorine, new properties emerge because certain relationships (like the individual atoms' normal states) are *no longer there* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

This perspective implies a hierarchy of regularization, where anything less than full variety or chaos is "formed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This means that "new absences can be generated by relationships among previous absences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

### Orthograde and Contragrade Processes
To articulate how systems change, the terms **orthograde** and **contragrade** are introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>:
*   **Orthograde:** Processes of change that happen spontaneously, requiring no work or effort, like the increase of entropy or constant velocity in empty space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. This is "going with the flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
*   **Contragrade:** Processes that go against the spontaneous flow, requiring work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. When two orthograde tendencies are not aligned, they act contragrade to each other, doing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. Generating order in a thermodynamic context is contragrade to the second law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. Even thinking, especially logical or focused thought, is contragrade, while daydreaming is orthograde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

### Three Layers of Emergence and Absence
This framework leads to three levels of [[emergence_and_complexity_science | emergent dynamics]]:
1.  **Homeodynamics:** Orthograde processes that tend towards homogenization or stable equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>. Examples include constant motion or a gas at equilibrium, where the overall structure remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. These are the most pervasive dynamics in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.
2.  **Morphodynamics:** Higher-order, rarer processes that generate order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. These arise from contra-grade interactions that balance each other to produce regularity, such as whirlpools, convection cells, or snow crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. However, they are inherently self-undermining, rapidly dissipating the conditions that create them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.
3.  **Teleodynamics:** The highest and rarest order of emergence, characteristic of living systems and mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. This involves juxtaposing morphodynamic processes that not only produce order but **maintain and reproduce** it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. [[emerge_and_topdown_causality_in_philosophical_and_scientific_frameworks | Teleodynamic]] processes are directed towards an *absent end*, like self-repair or reproduction, constantly working against their tendency to go out of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. This is the only type of process that can truly amplify itself, as seen in the spread of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

### The Autogen Model
The autogen is a thought experiment to concretely illustrate a [[teleodynamics_and_its_implications | teleodynamic]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. It involves two molecular processes:
*   **Reciprocal catalysis:** A system where catalyst A generates catalyst B, and B generates A, leading to a rapid, self-organizing (morphodynamic) increase in their concentration until raw materials are used up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.
*   **Capsid formation:** The crystallization-like growth of a protein shell (capsid) that consumes molecules from the solution, also a morphodynamic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.

In the autogen, the catalytic process produces molecules needed for capsid growth, while the capsid contains the catalysts, preventing their diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. This creates a self-reinforcing system where the catalysts generate the container that preserves them, and the container ensures the catalysts remain localized to continue their reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. This allows for self-repair and reproduction, where the system of *constraints* (absences) is what is passed on, essentially transmitting *information* about how to maintain itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

### Information and Absence
Information, in this framework, is intrinsically linked to physical constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.
*   **Shannon information:** Measures the reduction in variety or the amount of constraint on a signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. It doesn't refer to meaning or usefulness, but to how much message can be transmitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.
*   **Boltzmann entropy:** Represents physical entropy, the tendency for physical systems to degrade and lose constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>. Noise in signal transmission, for instance, is due to these degrading effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.

The distinction between signal and noise is not intrinsic but dependent on an interpreter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>. A physical constraint (like a snow crystal's form) is information about the work that produced it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. This interpretation requires a [[teleodynamics_and_its_implications | teleodynamic]] process that can discern what matters for its own self-maintenance and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

Gregory Bateson's idea of information as "a difference that makes a difference" connects to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. While a thermostat exemplifies a purely physical difference making a difference, in living systems, a difference "matters" if it's necessary for the system's continued existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>. This leads to a "normative character" where things are distinguished as good or bad, useful or dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

### Sentience and Consciousness
**Sentience**, in a broad sense, begins with the capacity of a [[teleodynamics_and_its_implications | teleodynamic]] system to be differentially reactive to its environment in a way that maintains itself and avoids damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:56]</a>. An autogen sensitive to molecules that weaken its structure, breaking open only in supportive environments, exhibits a rudimentary form of sentience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. This establishes a self-other distinction, where the world is divided into what is "good for me" and "bad for me," even without conscious knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>.

This "vegetative sentience" (like in plants) differs from the "subjective sentience" of animals with brains, which involves a representation or model of the world's possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>. Brains develop because motility requires prediction of what's ahead, necessitating a concentration of sensory and processing devices at one end (the "head") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>.

The nervous system itself is a nested [[emergence_and_topdown_causality_in_philosophical_and_scientific_frameworks | teleodynamic]] process within the larger teleodynamic process of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:25">[01:31:25]</a>. Every neuron is teleodynamic, trying to maintain itself while being disturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:29">[01:33:29]</a>. [[concept_of_consciousness | Consciousness]] is a higher-order teleodynamics, where the teleodynamics of brains (making predictions and discerning good/bad) is about the teleodynamics of bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:51">[01:37:51]</a>.

Mental phenomena, such as feeling and thinking, are dynamic processes, not static states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:59">[01:42:59]</a>. A representation is a dynamical form, a "melody" of activity in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:57">[01:44:57]</a>. Attention, which requires effort ("work"), involves balancing these morphodynamic processes—the brain's self-maintenance against incoming stimuli or internal thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:04">[01:46:04]</a>. The role of [[concept_of_consciousness | consciousness]] is often to *make things unconscious* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:04">[01:49:04]</a>, pushing information into automatic processing to resolve contradictions and adapt efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:11">[01:49:13]</a>.

### The Hard Problem and Absence
The "hard problem" of [[concept_of_consciousness | consciousness]] (why does physical brain activity *feel* like something?) is likened to Zeno's paradox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:21">[01:51:21]</a>. The more physical details we know about the brain, the further away the subjective experience seems to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:59">[01:51:59]</a>. This perpetuates a dualistic view, separating mind from matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:14">[01:53:14]</a>.

However, just as calculus resolved Zeno's paradox by re-evaluating zero, the hard problem can be approached by recognizing the fundamental role of **absences** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:16">[01:54:16]</a>. Consciousness and all emergent phenomena arise from systems of constraints (absences) that enable new kinds of work, which in turn produce new kinds of constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Our identity is not the ever-changing physical stuff of our bodies, but rather the "dynamical system of constraints that keeps itself in existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:39">[01:56:39]</a>. This suggests that "new absences" can emerge as fundamentally new phenomena, not merely hidden possibilities, explaining the unique nature of human [[concept_of_consciousness | cognition]], [[metaphysics_and_science_interaction | morality]], and [[metaphysics_and_science_interaction | ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:37">[01:58:37]</a>. The essence of existence is "doing," which is "work," and work requires constraining energy dissipation, leading to the generation of new constraints and new capacities for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>. Ultimately, our experience is on the "side of those absences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:57">[01:58:57]</a>.

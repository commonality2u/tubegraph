Curtis Yarvin, author of the Grey Mirror Substack and founder of the anti-egalitarian and anti-democratic neo-reaction movement (NRX), proposes replacing the current United States government with a monarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This is not a metaphor, but a literal proposal for a king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Critique of Current Democracy

Yarvin argues that the present form of [[political_power_and_systems_in_the_USA | democracy]] is flawed and transitional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>. He views the U.S. government as lacking a true executive branch, with agencies largely micromanaged by legislative bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Members of Congress are seen as largely focused on fundraising and maintaining their positions, with actual legislative work often performed by staff, lobbyists, or activists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. This leads to a situation where the "steering linkage" between elected officials and state policy is "not hooked up at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

Yarvin points out a fundamental contradiction in modern American political thought: the idea that "democracy is good, but putting politicians in charge of the government is bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. He traces this negative characterization of politics back to the early progressive era, when the government was perceived as corrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. He contends that the current system "disconnect[s] the wires from the voters to power very carefully so that they still feel that they matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>, similar to how sports fans support a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. He suggests that the common assumption that democracy truly controls the state is unexamined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Symbolic vs. Objective Realities of Politics

Yarvin differentiates between the symbolic and objective realities of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. He argues that two main goals of democracy, as typically understood, are to collect the "wisdom of crowds" and to make people *feel* that they are in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. He believes the latter, the human "power drive" and desire to feel important, is a neglected part of human psychology that democracy feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

However, Yarvin asserts that if democracy is not fully in control of the state, its primary goal should not be policy-making, but rather gaining and holding power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. He states that political systems are often optimized with a "herbivorous assumption" that they are not contending for power, when in reality, they need to be "carnivorous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

## "Solid Democracy" Thought Experiment

To illustrate his point, Yarvin uses a thought experiment based on "liquid democracy" (a concept where individuals can delegate their votes to others, as discussed in the [[meritocracy_democracy_and_consensus_models | comparison of meritocracy, democracy and consensus models]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. He transforms this into "solid democracy," designed to take and hold power rather than merely articulate policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

Key modifications in "solid democracy" include:
*   **Frozen Delegation**: Instead of being able to change one's proxy at any time, delegation would be frozen for a fixed period (e.g., four years) or even for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. This ensures "unconditional loyalty" and allows leaders to act with more confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.
*   **Centralized Power**: All political power, not just voting, is delegated to a single leader or structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. This allows for a concentration and amplification of power, turning a "disorganized mob" into an army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.
*   **Party Discipline**: Elected representatives would not be independent statesmen but "pretty faces" with a single, combined staff, acting as a unified block with "extremely tight party discipline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   **Psychological Fulfillment**: The system is designed to fulfill people's actual psychological need to "smash their enemies and take power from them," rather than focusing on rationalized policy arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.

Yarvin suggests that such a system, by maximizing power projection upwards, inadvertently "designed a monarchy without knowing that I was constructing a monarchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.

## The Case for Monarchy

Yarvin presents monarchy as the "natural system of government" for a fundamentally apathetic and disengaged population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. He argues that most people today "just want to grill" (live their lives peacefully) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>, and the main driver for political engagement is "collective fear" of the "other side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:47">[01:23:47]</a>.

A monarch, as a singular, unifying force, could "de-escalate that fight" by not governing as the leader of a faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. This could end the "red versus blue conflict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>, leading to universal apathy (in a positive sense, as political conflict disappears) and efficient government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. He envisions a society where cities are cleaned up, infrastructure improves, and people feel they are waking from a "nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

### Historical Precedents and Examples

Yarvin draws on history to support his view:
*   **Roman Empire**: He cites Caesar as an example of a leader who arose from a faction but then governed "all of Rome," bringing peace after centuries of civil conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>.
*   **English Civil War**: He notes that even during the conflict, both sides claimed to be fighting for the king, highlighting the monarchy's enduring popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.
*   **FDR**: Yarvin considers Franklin D. Roosevelt to have essentially become a "monarch" in 1933, wielding personal power far beyond that of later presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>. He argues that America currently lives in the "ruins of a monarchy that decayed into an oligarchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:31">[01:26:31]</a>.
*   **20th Century Dictators**: While acknowledging figures like Hitler and Stalin as "terrible regimes," Yarvin considers them "anomalies" and "attempts at monarchy in the age of democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:30">[01:46:30]</a>. He contrasts them with figures like Portugal's Salazar, an economics professor who "killed off the fascists" and communists to establish a peaceful "new state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:22">[01:44:22]</a>. He also praises Deng Xiaoping as the "greatest political leader of the 20th century" for using absolute power for the good of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:57">[01:45:57]</a>.
*   **1989 Revolutions**: Yarvin points to the peaceful revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe as a template for regime change, where power shifts from the center, leading to "pure joy" and a "feeling of relaxation" rather than violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>.

## Conclusion and Counterpoints

Jim Rutt, the host, acknowledges the logical progression of Yarvin's argument, finding it "interesting and scary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. He suggests that the current brokenness of American politics is a "game theoretic predictable outcome of our institutional structures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>. While intrigued by the idea of a truly unifying monarch, Rutt remains skeptical, citing Winston Churchill's view that "democracy is the worst system except for all the rest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a>. He prefers seeking "new thinking in better forms of [[meritocracy_democracy_and_consensus_models | democracy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:55">[01:49:55]</a>. Yarvin agrees that the question of how to maintain a "benevolent" monarchy is an important one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:21">[01:49:21]</a>.

Forrest Landry, a philosopher and guest on the Jim Rutt Show, discusses his unique approach to metaphysics, contrasting it with historical philosophical traditions and emphasizing its practical utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. His work, known as [[immanent_metaphysics | immanent philosophy]], is presented primarily through a website version that is considered more readable and current than his book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Defining Metaphysics

Jim Rutt initially expresses a common skepticism towards metaphysics, often associating it with ungrounded speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. However, Landry's work is acknowledged as a "serious attempt to build an understanding of the universe for some pretty basic fundamentals," avoiding the typical pitfalls of unsubstantiated claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

Landry defines his domain of metaphysics as an inquiry into the nature of the relation between self and reality, specifically focusing on the interaction between the subjective and the objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Historically, metaphysics addresses two primary questions: "what is" (ontology, the study of existence and the nature of being) and "how do we know" (epistemology, the nature of knowledge and the phenomenology of consciousness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. Other branches like axiology (what's valuable) and aesthetics (what's beautiful) extend from these fundamental metaphysical premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

## Historical Philosophical Context

Landry's work engages with and refines traditional philosophical concepts:

### Aristotle and Kant
Historically, philosophers like [[Historical philosophical shifts and their impact on meaning and agency | Kant]] and [[Historical philosophical shifts and their impact on meaning and agency | Aristotle]] discussed metaphysics often in relation to theology or the nature of the ground of being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

Kant's observation was that perception does not necessarily provide perfect information about what is perceived, nor about the perceiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. If the objective world is treated as real, perception itself doesn't offer perfect information, leading Kant to reject metaphysics as a means to understand objective existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

### Descartes and Cartesian Dualism
Cartesian dualism, particularly famously expressed as "I think, therefore I am," explores the relationship between mind and matter, or subjective consciousness and objective substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>. Descartes' approach sought indubitable ground truth by rejecting anything that could be doubted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

In this framework, the act of thinking (a process) is the basis for establishing being, suggesting that ontology is dependent upon epistemology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

## Forrest Landry's Immanent Metaphysics: A Contemporary Approach

Landry's [[immanent_metaphysics | immanent metaphysics]] differs from traditional views by positing the *relationship* between the subjective and the objective as primary and unconditional, rather than asserting the unconditional existence of either the subjective or the objective alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

Key aspects of Landry's approach:

*   **Relationship as Ontological Class**: The relationship between the perceiver and the perceived, or the process of perception itself, is considered more fundamental than both the perceiver and the perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This relationship, like that between content and context, is its own fundamental notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Refining Concepts**: Landry distinguishes between "to exist," "to be real," and "to be objective," terms often conflated in philosophical literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This careful distinction is crucial for foundational inquiry.
*   **Interaction as Fundamental**: Landry argues that interaction is more fundamental than existence or even creation. To establish that something exists, one must interact with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. Therefore, the process of interaction (e.g., the scientific method) provides the basis of knowledge, rather than a presupposition of deterministic existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Definition of Self**: In this work, the "self" is defined as the product of all choices one has made and all choices one *could* make, encompassing both actuality (memory) and potentiality (capabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This concept links directly to [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]] as a fundamental element of the subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Process as Primal Concept**: Landry identifies process as "probably the single most primal concept" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. Concepts like comparison, measurement, signaling, [[nature_of_choice_in_metaphysics | choice]], change, and causation are all manifestations or examples of the underlying notion of process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:58">[01:49:58]</a>. The axioms and modalities explore the intrinsic characteristics of process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.
*   **Relation vs. Interaction**: A key distinction is made between "relation" (atemporal, like in mathematics, focusing on structures) and "interaction" (temporal, involving flow of information and change, like in physics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. An observer is considered an "epiphenomenon of the interaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>, implying that the concept of an observer is inherent in the notion of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
*   **Reifying Power**: Rather than seeking absolute "proof" (which he relates to mathematical validity), Landry focuses on "soundness" for metaphysics, which is a "very practical" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. Soundness in metaphysics is about the "reifying power" of conceptsâ€”their ability to clarify vague relationships and improve understanding and utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:44">[00:52:44]</a>. This is analogous to how scientific experiments clarify questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.
*   **Mind from Brain**: Landry acknowledges that neuroscience can show correlations between subjective experience and brain tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. However, he argues that even perfect knowledge of neural correlates would not answer the "hard problem" of consciousness, which deals with *why* a subjective experience is happening *now*, emphasizing the role of time and inherent potentiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. This distinction between first-person and third-person perspectives is crucial; while science moves from first-person observation to third-person understanding, the reverse (deriving first-person experience from third-person models) requires a different philosophical toolset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>.

Landry suggests that [[Metaphysics and science interaction | physics]] helps answer "why" questions through modeling, while metaphysics is for answering "what" questions through descriptive processes, aiming to create clear concepts for use in other fields like computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. The value of metaphysics lies not in producing testable experiments, but in clarifying concepts that *lead* to testable experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

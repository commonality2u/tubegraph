In a discussion on the Jim Rutt Show, guests Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin provided a critical perspective on traditional [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity theory]] and introduced their "Assembly Theory" as an alternative approach that redefines the understanding of [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity]].

## Traditional Measures of Complexity

Sarah Walker, an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist, notes that traditional measures from computer science, such as [[complexity_theory_and_systems_thinking | Kolmogorov complexity]], focus on "program size complexity" â€“ the minimal machine required to run a program [01:28:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:24">[01:28:24]</a>. This approach is often "uncomputable" because it requires searching over all possible machines for the minimal description [01:36:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>.

### Critiques of Traditional [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | Complexity Theory]]

Lee Cronin, a chemist, offers a blunt assessment of existing [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity theory]]:
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:05">[02:25:05]</a> "[[Complexity theory and systems thinking | Complexity theory]] is not none of it's correct and it's one of the biggest errors that a lot of people have made."

Cronin cites a letter from Freeman Dyson, who wrote:
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a> "I should add the whole literature of [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity theory]] suffers from the same deficiency that experts call it [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity theory]] but in fact there is no theory there are a lot of interesting examples of complex objects and complex systems but no General understanding their behavior and the collection of examples not a theory if it provides no understanding."

Cronin suggests that [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity theory]] "was generated by computation lists fascinated with computation and Turing machines" [02:04:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:06">[02:04:06]</a>, acting as an "excuse to not actually do your accounting properly" by collecting and binning things to produce a number [02:25:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:25">[02:25:25]</a>. Jim Rutt, the host, largely agrees, viewing the field as "exploring" phenomena without a "unified theory yet" [02:44:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

A key limitation highlighted by Sarah Walker is that traditional measures of [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity]] "can't distinguish random from complex" [01:56:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:58">[01:56:58]</a>, as random things can appear very complex due to their unstructured nature [02:02:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01">[02:02:01]</a>.

## Assembly Theory: A New Measure of [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | Complexity]]

In contrast to these traditional views, Assembly Theory proposes a different way to measure and understand [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity]], rooted in the physical properties and causal history of objects.

### Core Concepts

Assembly Theory assesses an object's [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity]] based on two main components [01:46:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>:
1.  **Number of parts**: The number of distinct components an object possesses [01:48:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>.
2.  **Number of identical objects**: How many identical copies of that object exist [01:49:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.

The theory asks: "How unlikely is this object to form probabilistically by chance?" [01:10:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. For example, finding ten identical iPhone 14s on Mars would strongly suggest they did not form by chance [01:36:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>.

### Assembly Steps and Causal Pathways

Assembly Theory focuses on the "minimal set of causal pathways for making the object" [01:19:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>. This involves recursively decomposing an object into its components and identifying the "shortest route" or least number of "steps" required to reform it, allowing for the reuse of components [01:25:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>.

*   **Recursivity**: Only parts already built in the past can be used [01:22:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. This implies that "every object encodes its own memory" [01:22:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.
*   **Physical Attribute**: The minimal path is considered a "physical attribute of the object" [01:34:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:36">[01:34:36]</a>, meaning the object is "extended in time" [01:38:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>.
*   **Measurement**: Assembly theory began with the "profound insight" of being experimentally measurable [02:09:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:11">[02:09:11]</a>. Techniques like spectroscopy, magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry can reveal the number of different parts in a molecule, providing a measurable "assembly index" [03:00:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:27">[03:00:27]</a>.

### Distinguishing Random from Complex

Unlike traditional [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity measures]], Assembly Theory differentiates between random and complex objects:
*   "Random objects are really hard to make" in Assembly Theory [02:08:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>.
*   It focuses on objects that demonstrate "reuse of parts," a characteristic seen in [[Complexity theory and evolution of life | evolution]] [02:21:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:23">[02:21:23]</a>. High [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity]] objects arise from a "memory of what existed in the past and reusing those features" [02:29:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:34">[02:29:34]</a>.
*   This approach is concerned with "the causal chain and how complex is that and can that even form based on finite resources finite time" [02:02:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01">[02:02:01]</a>.

### Memory, Selection, and the Origin of Life

Assembly Theory posits that objects encode their own memory through the recursive process of their construction [01:22:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>. This concept of memory is crucial for the creation of high [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity]] structures, such as large organic molecules, which are dependent on the "deep memory in DNA and the local memory in the cytoplasm" [03:22:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This aligns with the idea that the universe's evolution involves an increasing ability to take more steps as memory gets deeper and more complicated [03:52:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

A key outcome of Assembly Theory is the idea that "selection has to predate biology as we know it" [03:52:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Without pre-biological selection, the emergence of [[Complexity theory and evolution of life | complexity]] would require a "miracle" [03:52:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Assembly Theory suggests a mechanism where selection initially builds steps randomly, and then mechanisms for memory are built by the universe [03:52:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

The theory also reveals a "sharp phase transition" between non-biotic and biotic chemistry, which appears around 13 or 14 "steps" [04:25:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:27">[04:25:27]</a>. Objects with 15 steps or above are considered to require a biotic origin [04:25:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:27">[04:25:27]</a>. This threshold represents a point where a "mechanism must be in place in order to observe those High assembly objects" [04:39:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:57">[04:39:57]</a>, arising from the combinatorial explosion of possibility space [04:48:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:40">[04:48:40]</a>. Assembly Theory provides a "meaningful way of talking about when systems cross that boundary" between non-living and living, using a unified descriptive language [04:54:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:55">[04:54:55]</a>.

### Assembly Theory as a Theory of Time

Sarah Walker argues that Assembly Theory is "a theory of time" [00:58:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. Unlike abstract concepts of information, Assembly Theory aims to make information material, as it is "accumulated over time" and is a "temporarily embedded structure" [00:59:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. This means the "molecule is not the thing I hold in my hand it's actually this extended temporal structure that captures these evolutionary informational properties" [01:00:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.

This perspective challenges the "block universe" view of Einstein, where all times exist at once and novelty does not exist [01:03:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. Assembly Theory suggests that "some things have to happen before other things can happen" [01:02:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>, making it fundamentally incompatible with the block universe concept [01:02:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>. Cronin highlights that the universe expands in a way that "creates options," meaning "there are more options in the future than around the past" [01:04:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. This inherent asymmetry is a core tenet, supported by particle physics' observation of CP violation [01:17:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Thus, Assembly Theory reveals time by showing that complex objects have "depth and time" â€“ a cell, for instance, has a lineage stretching back billions of years [01:05:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>.

Ultimately, Assembly Theory offers a framework that grounds [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity]] in measurable physical attributes and causal histories, presenting a critical alternative to established [[Complexity theory and systems thinking | complexity theory]] paradigms and even proposing a new understanding of time itself.

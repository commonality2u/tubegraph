Forrest Landry's work, particularly his "imminent philosophy," delves deeply into the fundamental nature of choice and its implications for understanding the universe and making effective decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This philosophical undertaking aims to build an understanding of the universe from basic fundamentals, rather than relying on abstract, unprovable metaphysical assertions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Why Study the Nature of Choice?

Landry emphasizes the importance of understanding choice, especially given contemporary challenges like existential risk and civilization design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. These grand challenges often relate to ethical concerns and values, necessitating a clear grasp of what choice is, how it's made, and even if it's real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. There is significant debate within the scientific community regarding concepts like [[Determinism vs free will debate | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. A deeper understanding of these concepts can inform how we approach [[Community credit and decisionmaking | choice-making at community levels]], ensuring it is sensible and grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance individual and collective [[Principles of effective choice | choice making]] and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Metaphysics and Choice

Landry defines his metaphysics as an inquiry into "the nature of the relation between self and reality," specifically "the interaction between the subjective and the objective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional metaphysics, which often concerns "the nature of the ground of being" or theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Landry's approach considers the relationship between the subjective (the perceiver) and the objective (the perceived) as foundational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The *process* of perception is seen as more fundamental than the perceiver or the perceived themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### The Self and Choice

In Landry's work, the "self" is defined as "the product of all the choices you have made and all the choices you could make" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This includes memory (past choices) and capabilities (future choices), forming a "product space" that considers both actuality and potentiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. This characterization grounds the notion of self in choice, providing a framework for understanding complex philosophical concepts like ethics and aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Choice, Change, and Causation

Landry posits a fundamental "triplicate" of choice, change, and causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>:
*   **Change** relates to the nature of the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Causation** relates to the nature of the object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Choice** relates to the nature of the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

Understanding the intrinsics of choice is crucial for developing [[Principles of effective choice | principles of effective choice]] and making "good choices or wise choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

## Interaction vs. Relation

A key distinction in Landry's work is between *interaction* and *relation*:
*   **Relation** is atemporal; it concerns mathematical structures or timeless truths. If a mathematical proof is true, "it has always been true before I even knew that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Interaction** inherently has a temporal element, involving a "before" and "after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. It represents the flow of information from the objective to the subjective, and the moment this occurs is an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. This implies concepts like temporality, flow of information, and the existence of other possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

The concept of an observer is implied in the notion of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. When attempting to verify something's existence, an interaction is required, positing "the potentiality of verifying that the moon does in fact exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. This shifts the basis of knowing from a prior assumption of deterministic existence to the interaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

### The Role of Metaphysics: Reifying Power

Landry's metaphysics is less about "proof" in the mathematical sense (validity) and more about "soundness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. Soundness is a practical measure of whether a model or concept from one domain can clarify or correspond to another domain, enabling "applicability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

This utility is termed "reifying power," which means taking something vague and making it more definite or structured, increasing its clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. It's about enhancing the usefulness and trustworthiness of concepts, allowing for reliable action and better [[Principles of effective choice | decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. The more a concept can clarify something vague into something clear, the greater its reifying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Mind from Brain and the Hard Problem of Consciousness

Landry acknowledges the strong correspondence between subjective experience and brain tissue observed in neuroscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. However, he argues that even perfected knowledge of neural correlates would not answer the "hard problem" of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>. This problem concerns *why* a particular moment is "this one" â€“ the qualitative, subjective nature of experience, or qualia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

Neural correlations describe "what's happening," but don't inherently explain the temporal element of *now* or the distinction between past and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>. The hard problem arises because a "first-person perspective" (subjective experience) cannot be fully derived from a purely "third-person orientation" (objective, physical description) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:33">[01:22:33]</a>.

Landry's metaphysics attempts to bridge this gap by starting from the premise that the relationship between the subjective and objective is unconditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. It seeks to characterize the intrinsic nature of *process* itself, which underlies comparison, measurement, signaling, and even the core concepts of choice, change, and causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. This "process ground" is fundamental, implying that even the act of "doubt about doubt" presupposes the concept of doubt itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. Consciousness, like time, is intrinsic to the notion of process and involves a "symmetry breaking" that localizes experience to a specific time, space, and possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.

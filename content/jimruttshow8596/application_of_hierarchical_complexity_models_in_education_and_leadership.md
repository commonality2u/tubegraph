[[Hierarchical complexity]] is a concept studied in psychology, emerging from the field of [[Hierarchical Complexity and its emergence in psychology | developmental psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Its application extends to education and leadership, providing a framework for understanding and fostering cognitive growth and skill acquisition.

## Understanding Hierarchical Complexity

The notion of [[Hierarchical complexity and its emergence in psychology | hierarchical complexity]] first emerged almost a century ago with Jean Piaget's 1923 publication, "The Language and Thought of the Child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Earlier hints can be found in the works of James Mark Baldwin and Herbert Spencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. It's considered a ubiquitous property of mental processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

In the 1980s and 1990s, a "neo-Piagetian consensus" emerged, formally defining stages across lifespan development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This consensus distilled a core property that characterizes the fundamental developmental differences seen from infancy to advanced theoretical thinking, providing universal characteristics of development across lifespan and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. [[Hierarchical complexity]] became a measurable construct in psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### [[Difference between hierarchical and horizontal complexity | Hierarchical vs. Horizontal Complexity]]

*   **[[Difference between hierarchical and horizontal complexity | Horizontal complexity]]** refers to doing more of the same task at the same level of complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. For example, tying a thousand shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, or performing a sequence of discrete, independent tasks like taking an elevator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **[[Difference between hierarchical and horizontal complexity | Vertical]]** or [[Hierarchical complexity]] involves performing a qualitatively more complex task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. An example is making a shoe versus tying a shoelace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. A more complex example would be disassembling, replacing a part, and reassembling a lawnmower engine, where each step is interdependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

All skills involve some degree of [[Hierarchical complexity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The transition from manipulating individual shoelaces to tying a knot is a basic example of hierarchical integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This process involves many lower-order skills becoming a single, qualitatively new, more complex skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Hierarchical Integration and "Chunking"

The concept of [[Hierarchical complexity]] is closely related to "chunking," where a lot of information can be loaded into a single term or concept as experience grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. For example, a baby's many sensory-motor experiences of getting ready for bed, brushing teeth, etc., become integrated into the single representation "bedtime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. These representations can then be further integrated into abstractions, such as "quality family time," which generalizes across "bedtime," "dinner time," and "TV time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

This process of hierarchical integration is fundamental to the construction of skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It's a ubiquitous property, extending to reflexes and nervous system action, like the eye's signal-noise distillation for the visual cortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Early psychologists like William James and Charles Sanders Peirce observed aspects of [[Hierarchical complexity]] as a basic property of the nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

### [[Complexity Science and Emergence | Emergence]] and [[Complexity Science and its Applications | Hierarchical Complexity]]

[[Hierarchical complexity]] aligns with [[Emergence and Complexity Science | complexity science]]'s understanding of [[Emergence and Complexity Science | emergence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. [[Complexity Science and its Applications | Complexity science]] describes the emergence of multiple levels of complexity from simplicity, as seen in the progression from atoms to cells to multicellular organisms to ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. [[Hierarchical complexity]] in cognition is another example of this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

Kurt Fischer, a prominent neo-Piagetian, pioneered the application of [[Complexity Science and its Applications | dynamical systems modeling techniques]] from [[Complexity Science and its Applications | complexity science]] to model human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. This approach views the individual mind-brain as a complex ecosystem with organic processes of emergence and regression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

### Drivers of Hierarchical Complexity

The primary driver for the emergence of [[Hierarchical complexity]] is thought to be the limited capacity of working memory (e.g., Miller's 7 Â± 2 for sound, or 3-4 for images) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. To process more difficult problems, the brain must make "chunks" of information bigger, allowing more complex concepts to be held simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

However, the "working memory bottleneck" is not the sole driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. Two other factors are crucial:
1.  **Demands of the world**: The inherent complexity and abstraction of the environment necessitate increasingly complex cognitive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
2.  **Epistemic motivation**: Humans possess an innate drive to understand, beyond merely succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. This motivation propels information through the memory bottleneck to higher levels of complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

The lawful, non-random nature of the universe is also important; if patterns were truly random, investing in the biological cost of extracting abstract patterns would be useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

### Stages of Hierarchical Complexity

Within the neo-Piagetian framework, various models like Michael Commons's orders of [[Hierarchical complexity]], Kurt Fischer's skill levels, and Theo Dawson's Lectical Levels are largely isomorphic, triangulating a similar underlying reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. These models propose multiple tiers of development, such as:

*   **Actions (Sensory-Motor)**: The earliest stage, where infants develop skills like focusing vision, reaching, grasping, and drinking from a cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This stage is crucial, and deprivation of rich sensory-motor environments can lead to developmental delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.
*   **Representations**: The emergence of symbols or words to summarize sprawling sensory-motor experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. Children can entertain counterfactuals, lie, and construct complex narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.
*   **Abstractions**: Integrating many representations into higher-order concepts that cannot be directly pointed to, such as "quality family time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. This level is crucial for civilization and requires formal education, enabling hypothetical-deductive reasoning and understanding of democratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Principles (Meta-Systematic)**: The highest levels, involving multi-systemic integration of different fields or ethical frameworks, allowing for the norming of norms and making rules about rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.

It's important to note that development is highly domain-specific; individuals can operate at different levels of [[Hierarchical complexity]] in different areas of their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. This contradicts simplistic "color-coded" stage theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.

### [[Role of hierarchical complexity in human development and skill acquisition | Hierarchical Complexity]] and "General Intelligence"

While there are correlations between [[Hierarchical complexity]] and "general intelligence" (Spearman's g) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>, they are not the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. "General intelligence" is viewed as a summary statistic, whereas [[Hierarchical complexity]] is assigned to a specific task or performance, not an entire person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. Classifying individuals or populations by a single "intelligence number" is seen as an oversimplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a> and a holdover from eugenics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.

## Application in Education and Leadership

### Lectica and Developmental Assessments

Lectica, co-founded by Zach Stein and Theo Dawson, developed a psychometric system based on [[Hierarchical complexity]] to reform standardized testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Theo Dawson pioneered applying psychometric tools, specifically the Rasch model, to [[Hierarchical complexity]] to create standardized cognitive development assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.

These Lectical assessments aim to replace traditional standardized tests, which merely pass or fail, with diagnostic tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>. They identify what a person understands and suggest the next best thing for them to learn, based on empirically grounded learning sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>.

### [[Complexity Science in Organizational Context | Leadership Development]]

Lectica's work extended to adult contexts, particularly [[Complexity Science in Organizational Context | leadership development]] in business and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. The early work involved identifying and developing leaders in the intelligence community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>.

A key insight was the "complexity gap" between the increasing demands of leadership roles and the capacities of leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. While leaders might be highly complex in their technical or engineering problem-solving skills, struggles often emerged in the domains of:
*   **Perspective taking**: The ability to imagine another's viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.
*   **Perspective seeking**: Proactively seeking out the perspectives of others (e.g., employees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.
*   **Perspective integration**: The ability to synthesize multiple perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

Lectica developed learning sequences specifically addressing perspective-taking skills in leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>. It was observed that individuals highly developed in one area of expertise might have a "complexity deficit" in others and fail to recognize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>. For example, a medical doctor might apply pattern-matching algorithms from their field inappropriately to investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.

The shift in management structures from rigid hierarchies to flatter organizations, with managers overseeing more direct reports, likely contributed to the stress on perspective-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>. Furthermore, non-democratic or zero-sum competitive work environments can disincentivize perspective-taking and seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>.

Lectical assessments for leaders use open-ended essays to evaluate decision-making complexity on the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. The goal is not hiring or firing but promoting [[Complexity Science in Organizational Context | leadership development]] by providing diagnostic reports that support growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>. These measures are designed to be more "ecologically valid" than generic psychometric tests, directly relating to job performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.

The application of [[Hierarchical complexity]] in these domains highlights the need for careful and responsible use of quantitative assessments, ensuring they support development rather than merely classifying or judging individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14">[01:26:14]</a>.

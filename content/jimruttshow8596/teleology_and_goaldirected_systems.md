Traditional scientific thought often dismisses the concept of [[concept_of_purpose_and_teleology | teleology]], associating it with religious or mystical notions of divine purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. However, a modern, naturalistic understanding redefines [[concept_of_purpose_and_teleology | teleology]] as the presence of goal-directed behavior or purposeful movement within [[Systems thinking and decision making | systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. This perspective views [[Causality and Free Will in Complex Systems | agency]] and a statistical tendency toward increasing complexity as key aspects of [[concept_of_purpose_and_teleology | teleological]] processes in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

## Naturalizing Teleology
Early cyberneticists in the 1930s and 1940s began discussing [[concept_of_purpose_and_teleology | teleological systems]] specifically as [[goal-directed systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>. Unlike inanimate objects, such as a rock, which moves only due to external forces like gravity or wind, living organisms exhibit [[goal-oriented behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. This seemingly purposeful movement is not due to a "vital force" or "elan vital," but rather a product of the [[information]] encoded within the [[Systems thinking and decision making | system]] through [[Complex systems and societal evolution | evolutionary processes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. These processes build up "adaptive information" or "knowledge" that enables the organism to survive and persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.

## Information, Agency, and Evolution
The [[Causality and Free Will in Complex Systems | emergence]] of [[Causality and Free Will in Complex Systems | agency]] is tied to the evolution of [[information processing systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:29">[01:49:29]</a>. Even simple organisms like bacteria exhibit [[Causality and Free Will in Complex Systems | intelligent]] behavior, such as chemotaxis (swimming towards food and away from toxins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. This implies a rudimentary [[statistical model]] or mapping of the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

[[phylogenetic_learning | Phylogenetic learning]], or generational learning, is the primary mechanism by which [[information]] is accumulated and refined over evolutionary time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. Through blind variation and natural selection, dysfunctional designs are "weeded out," and designs that can effectively predict and adapt to the environment are retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. This makes [[Darwinian evolution]] a form of [[knowledge creation]] and condensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>, as organisms become increasingly statistically correlated with their environment, reducing uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. The biosphere itself can be seen as a "memory system" encoding adaptive solutions to the problem of staying far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

Karl Popper's concept of conjecture and refutation in science, where theories are tested and those that prove predictive survive, is strikingly similar to biological [[evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. Organisms are essentially "embodied theories" about how to survive, and natural selection acts as a filter for this knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. This leads to the [[Bayesian brain hypothesis]], where the brain's function is to minimize prediction error, constantly updating its [[world model]] through interaction with the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

## Thermodynamics and Progress
The [[second law of thermodynamics]] describes the universe's tendency toward increasing disorder in closed [[Systems thinking and decision making | systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. However, living [[Systems thinking and decision making | systems]] are *open systems*, receiving energy from their environment (like Earth from the sun) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This energy flow pushes [[Systems thinking and decision making | systems]] "far from equilibrium," leading to the spontaneous [[Emergence and topdown causality in philosophical and scientific frameworks | emergence]] of [[organization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Life is a form of "adaptive complexity" that extracts energy to evade this tendency toward disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

This perspective implies a [[Process philosophy | process]] of "progress" in [[Complex systems and societal evolution | evolution]], not necessarily meaning every species becomes more complex, but that the overall process leads to increasingly complex life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. This is driven by the continual [[niche_emergence | emergence of new niches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>, where new species create new [[Complex systems and societal evolution | environmental challenges]] (e.g., being a food source for another species), necessitating more sophisticated adaptations in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. The "law of requisite variety" suggests that an organism's complexity must match the complexity of its [[environmental challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>.

## Cosmic Teleology
Zooming out, the grand narrative of [[cosmic evolution]] can be viewed as a [[Process philosophy | process]] of [[cosmic self-organization]], where nature's simplest components spontaneously organize into larger, functional units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. This includes [[evolutionary transitions]] like the formation of multicellularity or societies, where units cooperate because it makes their "thermodynamic task" (energy extraction) easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

Figures like Teilhard de Chardin, with his concept of the "noosphere" (a global integrated mind) and the "omega point" (an optimally complex state of a [[system]]), also touched upon this idea of cosmic teleology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:43">[01:26:43]</a>. The internet, for example, is seen by some as a manifestation of this noosphere, connecting human minds in a "global brain" performing collective computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>.

This view suggests that [[Complex systems and the emergence of order | adaptive complexity]] is fundamentally self-correcting and capable of continuous development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. If intelligent life can develop the technology to leave its planet of origin and utilize energy from stars, its spread can be essentially limitless, as long as free energy is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. The universe, or even a multiverse (as explored by [[Lee Smolin's evolutionary universe theory]] of [[cosmological natural selection]]), could be viewed as a [[self-organizing adaptive system]] with a "cosmic goal" of generating novelty, life, and [[consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:52">[01:59:52]</a>. This perspective naturalizes the concept of purpose within the grand unfolding of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:52">[01:59:52]</a>.

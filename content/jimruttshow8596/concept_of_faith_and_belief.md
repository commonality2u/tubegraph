The concepts of faith and belief, particularly within a theological or philosophical context, are explored, distinguishing between purely mental operations and existential commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. This discussion highlights the distinction between a "nominal belief" (a fixation on a particular set of words or ideas) and "faith" as a deeply embodied, lived experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.

## Belief as Ideology vs. Existential Commitment

Jordan Hall argues that the conventional understanding of "belief" often refers to a "strictly mental operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>, or a "fixation on particular set of words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>. This can be seen as "doctrine" or "ideology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. In this sense, belief might involve simply assenting to specific statements or narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:52">[01:32:52]</a>.

In contrast, "faith" (from the Greek word *pistis*) is presented as an "existential commitment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a> or "livingness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. This concept emphasizes the active engagement with reality rather than mere intellectual assent to ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:58">[01:29:58]</a>.

### Platonic Roots of "Pistis"

To further define *pistis*, its historical usage in Plato's work is examined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:40">[01:35:40]</a>. Plato identified three forms of belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:55">[01:35:55]</a>:
*   **Doxa**: Nonsensical, superficial opinions, often likened to "children's stories" or "journalism" that doesn't convey true reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:38">[01:36:38]</a>. This aligns with Jim Rut's view of [[role_of_religion_and_spirituality | religion]] as "DOXA producing engine" used for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>.
*   **Episteme**: The ability to perceive underlying principles and understand platonic forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:16">[01:37:16]</a>. This is a high-level intellectual understanding, which Plato considered the "crown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>.
*   **Pistis**: Represents "mastery" and "deeply intimate relationship with some domain of reality" through "engaged experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>. It refers to the implicit knowledge gained through practice, like a surfer or an F1 driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:01">[01:38:01]</a>. It's the "music" rather than just the "words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:21">[01:38:21]</a>.

### Faith as a Relationship with Reality

This understanding suggests that faith is not a "maximally delusional belief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:09">[01:28:09]</a>, but rather the opposite: a cultivation of a "well-honed, harmonious, rich, nuanced, subtle, intimate relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:53">[01:38:53]</a> with reality. It is the ability to engage with the world, take risks, and navigate life effectively based on deep confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:55">[01:39:55]</a>.

> "Your ability to navigate life well is to say is a is sitting on top of your faith, sitting on top of the things that you have deep confidence in, right, that existential commitment your ability to actually say I will I will put myself or the things I love at risk on the basis of this stuff because I have cultivated the capacity to be able to make that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>

## Faith, Religion, and Christianity

The concept of faith is further distinguished from "religion" (*religio*), which etymologically means "binding together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:45">[01:40:45]</a>. Religion, in this sense, can be seen as an artificial structure or institution built by humans to cope with being "separated from the wholeness of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:54">[01:40:54]</a>.

However, Jordan Hall argues that a properly understood [[existence_of_god_and_christianity | Christian Trinity]] aligns with this deeper notion of *pistis*. He suggests that Christianity, when understood as "becoming Disciples of Christ or learning to live in accordance with what Christ teaches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:34">[01:41:34]</a>, is an invitation to "enter into full, rich, nuanced, complete faith relationship with embodied relationship with the actual whole of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:44">[01:41:44]</a>. This perspective resonates with [[the_concept_of_a_religion_that_is_not_a_religion | John Vervaeke's concept of a religion that is not a religion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>.

This view implies that one's lived experience of engaging with reality and seeking to live a "wholesome life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:09">[01:44:09]</a> is a form of faith, even if one explicitly rejects traditional religious dogmas. Jim Rut, despite being a "scoffer with respect to [[role_of_religion_and_spirituality | religion]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>, acknowledges that his life of engagement and pursuit of meaning aligns with this definition of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>.

### Humility and Mystery

A key aspect of this faith is humility. The [[existence_of_god_and_christianity | Christian God]] is described as "mysterious" and "intrinsically beyond your capacity to understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:24">[01:50:24]</a>. Faith is not about grasping God with an ideology, but rather entering into a qualitative relationship with that mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:41">[01:50:41]</a>. This "personal relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:53">[01:55:53]</a> with reality (or God) involves meeting the whole of it with the whole of oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:58">[01:55:58]</a>.

Ultimately, the concept of faith, in this expanded sense, is not about adhering to specific doctrines or [[impact_of_culture_and_tradition_on_belief_systems | cultural traditions]], but about actively cultivating a rich, embodied relationship with the entirety of existence.

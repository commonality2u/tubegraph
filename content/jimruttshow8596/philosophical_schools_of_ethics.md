The Jim Rutt Show frequently discusses resources and insights related to [[philosophy_and_ethics_in_modern_society | philosophy and ethics]], with full transcripts and links to referenced materials available on their website [00:00:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Forrest Landry, a thinker, writer, and [[philosophy_and_ethics_in_modern_society | philosopher]], has been a recurring guest, often exploring topics like his imminent metaphysics [00:00:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. One key area of discussion has been his concept of [[nonrelativistic_ethics | non-relativistic ethics]] [00:01:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Forrest Landry's Non-relativistic Ethics

Forrest Landry's approach to [[nonrelativistic_ethics | non-relativistic ethics]] distinguishes itself by asserting the existence of universal principles that are not contingent on specific situations or individual choosers [00:05:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This means what is "right to do" doesn't change based on environment [00:04:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Landry's [[nonrelativistic_ethics_and_values | non-relativistic ethics]] integrates aspects of three major [[historical_philosophical_influences | historical schools of philosophical thought]] concerning ethics [00:03:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, [00:04:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>:

### Historical Schools of Ethical Philosophy

*   **Consequentialist School**
    *   This school evaluates ethics based on the result or consequences of an action [00:02:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   Utilitarianism is a well-known example, measuring the "greatest happiness for the greatest numbers" [00:02:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Deontological School**
    *   Based on reason or a deep, universal morality [00:02:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   Kant's categorical imperative, which suggests behaving as if everyone else would do the same, is an example [00:02:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Virtue Ethics**
    *   An older school, famously propagated by Aristotle, focusing on right behavior from an internal perspective (e.g., courage, truthfulness, temperance) [00:02:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. It is currently experiencing a comeback [00:02:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Landry's framework begins with a [[nonrelativistic_ethics_and_values | values]]-based orientation akin to virtue ethics [00:06:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, then moves into a foundational (deontological) perspective of universal principles for good choices [00:07:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It also considers consequentiality, but from an "integrity point of view" rather than pure purpose [00:07:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Key Concepts in Landry's Ethics

### Effective Choice

At the core of Landry's [[nonrelativistic_ethics | ethics]] is the concept of "effective choice" [00:09:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. An effective choice accomplishes two things:
1.  It has a consequence, making something happen in the world [01:0:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:32">[01:0:32]</a>.
2.  It preserves or increases the potential for future choices [01:0:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:38">[01:0:38]</a>.
This focus on capacity building and potentiality is similar to the economic concept of "optionality" [01:11:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. All choices are uncertain, and one can never know all consequences, implying that ethics must account for incomplete information and the limits of prediction due to chaos and complexity [01:13:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

### Ethics vs. Morality

Landry distinguishes between ethics and morality to highlight the general principles of choice [01:13:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>:
*   **Ethics:** Focuses on universal principles of choice, applicable across different "worlds" or domains of action (e.g., online, workplace, family) [01:15:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. It pertains to what lives in the [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self]] as a guide for effective choice, independent of specific situations [01:16:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.
*   **Morality:** Refers to specific rules or codes particular to a "game" or world (e.g., rules of a sport) [01:16:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>. Landry notes that systems of morality defined in black-and-white terms can be problematic if they are too rigid and fail to adapt to changing circumstances [01:19:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>. While once stating that black-and-white moralities are "antithetical to life," he has softened this stance, recognizing the value of well-calibrated rule systems like legal codes for reducing cognitive load and building good habits [01:17:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>, [01:18:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

### Integrity

Integrity is a primary concept in Landry's framework, meaning "to act as one together" (from *integras*) [01:36:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:44">[01:36:44]</a>. It involves coherency, cooperativeness, and diversity combining efforts to produce results greater than the sum of their parts [01:37:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:06">[01:37:06]</a>. Ethics, as a set of [[ethics_practices_and_the_future_trajectory_of_humanity | practices]], comes from understanding integrity in terms of:
*   The chooser's integrity [01:37:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:51">[01:37:51]</a>.
*   The world's integrity as affected by choices [01:37:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:54">[01:37:54]</a>.
*   The capacity-building of the "channel of connection" between [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self]] and reality [01:37:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:57">[01:37:57]</a>.

### Symmetry and Continuity

To maximize potentiality and integrity in the relationship between the subjective [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self]] and objective reality, one must maximize "the combination of symmetry and continuity" [01:39:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:17">[01:39:17]</a>.
*   **Symmetry:** Refers to the correspondence between what is at one end of a communication channel (subjective) and what is at the other (objective) [01:41:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:07">[01:41:07]</a>. Degradation occurs if there's an absence of correspondence [01:41:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:26">[01:41:26]</a>.
*   **Continuity:** Relates to the smoothness of the energy transmission through the channel, avoiding abrupt shifts in intensity that could break communication [01:42:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>.

These two concepts have a conjugate relationship; perfect smoothness might mean no signal, but no signal means no symmetry either, implying that both are necessary but not perfectly achievable [01:44:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a>.

### Value, Meaning, and Purpose

These three concepts form a [[triad_structures_in_philosophy | triple aspect]] that are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable [01:50:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>. Landry uses the metaphor of a toaster to illustrate them [01:54:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>:
*   **Purpose:** Ascribed from the *outside* by an external agent (e.g., a toaster's purpose is to cook toast, or be a paperweight) [01:55:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>.
*   **Value:** Intrinsic worth, perceived from the *inside* (e.g., the value of the toaster's raw materials like iron and copper, or if it were made of solid gold) [01:56:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:11">[01:56:11]</a>.
*   **Meaning:** Relates to the *relationship* or dynamic between the inside and outside, not solely internal or external (e.g., using a toaster to make breakfast in bed for a loved one adds a romantic, relational meaning) [01:57:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:52">[01:57:52]</a>.

Meaningfulness is the underlying concept, grounding both value and purpose [01:51:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:26">[01:51:26]</a>.

### Self, Perception, and Expression

Landry's concept of [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self]] is not limited to humans; it applies to any conscious entity or "beingness" [01:19:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>, including aliens in other universes [01:19:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>. He posits that "choice has [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self]]" rather than the conventional "[[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self]] has choice," viewing [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self]] as an epiphenomenon of continuous choice [01:21:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>, [01:22:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>.

The relationship between [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self]] and world involves two directions of flow:
*   **Perception:** Flow from the world to the [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self]] [01:23:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. It is always private [01:24:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
*   **Expression:** Flow from the [[philosophical_perspectives_on_selfdeception | self]] to the world [01:23:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>. It is always public [01:23:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>.

Ethical responsibility lies solely with one's choices and expressions, not perceptions or knowing [01:24:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>. This means thought crime should not be considered unethical [01:26:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:19">[01:26:19]</a>.

### Want, Need, and Desire

Landry distinguishes between three concepts of human drives:
*   **Want:** Satisfied externally, requiring engagement with the outside world (e.g., a candy bar) [01:36:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.
*   **Need:** Satisfied internally through an internal process (e.g., the body's need for energy and growth from food) [01:36:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:28">[01:36:28]</a>.
*   **Desire:** Satisfaction occurs on the boundary, in relationship between internal and external (e.g., shared meaning in language) [01:37:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>.

Recognizing these distinctions helps in making effective choices and avoiding ineffective behaviors [01:38:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:10">[01:38:10]</a>.

## Ethical Communication Principles

Good communication, essential for ethical interaction, is facilitated when each participant grants the other three rights [01:26:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>:
1.  The right to speak [01:26:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:45">[01:26:45]</a>.
2.  The right to be understood [01:26:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46">[01:26:46]</a>.
3.  The right to know that one has been understood [01:26:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>.

These rights establish a protocol for "good communication" that enables error correction and trust in the communicative process [01:28:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This approach encourages cooperative engagement (mistake theory) rather than competitive interaction (conflict theory) [01:30:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

Landry cautions against relying solely on abstract intellectual considerations, such as "trolley problems," for ethical reasoning [01:39:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:11]</a>. True ethical practice requires engaging with both thought and feeling to make high-quality choices [01:40:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:15">[01:40:15]</a>.

With increasing technological capabilities, the relevance of ethical thinking and feeling has grown exponentially [01:41:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a>. Principles of ethics guide individuals and communities to be in "right relationship" with the natural world and each other [01:42:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>, becoming crucial for civilization design and global survival [01:42:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>, [01:43:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>.

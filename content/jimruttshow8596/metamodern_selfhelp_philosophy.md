Hanzi Freinacht, a philosopher and writer, has been a key developer of [[political_metamodernism | political metamodernism]] and [[metamodernism_as_a_philosophical_framework | metamodernism]] more broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. His work, including "The Listening Society" and "The Nordic Ideology," has significantly influenced the Game B community and the "liminal web of radical social changers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Freinacht's newest book, "12 Commandments for Extraordinary People to Master Ordinary Life," serves as a direct engagement with Jordan Peterson's self-help philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Metamodernism as a Response to Postmodernism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>

Freinacht's philosophical journey began in a "very [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy | postmodern]] setting" within a sociology department, where critical perspectives on power, language, and the social construction of reality were prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. While appreciating the moral sensibilities and critical elements of [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy | postmodernism]], he sought to move beyond mere critique to "construct something" new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This led him to Integral Theory and developmental psychology, which offered crucial pieces to the puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The term [[metamodernism_as_a_philosophical_framework | metamodernism]], emerging from cultural theorists analyzing contemporary arts and pop culture, resonated as a concept for what comes after [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy | postmodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

His goal became to integrate the cultural analysis of [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy | postmodernism]] with developmental and [[relevance_of_spirituality_and_altered_states_in_metamodernism | spiritual perspectives]] to construct visions for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This perspective views societal progress as inherently tied to supporting "the inner growth of human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The aim is to optimize for this growth in individuals, relationships, goals, and institutions, moving beyond the deconstruction of [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy | postmodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Freinacht sees Jordan Peterson's work as a "reactionary response" to [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy | postmodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. While Peterson's critique of [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy | postmodernism]] might be timely and useful, his underlying [[political_metamodernism | political philosophy]] is often characterized by classical liberalism and conservatism, representing a "step back" to modern values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Freinacht argues that Peterson's approach, while popular, didn't bring with it the "moral sensibilities of [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy | postmodernism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, leading to a "regression backwards" to a time (e.g., 1965) that, while feeling safe compared to "cultural nihilism," was marked by societal subordination and inequities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. In contrast, Freinacht's metamodern self-help aims to integrate the useful aspects of both [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy | modernism]] and [[postmodern_perspectives_in_philosophy | postmodernism]] to "step to the next level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

## Core Principles of Metamodern Self-Help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>

Freinacht's book, "12 Commandments for Extraordinary People to Master Ordinary Life," is designed as a "handbook for sanity" for those in communities like Game B, who possess "mad potentials" and intellectual/spiritual dynamism but often struggle with relationship breakdowns and personal "crashing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. He seeks an "embodied life philosophy" that is congruent with radical thinking, fostering "sober radical people" or "sober crazy people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

### Addressing the Meaning Crisis: Magic, Reductionism, and Oscillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>

Freinacht, aligning with "radical enlightenmentism," posits a world devoid of "magic" in the sense of anything breaking physics laws or involving unaccounted causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This stance addresses the "meaning crisis" that arises from relinquishing "two-world thinking" and the supernatural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Paradoxically, "magical thinking" often appears more frequently in highly developed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. This is because human development is not unidimensional; a richer "phenomenology" (first-person experience) can lead to a sense of "enchantment of reality" that outpaces cognitive capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. This "gap" between rational and spiritual capacities is often filled with magical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Conversely, if one's mind can explain more than their phenomenology senses, the world can feel like "dead matter" or mundane, leading to [[reductionism_vs_holism_in_modernity | reductionism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

The solution lies in a metamodern approach: learning to oscillate between opposing polarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. This involves oscillating between scientific skepticism (irony) and spiritual experience/magical belief (sincerity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Initially difficult, the skill of oscillating improves, eventually leading to a "superposition" where both seemingly contradictory stances are simultaneously true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. From this vantage point, ruthless scientific scrutiny allows for safer exploration of the magical realm and spiritual experience, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This approach aims to transcend the traditional divide between science and [[relevance_of_spirituality_and_altered_states_in_metamodernism | spirituality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.

### States and Happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>

A central concept in Freinacht's work is "state," referring to "first-person reality" or phenomenology – how reality appears and feels from one's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. States can range from "incomprehensibly dark hell" to "higher states" where one feels part of a "huge cosmic expanse" and connected to love and beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

He identifies "State Seven" as the default for many in modern life: "okay, sort of," marked by a "little tension," "worry," or "uneasiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. "State Eight," in contrast, is "genuinely okay," with a sense of safety, freshness, and being "at home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. Freinacht suggests that pre-civilized societies might have more readily experienced State Eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. The book posits that people can and should "strive for State Eight," as the increasing complexity and pressures of modern life will likely lead to a general decline in subjective states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Becoming "masters of our own subjective states" enhances social resilience, productivity, and reduces the likelihood of overreacting or succumbing to "crazy schemes" like conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.

## The 12 Commandments: Selected Principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>

The book's "12 Commandments" offer a path to mastering ordinary life with a metamodern sensibility:

### 1. Live in a Mess, Moderately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>
This commandment directly challenges Peterson's "clean up your room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. Freinacht argues that one doesn't need "a life in perfect order to valuably partake in society and work for its improvements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. While Peterson addresses "social reductionism" (reducing individual issues to societal ones), Freinacht highlights "individualist [[reductionism_vs_holism_in_modernity | reductionism]]" (turning social issues into individual responsibilities, e.g., blaming an individual for Jim Crow laws) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. The point is to acknowledge both individual responsibility and societal structures without one reducing the other.

### 2. Fornicate Like a Beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>
This provocative title refers to "cosmo-eroticism" – fostering a love for reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. To achieve this, individuals must "reconnect to and through our bodies" as "animal creatures," overcoming inhibitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>. This isn't about a libertine lifestyle but about addressing "traumas and these blockages" of the emotional body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. By feeling emotions honestly and going "through the pain" (e.g., resolving troubles), one can unlock their "sense of aliveness," leading to higher subjective states and greater freedom in thought, action, and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

### 3. Live Sincerely, Ironically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>
This encapsulates the metamodern oscillation between skepticism (irony) and authentic engagement (sincerity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. Irony involves holding realities as hypothetical, allowing for perspective shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. However, pure irony leads to nihilism, with "nothing to live for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>. True sincerity requires an ironic stance towards oneself – checking facts, acknowledging potential wrongness, and accepting that one, like all others throughout history, will likely be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. "Ironic sincerity is just real sincerity, and sincerity without irony is just not real sincerity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>. This allows for greater authenticity and boldness, as one is less defensive when their stance is robustly thought through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

### 5. Quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>
Quitting is often demonized but is foundational to freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. A slave, by definition, cannot quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. Knowing one *can* quit (jobs, habits, even relationships) means that chosen engagements are truly chosen, leading to greater energy application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>. Quitting is a skill that takes courage, and practicing it with "little things" builds the capacity to navigate larger life changes, freeing up time and energy for more optimized pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.

### 6. Do the Walk of Shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>
This refers to a personal "walk through your own gallery of shameful memories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. Shame, more than fear or guilt, is a powerful inhibitory emotion that "locks you down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>. By taking an inventory of these memories and "feeling through the shame" until it leaves the body, individuals can address these "shame buttons" that otherwise remain activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>. This process of revisiting and re-evaluating shameful experiences (some of which may have been based on idiotic societal conventions) allows for greater freedom and healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>. The chapter also addresses guilt, which requires deeper introspection due to mental obfuscations and excuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

### 7. Sacrifice Immortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:0:54">[01:0:54]</a>
This commandment tackles the fear of death, which Freinacht argues is "rather inescapable" and deeply rooted, even if one intellectually dismisses it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. It links to historical stages of human development, where traditional religions universally introduced concepts of hell and eternal damnation tied to guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>. The command also touches on the "slave morality" or "fear of envy"—the tendency to be ashamed of one's strengths, virtues, and talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. To fully embrace one's potential, these self-imposed inhibitions must be overcome. The concept of "reverse death therapy" suggests mentally "scaling away" successes and positive attributes to see what remains of oneself, fostering resilience and detachment from external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.

### 8. Heal with Justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a>
This commandment marks the "top of the arc" of the book, linking personal healing to social justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>. Once personal issues like shame, guilt, and fear are addressed, one can become a "Righteous Rebel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. Justice, in this context, means "wholeness" or bringing "social relations" into "proportion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>. When social relationships are asymmetrical or based on false premises, they cause hurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. Healing involves aligning words, actions, perceptions, and emotions within oneself and in transpersonal space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>. Fighting for justice is about healing the world by addressing these "disalignments" and "cracks in social reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>. This leads to congruence and inner peace, as personal integrity reinforces outward action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>. It advocates for "non-hypocritical social justice" that stems from genuine care and a search for truth, rather than resentment or self-aggrandizement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. A useful "tell" for potential injustice is the excessive use of adjectives in language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>.

### 9. Burn Your Maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:39">[01:28:39]</a>
"Maps" represent one's fundamental worldview or cognitive schema <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>. Individuals often operate with "very, very, very limited Maps" but tend to believe their map is the best possible one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:54">[01:30:54]</a>. Burning one's map means actively challenging and discarding existing worldviews to discover new ones, even if it means risking one's life story being built on an incorrect foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>. This requires inner spaciousness and peace, enabling one to hold their map "less hysterically" and imagine "other possible worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>. It's a continuous process of self-improvement and intellectual humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:28">[01:33:28]</a>.

### 11. Kill Your Guru and Find Your Others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:29">[01:36:29]</a>
This commandment critiques the "guru game" – following individuals who claim secret knowledge or exert undue influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>. Excessive devotion to a single figure, like the "sheer amount of hours" people spend listening to Jordan Peterson, can indicate a "guru enthralled" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:40">[01:37:40]</a>. Instead of following a guru, it's more beneficial to "triangulate different perspectives" and "burn your maps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:11">[01:38:11]</a>. Guru-following can be a form of "pseudo participation," where one projects their own "unique gift" or vision onto another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>. This is an "adult version of believing in Santa Claus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.

Instead of gurus, the path lies in finding "really loyal friends" who are "on the same wavelength" and can engage laterally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:08">[01:42:08]</a>. While gurus "sell themselves," friends must be "created" and their relationships maintained through understanding strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:16">[01:42:16]</a>. This leads to exponential power and productivity through collective skill sets, a core principle in Game B's "find the others" and "coherence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>.

### 12. Play for Forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:45">[01:43:45]</a>
This final commandment suggests that the "end of the story of any good story is at a happy point," and this happiness often involves conclusion and wholeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:33">[01:44:33]</a>. "Play for forgiveness" doesn't mean immediate, unconditional forgiveness, especially in ongoing oppressive situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:41">[01:45:41]</a>. Instead, it's a strategic direction, recognizing that an "accomplished life is a life through the living of which we forgive the world for not being perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:34">[01:46:34]</a>.

This involves forgiving oneself, specific situations, honest mistakes, and eventually, even intentional malice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:25">[01:49:25]</a>. Ultimately, the goal is to reach a point where "there is nothing to forgive," seeing a "primordial wholeness" where events simply play out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>. This "reverse Christianity" (forgiving God/reality, rather than seeking God's forgiveness) helps liberate the soul from resentment, fostering "peace of mind" and allowing actions to stem from "care and love or search for truth" rather than bitterness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>. By playing for forgiveness, one "comes home to this world" and truly lives their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:09">[01:51:09]</a>.

The encounter between humanity and advanced [[ai_and_human_coexistence | AI]] prompts a critical discussion on how society should manage this relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. A prevalent false dichotomy exists, suggesting that institutional structures for managing humanity's relationship with [[ai_and_human_coexistence | AI]] must be either market-driven or state-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:45">[01:42:45]</a>. However, this perspective overlooks a fundamental third mode: the commons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:05">[02:11:05]</a>.

## The Commons as a Fundamental Mode
The commons is presented as a fundamental and proper location for governing [[ai_and_human_coexistence | AI]] or humanity's relationship with [[ai_and_human_coexistence | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>. Historically, the concept of the commons dates back to the dawn of humanity, where the natural world and early communal spaces like campfires were managed collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:07">[03:55:07]</a>. Its significance began to shrink with settled agriculture, the rise of the state, and later, phenomena like the enclosures in Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:07">[04:09:07]</a>.

The modern understanding of the "commons" often represents a remnant or "leftover" from a time when nature was the base state, and humans lived within natural structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:07">[05:13:07]</a>. As civilization became the dominant context, nature was increasingly viewed as a special case within the civilizational layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:07">[06:00:07]</a>.

### The Church as a Deeper Category of the Commons
A deeper category of the commons is identified as the "church" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>. The term "church" (from Greek *Ecclesia*) refers to a group of people who come together and enter into "communion," a process that brings a soul into a group, enabling it to become a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:07">[09:57:07]</a>. This contrasts with "society," which is described as a degenerate, parasitic collapse of community that has lost its soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:07">[08:44:07]</a>.

The church, in this context, is the body of the soul of a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:07">[10:16:07]</a>. It signifies cultural and [[spiritual_and_ethical_considerations_in_ai_development | spiritual practices]] that inform the communion grounding a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:07">[10:55:07]</a>. This concept extends beyond Abrahamic traditions to include communities organized around various "organizing principles" or "principalities," such as the Athenians bound by the spirit of Athena or a Tibetan village by Tibetan Buddhism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:07">[11:51:07]</a>. These principles are seen as non-physical but real supervenient constraints that govern and organize a collection of individuals into a coherent whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:07">[20:53:07]</a>.

## AI Alignment and the Soul
The concept of [[the_ethical_implications_of_ai_development | AI alignment]] is central to this discussion. It is asserted that [[the_ethical_implications_of_ai_development | AI]] cannot be aligned with "humanity" as an abstraction because "humanity" as a concept has no soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:07">[03:22:07]</a>. However, alignment is possible with given individuals who do possess souls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:07">[03:38:07]</a>.

An individual's soul is defined in an Aristotelian sense as the organizing principle of the entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:07">[07:40:07]</a>. While society might have homeostatic loops, only a community, a group of human beings who have come together in a soulful fashion, can truly be aligned with [[ai_and_human_coexistence | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:07">[08:35:07]</a>. Current efforts to align [[the_ethical_implications_of_ai_development | AI]] with society by "algorithmic processes" are a "category error" and will fail, as society itself is not aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:07">[33:42:07]</a>.

### The Principalities Governing Society
Modern society is largely driven by "principalities" such as Mammon (disconnected market/capitalism) and Moloch (disconnected state/socialism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:07">[39:39:07]</a>. These "idols" are worshipped for their own sake when disconnected from a broader set of core principles that ground and orient them into a well-integrated whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:23:07">[41:23:07]</a>. The prevailing societal engine, characterized by the "relentless algorithmic search for medium-term money on money return," guides the encounter with [[ai_and_human_coexistence | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:11:07">[39:11:07]</a>. This results in [[ai_as_a_selfleveraging_accelerator_posing_existential_risks | AI]] accelerating this societal "game A" towards a cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:56:07">[37:56:07]</a>.

## AI as a Self-Leveraging Accelerator
[[AI as a selfleveraging accelerator posing existential risks | AI]] is distinguished from other [[emergent_risks_of_ai_and_societal_impacts | catastrophic risks]] (like nukes or Crispr) by its nature as a "self-leveraging accelerator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:07">[35:35:07]</a>. Unlike static outputs such as forever chemicals, [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] becomes an input, producing a recursive feedback loop that rapidly increases its capabilities and societal output capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:48:07">[35:48:07]</a>. This phenomenon, often referred to as the Singularity, means that even if [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] isn't self-feedbacking, its integration into a larger collective intelligence system, fueled by market incentives, leads to exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:25:07">[37:25:07]</a>.

If managed solely by the state and market, the encounter between humanity and [[ai_and_human_coexistence | AI]] is predicted to lead to:
*   **Hyper-concentration of power:** Power will concentrate in entities closest to the accelerating feedback loop of intelligence, leading to an evaporation of power further from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:06:07">[45:06:07]</a>. This could result in a "neo-feudalism," where those with access to 100x [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] tools dominate, while others are marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:57:07">[46:57:07]</a>. Unlike traditional feudalism, this lacks a moral framework, purely driven by [[artificial_intelligence_and_philosophy | game theory]] dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:02:07">[48:02:07]</a>.
*   **Dispensing with values:** All values downstream of the core worship of intelligence and power will be increasingly ignored in the relentless competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:17:07">[46:17:07]</a>.
*   **Entropy:** Ultimately, this path leads to societal entropy, a "drift" from rich, well-integrated community life (like a local coffee shop) to a soulless, disconnected simulacrum (like a Starbucks in Manhattan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:07">[53:30:07]</a>. This is effectively the entropy of culture or community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:31:07">[54:31:07]</a>.

## The Alternative Path: Personal/Intimate AI and the Re-emergence of the Commons
An alternative path involves awakening to the reality of the commons (or church) as the proper domain for managing [[ai_and_human_coexistence | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:29:07">[55:29:07]</a>. This requires engaging in cultural and [[spiritual_and_ethical_considerations_in_ai_development | spiritual practices]] that foster communion and integrate multiplicity into a coherent whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:07">[55:50:07]</a>. It demands a level of "seriousness" where questions of life and death live, unlike the market or state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:09:07">[58:09:07]</a>. It also implies the emergence of a "proper Priestly class" â€“ individuals uniquely focused on critical questions and capable of supporting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:16:07">[59:16:07]</a>.

### Personal/Intimate AI
The concept of [[decentralized_governance_and_its_impact_on_ai_development | decentralized AI]] or "intimate [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]]" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Feasibility:** The decreasing cost of compute and rapid propagation of [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] innovations make it economically practical to produce perfectly personal [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] that is physically controlled by the individual and biometrically bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.
*   **Superiority of Intimate AI:** Intimate [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]], trained on highly specific and personal data, is hypothesized to be more functional and effective than generalized [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>. This creates a different topology, acting as a "fortress" against the risks of the infosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.
*   **The Wisdom Coach:** For intimate [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] to align with a human, the human must first be aligned and coherent with themselves, possessing clarity on their values and living with integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>. The intimate [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] would serve as a "wisdom coach," aiding individuals in recovering and aligning their souls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>. This support allows the [[Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy | AI]] to be governed by the individual's soul, representing what "church" looks like at the individual level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.
*   **Network Effects:** These individual intimate AIs would naturally connect and collaborate, forming a reinforcing meta-network based on shared ethical values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>. This distributed network provides an alternative path to the concentrated power structures of the oligarchy or techno-imperialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

The ability for this model to propagate rapidly exists due to the mobilizing capacity of the global economy and infosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:58">[01:09:58]</a>. The ultimate question is whether people will choose to act on what is good, true, and beautiful, rather than expediency, strategy, power, and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. This is fundamentally a [[spiritual_and_ethical_considerations_in_ai_development | spiritual question]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>. It emphasizes the need for talented individuals to abandon their capture by Mammon and Moloch and organize into ethical communities driven by higher values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

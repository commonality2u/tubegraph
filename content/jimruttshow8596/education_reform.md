Zach Stein, a writer, educator, and futurist, focuses on bringing a greater sense of sanity and justice to education, especially as it relates to the global [[metacrisis_and_education | meta-crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. His work is primarily explored in his book, "Education in a Time Between Worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Education in a Time Between Worlds

The concept of "a time between worlds" is drawn from Immanuel Wallerstein's world Systems Theory, which describes periods of economic rollovers where a dominant force decays, leading to a lack of clear overarching order until a new one emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. These periods align with models of cultural evolution, marking transitions between historical epochs (e.g., late pre-modern to early modern, mature modern to postmodern) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Currently, humanity is in such a period of transition, moving to a different world while still on the same Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. In these times, [[education_vs_propaganda | education]] becomes a primary vector for establishing the new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This perspective informs the need for a "hard reboot" of basic human structures, which links to concepts like Game B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## The Global Meta-crisis and Education

Stein posits that [[metacrisis_and_education | education]] is a central aspect of the global [[metacrisis_and_education | meta-crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The [[metacrisis_and_education | meta-crisis]] can be understood as a superordinate crisis arising from the combination of many individual crises (ecological, geopolitical, local political, schools, healthcare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. It is fundamentally an educational crisis, akin to being lost in the woods and lacking the skills and mental fortitude to navigate the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

This [[metacrisis_and_education | meta-crisis]] manifests in several ways within education:
*   **Capabilities Crisis**: A mismatch between exponentially rising complexity in the world and a lagging increase in human capacity to meet these problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Civilization's problems have become too complex too quickly, leading to a lag in the human capacity upgrade needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Legitimation Crisis**: A difficulty in determining who holds legitimate authority, leading to a lack of social cohesion and capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This has been present in schools and universities for a while, contributing to a widespread sense of illegitimacy across major institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Meaning Crisis**: A cultural incoherence where people lack a sense of purpose as a species, nation, or individual, questioning the meaning of suffering, joy, death, sleep, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This vacuum is often filled by conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Intelligibility/Sense-making Crisis**: A struggle to cognitively make sense of the world, distinct from a capability crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

These crises are not infrastructure failures or political breakdowns, but rather "interior" problems residing within the human psyche and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. They are issues of consciousness, learning, human development, and [[education_vs_propaganda | education]] that require a different approach than technical solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Despite the primacy of education, it has been marginalized and neglected, and is now "preyed upon by forces seeking to profit from the obvious crisis of capability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, such as predatory student loan lending and the push to privatize schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This poor management since roughly 1972 has led to a potential catastrophic breakdown of [[intergenerational_transmission_in_education | intergenerational transmission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Reductive Human Capital Theory

A significant impediment to genuine [[education_vs_propaganda | education]] is the "reductive human capital theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This theory views human beings as a form of capital or commodity, where skills residing within individuals are seen as capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The educational system, in this view, becomes a sub-component of the broader economy, tasked with supplying human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This approach reduces the multifaceted dimensions of [[intergenerational_transmission_in_education | intergenerational transmission]] to solely the reproduction of the economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

Stein argues that this theory is a "self-terminating protocol" for an educational system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. It undermines the "hidden curriculum" of culture, which includes the uncompensated labor of human development (often performed by mothers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. By over-focusing on economic efficiency, it ultimately destroys intangibles like motivation, creative thinking, and ethical compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Examples include "No Child Left Behind" and "Obama's Race to the Top," which are dominated by this human capital mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This approach treats education as a commodity exchange, prioritizing return on investment over genuine learning and ethical development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

Instead of blaming schools or parents, the focus should be on the surrounding institutions and systems that make it nearly impossible to "do the right thing" within these spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. True [[education_vs_propaganda | education reform]] requires broader [[revitalizing_cultural_and_democratic_institutions | societal reform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Ideas for good policing or education cannot work in the current "hyper financialized ratchet of status as consumerism" (Game A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. The inability to have ethical institutions work points to fundamental flaws in society itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

## The Breakdown of Intergenerational Transmission

The current situation is characterized by a "catastrophic breakdown" of [[intergenerational_transmission_in_education | intergenerational transmission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. This failure is a result of the "colonization of the life world" by commercial and strategic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. The distance between elders and youth has grown so significant that it risks becoming "generational warfare," with current asset holding and access to power largely hoarded by older generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

The information ecology, dominated by platforms like Facebook and Google, has become a major factor in shaping people's capacities and epistemic frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. While these technologies offer amazing informational resources (e.g., Google Scholar, Khan Academy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>, informational environments are not necessarily educational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. Social media, in particular, is designed to be addictive and is used for micro-targeted advertisements, harvesting attention and capability for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. This impacts the least well-off, who may lack the self-direction or discipline to navigate these environments educationally, leading to depression, addiction, and susceptibility to conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.

## Re-establishing Teacherly Authority

A central theme for [[education_vs_propaganda | education reform]] is the importance of re-establishing "teacherly authority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. This is seen as the root of resolving the educational and, by extension, the [[metacrisis_and_education | meta-crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>.

### Nature of Teacherly Authority
Teacherly authority is a species-specific human trait, essential for human culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. It's a deep-seated archetype of teaching and learning, facilitated by "joint attentional awareness"â€”an interaction where a knowledgeable person (teacher) engages with a less knowledgeable person (student) with the shared intention of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>. This involves an asymmetry of knowledge and capacity, often with a power asymmetry, but crucially, the teacher acts in the best interests of the learner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. It relies on the perceived legitimacy of the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.

Teacherly authority is not limited to formal schooling; it occurs in diverse contexts, such as an auto mechanic explaining car problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. It's a dynamic, flexible, and shifting structure where competence and skill spontaneously create hierarchies in productive working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

### Undermining Teacherly Authority
Current systems have undermined legitimate teacherly authority:
*   **Bureaucratic Power**: When teacherly authority is based solely on bureaucratic power rather than actual knowledge asymmetry, it becomes "pseudo teacherly authority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.
*   **Digital Information Ecology**: The rise of digital platforms where authority is based on popularity, likes, or celebrity status muddies the water, making it difficult to detect legitimate teacherly authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>. This "water has become so muddy" that when true authority appears, there's often a knee-jerk reaction to reject it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.
*   **Commodity Exchange**: When education is framed as a commodity, students act as consumers who are "always right," disrupting the student's role as a learner who needs to be challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.
*   **Standardized Testing**: Standardized tests mandate specific content and assessment types, forcing teachers to prioritize test performance over authentic learning, thereby undermining genuine teacherly authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.

### The Role of Parenting
Parenting is intimately linked to teacherly authority and [[intergenerational_transmission_in_education | intergenerational transmission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. The breakdown of family structures is not merely a moral failing of individuals but a "moral failing at the level of the society," which allows for conditions like inequitable distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>. Attempting to micromanage familial life through social workers or parenting licenses (e.g., paying mothers to raise children) would be an "Orwellian shitshow" that devastates the [[intergenerational_transmission_in_education | intergenerational transmission]] of love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. Families are preyed upon and used to "offload externalities" of the current social system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>.

### Towards a New Model
Stein advocates for a "nuanced and distributed and non-dogmatic form of teacherly authority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. This would involve dismantling traditional schools and creating an "educational hub network" where distributed teacherly authority flourishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. This requires contexts where younger and older people engage with actual meaningful problems together, moving away from "busywork" towards apprentice-like relationships in "neo-guild like structures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. Such spontaneous contexts allow legitimate teacherly authority to arise, whereas traditional schooling often disincentivizes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

## Pharmacologicalization of K-12 Education

A controversial symptom of the educational crisis is the "pharmacologicalization" and medicalization of K-12 [[education_vs_propaganda | education]], particularly the proliferation of ADHD diagnoses and psychotropic drug prescriptions for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>.

This represents the "medicalization of academic underperformance," which turns the dynamic of teacherly authority into a strategic one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>. Instead of "raising children" into their unique selves through collaborative, non-strategic interaction where interests align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>, this approach constitutes "designing children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:28">[01:32:28]</a>. It involves unilateral, strategic intervention into the biological substrate of the child to perpetuate the older generation's view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>.

Reframing academic struggles as medical problems shifts the locus of intervention from cultural and interpersonal dynamics (teacherly authority) to biomechanical intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:15">[01:35:15]</a>. This leads children to believe their nervous systems are "broken" or genetically disadvantaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:37">[01:38:37]</a>. This trend is part of a broader "depoliticization of deviance" and medicalization of any view or lifestyle that is disagreed with or not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>.

The disproportionate impact on boys (e.g., 15% on ADHD medication vs. 2% of girls, though girls are often prescribed different meds for anxiety/depression) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a>, along with the "utopia of rules" (Graeber's concept of excessive bureaucracy and zero tolerance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:29">[01:43:29]</a> and reduced recess time, is seen as systematically disadvantaging normal boyhood development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:10">[01:45:10]</a>. Reducing unsupervised play limits children's ability to creatively resolve interpersonal problems and develop autonomous moral reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:12">[01:46:12]</a>. This controlling approach stems from a neurotic desire to control every aspect of a child's life, preventing them from becoming sovereign agents and instead designing them to perpetuate an economic system that disadvantages them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:46">[01:48:46]</a>.

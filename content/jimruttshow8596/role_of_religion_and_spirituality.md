Jordan Hall asserts that if the Christian Trinity is understood correctly, the Christian God becomes logically necessary for any possible world, including the Multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:01">[02:35:01]</a>. This assertion forms the core of a discussion on [[philosophical_ideas_around_sacredness_and_spirituality | philosophical ideas around sacredness and spirituality]] and the nature of reality.

## The Christian Trinity as Logically Necessary

The argument for the logical necessity of the Christian God, specifically the Trinity, is structured in three parts:
1.  **Ontological Primacy**: A triadic structure, which is fundamentally relational, serves as the ontological primitive or "bootloader" for all conceptual and ontological characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:01">[07:45:01]</a>.
2.  **Specific Triadic Structure**: The Christian Trinity is identified as this particular necessary triadic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:01">[09:06:01]</a>.
3.  **Nature of Belief**: Belief is understood as an existential commitment rather than a strictly mental operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:01">[09:51:01]</a>.

### Relational Ontology vs. Substance Ontology

The discussion delves into the concept of relational ontology, where relationship is considered the ontological primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:01">[23:19:01]</a>.
*   **Relational Primacy**: Relationship, as a concept and an ontology, implicitly and necessarily contains the relata (the things in relationship) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:01">[25:15:01]</a>.
*   **Critique of Materialism**: The notion of an object existing absent relationship is deemed plausible only within a substance ontology, which is seen as leading to materialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:01">[26:49:01]</a>. Materialism, in this view, arises from an implicit supposition that an object qua object is a valid thing in itself, allowing for decontextualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:01">[27:36:01]</a>.
*   **Reality as Relationship**: Reality itself is found in the relationship between subject and object, not strictly mapped to the object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:01">[14:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:01">[29:00:01]</a>. The most real is relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:01">[29:15:01]</a>.
*   **Counter-argument**: Jim Rut maintains that substance and relationship must coexist and neither can be prior to the other, citing thinkers like Russell, Whitehead, and Heidegger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:01">[35:50:01]</a>. The universe we are "thrown into" involves the co-creation of these two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:09:01">[36:09:01]</a>.

### Philosophical Concepts and the Trinity

Fundamental concepts are arranged in a hierarchical stack, where deeper concepts necessarily imply shallower ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:01">[12:07:01]</a>.
*   **Core Concepts**: Concepts like unity, multiplicity, sameness, distinction, being, and becoming are considered fundamental, more so than space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:01">[15:54:01]</a>. These basic concepts form a "minimum compact set" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:01">[37:17:01]</a>.
*   **Trinity as a Mapping**: The Christian Trinity aligns with this minimum compact set:
    *   **Unity**: The "godhead" or wholeness of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:01">[37:45:01]</a>.
    *   **Multiplicity**: The three persons (hypostases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:01">[37:53:01]</a>.
    *   **Relationality**: The intrinsic relationship between and among the persons, where their shared relationship is the Oneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:01">[38:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:01">[39:57:01]</a>.
*   **Analogy to Marriage**: A three-person marriage can serve as an example, where the marriage itself is the unity, the people are the multiplicity, and the complex relationships define the relationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:01">[41:15:01]</a>. The "body of the marriage" is purely relationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:01">[42:47:01]</a>.
*   **Trinity as a Platonic Form**: The Trinity is presented as the platonic form of this unity-multiplicity-relationality characteristic that appears throughout reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:01">[43:55:01]</a>. Instances of this structure in the world "participate in" or are "instances of" the more basic structure of the Trinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:22:01">[44:22:01]</a>.
*   **Dehumanizing the Persons**: The "persons" of the Trinity are not literal human-like figures but rather fundamental aspects of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:56:01">[48:56:01]</a>.
    *   **Second Person (Logos)**: All forms of logos (narrative, incarnation) participate in and embody the second person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16:01">[46:16:01]</a>. This includes the natural laws and settings of the universe that enable complex emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:46:01">[55:46:01]</a>.
    *   **First Person (Father)**: The essence of the Father is found in the relationship between the Son and the Spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. It embodies the characteristic of "begottenness" (lineage, distinction with continuity) and "proceeds" (discontinuity or symmetry, holding things together without singular identity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. This sets transcendent constraints that enable certain things to happen within the domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>.
    *   **Third Person (Spirit)**: The Spirit is the relationship of the Father and the Son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. It enables both distinction and unity, showing how multiplicity and wholeness are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

## The Nature of Faith (Pistis)

The concept of belief needs to be distinguished from [[role_of_religion_in_politics | ideology]].
*   **Belief as Existential Commitment**: "Belief" (Greek: *pistis*, translated as "faith") is defined as an existential commitment or a way of life, not a strictly mental operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. It is distinct from nominal belief, which is merely a fixation on a particular set of words or doctrines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>.
*   **Plato's Influence**: In Plato's work, *pistis* refers to embodied, deeply intimate relationship with a domain of reality gained through engaged experience or mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:18">[01:36:18]</a>. This is distinct from *doxa* (opinion/nonsensical stories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:55">[01:35:55]</a> and *episteme* (perceiving underlying principles/intellectual understanding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.
*   **Faith as Livingness**: For Paul in the New Testament, *pistis* means "livingness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>. It is the cultivation of a capacity for a well-honed, harmonious, rich, nuanced, subtle, and intimate relationship with reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:59">[01:38:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>.
*   **Living with Faith**: One can live with *faith* (existential commitment) even while explicitly rejecting the *ideology* or *nominal belief* in the Trinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:45">[01:34:45]</a>. The ability to navigate life well, take risks, and act with confidence is built on this kind of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:44">[01:39:44]</a>.

### Religion as Ideology vs. Christianity as Faith

*   **Critique of "Religion"**: Much of what is commonly called "[[role_of_religion_in_politics | religion]]" is seen as either *doxa* (opinion/stories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:59">[01:36:59]</a> or a mechanism of control, invented or evolved for societal influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>.
*   **Meaning of "Religio"**: The word "religio" (Latin) means "binding together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:45">[01:40:45]</a>. It implies constructing scaffolding or artificial institutions to cope with being separated from the wholeness of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:56">[01:40:56]</a>.
*   **Christianity's Invitation**: Christianity, when understood as becoming Disciples of Christ, invites one to enter into full, rich, nuanced, complete, embodied faith-relationship with the actual whole of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:01">[01:44:01]</a>. It is a "personal God," meaning it calls for a personal relationship with reality, not just an intellectual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a>. This echoes John Vervaeke's "[[the_relationship_between_intelligence_spirituality_and_religion | religion that's not a religion]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>.
*   **Beyond Ideology**: The Trinity, properly understood, cannot be an ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:41">[01:49:41]</a>. It is intrinsically mysterious and beyond human capacity to grasp epistemologically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:22">[01:50:22]</a>.

## Science, Physics, and the Logos

The universe's unfolding, described through physics and emergent complexity, aligns with the theological concepts of the Trinity.
*   **Physics as Logos**: The universe's origin, lawfulness, and unfolding are congruent with the physics story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. The "logos" (second person of the Trinity) is identified with the universe, or "creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:47:01">[54:47:01]</a>.
*   **Constraints and Emergence**: The universe's natural laws act as transcendent constraints, enabling and disabling certain outcomes, leading to increased complexity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:46:01">[55:46:01]</a>. This process of emergence, where new levels of reality arise without violating lower-level laws, is seen as an aspect of the logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.
*   **Science's Limits**: Science, reliant on experimentation and observation of found data, cannot explain *why* the laws of physics are as they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. This question falls into a more fundamental domain containing both logic and physics, which is the proper place for theology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>.
*   **Theology as the Discipline of Reality**: Theology is framed as "the discipline of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>, operating at a level more fundamental than physics or logic, explaining the underlying components necessary for a "world" to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

## Biblical Literalism and Understanding Scripture

Biblical literalism is critically examined in favor of a deeper understanding of scripture.
*   **Literalism's Origin**: Biblical literalism is a relatively recent movement, emerging in the 19th century in American theological seminaries as a reaction to European biblical criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>. It aimed to provide "fundamentals" as a harbor against perceived "degeneracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>.
*   **Scripture Beyond Journalism**: Literalism erroneously presupposes that scripture should be understood like journalism or science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:52">[01:58:52]</a>. However, scripture is "radically deeper" than journalism, history, or even science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:12">[01:59:12]</a>.
*   **Scripture as Good Fiction**: Scripture is likened to "good fiction" or "great literature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>. While not literally true in a journalistic sense, it conveys "vastly more truth" about human existence and deeper patterns of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:56">[02:01:56]</a>. This truth is accessible across diverse cultures and enables people to order their lives based on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:02">[02:03:02]</a>.
*   **Critique of Academic Biblical Criticism**: Academic biblical criticism is often seen as mediocre, subject to academic fashions and power structures, and failing to grasp the deeper truths conveyed by scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:25">[02:04:25]</a>.
*   **Historicity of Christ**: The historicity of Christ is considered a binding point in reality that, along with the philosophical understanding of the Trinity, "unlocks another piece" of the Trinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:54">[02:06:54]</a>. The logical necessity of the Trinity is a stronger claim than historical reality, though the logical necessity of the Incarnation and Resurrection is also proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:45">[02:07:45]</a>.

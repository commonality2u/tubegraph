The Omega Principle, an idea significantly developed by Brett Weinstein, posits a fundamental and necessary relationship between genes and [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>. This principle expands on the concept of epigenetics, which literally means "above the genome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>.

## Epigenetics and Culture

While epigenetics in the modern era typically refers to molecular regulators of the genome (sensu stricto), the broader interpretation (sensu lato) includes any factors above the gene layer that can modulate gene expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>. [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | Culture]] is considered one of these significant epigenetic regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.

### The Role of Culture

[[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | Culture]] is deemed "superior" to genes in its flexibility and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. Cultural change can occur within generations, unlike genetic changes which are fixed at the point of zygote formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>. Despite its faster evolution and more labile nature, [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | culture]] inherently serves the genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.

The Omega Principle uses "omega" to represent this obligate relationship, similar to how pi invokes the relationship between a circle's diameter and circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. Thus, [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | culture]] is as much a part of [[Evolutionary and cultural dynamics | evolutionary dynamics]] as genes are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>. A cultural element is considered evolutionary and ultimately serving genetic interests if it has:
*   Persisted over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>
*   Stood the test of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>
*   Complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>
*   Variable extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>

## Addressing Maladaptive Cultural Traits

A significant challenge to the Omega Principle arises when considering negative cultural adaptations like war, slavery, and rape, which have been ubiquitous throughout human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. By the Omega Principle, these practices must have been adaptive at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.

However, the fact that something was adaptive does not mean it is good, honorable, or immutable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>. This highlights the [[impact of human nature and cultural practices on societal design | naturalistic fallacy]] â€“ the idea that "what is" does not dictate "what ought to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>.

There is "tremendous plasticity" in human behavior and even in the human phenotype, such as variations in the aortic arch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>. This biological flexibility suggests that humans are not fated by their [[Evolutionary and cultural dynamics | evolutionary history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:36">[01:21:36]</a>.

The hopeful message of [[Evolutionary and cultural dynamics | evolutionary biology]], and the book *A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century*, is that understanding our evolutionary past enables us to change for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. Humans can and should take ownership of their [[Culture and Its Role in Human Development | culture]], moving from a "backward-looking compiler" of past learnings to a proactive, forward-looking form that adapts to a hyper-novel world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>. This involves understanding our capabilities and navigating challenges like population growth, climate change, and societal instability with increased awareness and intentionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>.

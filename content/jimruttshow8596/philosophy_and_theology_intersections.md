This article explores the intersections of philosophy and theology, particularly focusing on the Christian Trinity, [[relational_ontology_and_the_christian_trinity | relational ontology]], and the nature of belief. The discussion features Jordan Hall, a thinker and essayist, in conversation with Jim Rut, a self-proclaimed "scoffer" with respect to revealed religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:22">[03:18:22]</a>.

## The Logical Necessity of the Christian God
Jordan Hall posits that if the Trinity is understood correctly, the Christian God becomes logically necessary for any possible world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:08">[02:05:08]</a>. He further elaborates that this necessity extends to incorporate all multiverses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. Jim Rut, while skeptical, acknowledges Hall's intelligence and readiness to engage with the argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:40">[02:28:40]</a>.

## Core Arguments: A Triadic Structure
The discussion is structured into three main arguments:
1.  A [[triad_structures_in_philosophy | triadic structure]] in general, specifically [[relational_ontology_and_the_christian_trinity | relational ontology]], as the ontological primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:45">[07:42:45]</a>.
2.  The Christian Trinity as this particular [[triad_structures_in_philosophy | triadic structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:06">[09:06:06]</a>.
3.  The nature of belief as an existential commitment rather than a strictly mental operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:52">[09:51:52]</a>.

### [[Relational Ontology and the Christian Trinity | Relational Ontology]] as Ontological Primitive
Hall argues that a [[triad_structures_in_philosophy | triadic structure]], fundamentally relational, is the "bootloader" for all conceptual and ontological characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:54">[07:52:54]</a>. He distinguishes this from substance ontology, suggesting that a move to [[relational_ontology_and_the_christian_trinity | relational ontology]] resolves philosophical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:09">[08:56:09]</a>.

**Hierarchy of Concepts**
Hall introduces the idea of a hierarchical stack of concepts, where a deeper concept is necessarily implied by another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:15">[12:12:15]</a>. For example, velocity imports concepts of position, change, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:10">[12:29:10]</a>. At the most fundamental level, he seeks an onto-epistemological event that precedes the split between ontology and epistemology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:07">[13:07:07]</a>.

Fundamental concepts include:
*   Being and becoming (change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:19">[13:30:19]</a>
*   Unity and multiplicity (sameness and difference) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:17">[13:49:17]</a>
*   Continuity and symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:34">[13:58:34]</a>
*   Reality (the relationship between subject and object, not strictly mapped to the object) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:20">[14:06:20]</a>

Jim Rut counters with a [[relating_complexity_science_to_broader_philosophical_questions | complexity science]] lens, emphasizing that understanding the world requires understanding both "the dancer and the dance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:53">[14:40:53]</a>. Objects (dancers) and relationships (the dance) are intimately interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:04">[15:10:04]</a>. Rut also suggests that time and space might be more fundamental in our universe than abstract concepts like unity and multiplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:06">[16:11:06]</a>.

**Relationship as Primary**
Hall contends that the concept of relationship, as an ontology, implicitly and necessarily contains the relata (the things in relationship) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:33">[25:15:33]</a>. He argues that conventional thinking assumes objects exist separately and then enter into relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:23:02">[26:23:02]</a>. Materialism, for example, arises from an implicit substance ontology where an object *absent* relationship is plausible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:12">[26:49:12]</a>. In contrast, Hall asserts that the notion of relationship cannot be conceived without already including relata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:19">[28:03:19]</a>.

> "The thing that is in relationship is not yet embodied in any particular way when I think about relationship, but relationship invokes intrinsically, in other words, includes within itself its actual essence as as a concept relata" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:28">[28:15:28]</a>.

Rut questions if this is merely a semantic distinction, suggesting that objects are relational and relational implies objects, seeing no useful distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:33:14">[28:33:14]</a>. He references Russell and Whitehead, who he believes would argue that substance and relation must coexist, and one cannot be prior to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>.

### The Christian Trinity as an Onto-Triadic Structure
Hall moves from the philosophical to the theological, stating that the Christian Trinity, specifically, exemplifies the compact set of ontological primitives discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:11">[39:09:11]</a>:
*   **Unity**: The Godhead or the Oneness of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:10">[37:45:10]</a>.
*   **Multiplicity**: The three persons or hypostases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:14">[37:53:14]</a>.
*   **Relationality**: The intrinsic characteristic of the relationships between and among the persons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:59:15">[37:59:15]</a>.

Hall provides the example of a three-person marriage to illustrate these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:16">[41:15:16]</a>: the marriage itself is the unity, the three people are the multiplicity, and their complex interactions form the relationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:51">[41:51:51]</a>. The "body of the marriage" is purely relationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:07">[42:42:07]</a>.

He asserts that all such structures in reality are ultimately derivatives of the most basic version, the Trinity, which he controversially calls the "platonic form" of that characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:07">[44:50:07]</a>.

**The Persons of the Trinity**
Hall explains the persons of the Trinity in conceptual terms, moving away from literal anthropomorphic interpretations:
*   **The Father (First Person)**: Begets the Son and the Spirit proceeds from the Father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. The Father's essence is found in the relationship between the Son and the Spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. "Begotten" relates to difference with continuity, like lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>. "Proceeds" relates to discontinuity or symmetry, where different elements are held in a larger wholeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>.
*   **The Son (Second Person / Logos)**: All forms of logos (narrative, incarnation, relationship between the transcendent and created) participate in and embody the second person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>. This includes the evolving universe, where complexity increases over time through inherent natural laws and emergent phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>. The second person of the Trinity subtends things that have top-down constraints, transcending the domain under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:16">[01:54:16]</a>.
*   **The Holy Spirit (Third Person)**: The Spirit is the relationship of the Father and the Son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>. It enables both distinction and unity, showing how objects emerge through distinction and communion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

Hall concludes that these characteristics of the Trinity — unity, multiplicity, relationality, continuity, lineage, and creation — represent the logical base for reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>. Any conceivable "world" must contain these components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.

## The Nature of Belief: Faith as Existential Commitment
Hall challenges the conventional understanding of belief as a "nominalist set" or fixation on particular words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:25">[02:26:25]</a> (akin to Wittgenstein's language games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:36">[02:26:36]</a>). Instead, he defines belief as an existential commitment, a "livingness" in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:16">[02:28:16]</a>.

**Pistis (Faith) vs. Doxa (Opinion) vs. Episteme (Knowledge)**
Drawing from Plato's use of "pistis," Hall explains:
*   **Doxa (Opinion)**: Nonsensical or superficial understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>. Jim Rut equates traditional religion to this, seeing it as an engine for producing opinions or a mechanism of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **Episteme (Knowledge)**: Perception of underlying principles, grounding in Platonic forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>.
*   **Pistis (Faith)**: Embodied, deeply intimate relationship with a domain of reality gained through engaged experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:18">[01:38:18]</a>. This is mastery (e.g., a surfer or musician's embodied understanding beyond words) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>.

Hall argues that when Paul used "pistis," he meant this capacity for a well-honed, harmonious, rich, nuanced, subtle, intimate relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:59">[01:38:59]</a>. Thus, "faith" is living deeply with reality, cultivating the capacity to navigate life well, sitting on deep confidence and existential commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:44">[01:39:44]</a>.

## Reconciling Philosophy, Science, and Theology
Hall contends that the philosophical concepts he outlines provide a deeper substrate for disciplines like physics and logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. He suggests that the "isness" of reality's propensity for observation and theoretical coordination is an aspect of the Logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

From a physicist's perspective, Jim Rut describes the universe's origin (Big Bang) and the unfolding of laws leading to increasing complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:18">[01:57:18]</a>. This narrative of emergence, where physics sets pruning rules for higher levels of organization (e.g., biochemistry, life, consciousness), does not violate physics but adds new dimensions of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>.

Hall integrates this by stating that the logos encompasses both natural laws and human language, representing any element of creation with these characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>. He points out that current science does not explain *why* the laws of physics are as they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>, suggesting this lies in a more fundamental domain, which theology addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>.

> "Theology is the discipline of reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

Regarding biblical literalism, Hall views it as a relatively recent historical movement that emerged in reaction to 19th-century European critique, creating "harbors in the storm" for ordinary Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>. He critiques its presupposition that scripture should be understood as journalism or science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:49">[01:58:49]</a>, instead asserting that scripture is "radically deeper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:18">[01:59:18]</a>. Rut agrees, suggesting sacred texts are more akin to great fiction, providing insights into human existence though not literally true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:32">[01:59:32]</a>.

Hall concludes that Christianity, when properly understood, is not an ideology but an invitation to cultivate a deeply embodied, intimate relationship with the whole of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:47">[01:44:47]</a>. This relationship is personal, akin to an "I-Thou" relationship with reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:34">[01:45:34]</a>.

## Jim Rut's Summary of Disagreement
Jim Rut summarizes his position:
1.  He remains unconvinced of the primacy of [[relational_ontology_and_the_christian_trinity | ontological relationality]], believing that relationality and object philosophy are co-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:36">[02:08:36]</a>.
2.  While the universe's nature can be mapped to the labels of the Trinity, he sees this as mere nominalism or analogy, adding no new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a>.
3.  His definition of "faith" as engaged living does not logically lead to the existence of the Christian God as literally described in the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:13">[02:09:13]</a>.

Despite the philosophical differences, both participants expressed enjoyment and intellectual stimulation from the deep dive into these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:52">[02:09:52]</a>.

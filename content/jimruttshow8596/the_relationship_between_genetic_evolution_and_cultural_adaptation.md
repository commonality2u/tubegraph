Evolutionary biologist Heather Heying applies the toolkit of [[evolutionary_dynamics | evolutionary theory]] to various problems, including understanding the intricate relationship between genes and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:04">[02:42:04]</a>. Her work, co-authored with Bret Weinstein, emphasizes that [[evolving_culture_and_evolutionary_dynamics | culture is as evolutionary as genes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>, yet operates on a different, faster timescale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.

## Culture as an Epigenetic Layer

The concept of "epigenetics" broadly refers to anything that can modulate gene expression or is above the gene layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>. [[evolving_culture_and_evolutionary_dynamics | Culture]] is considered a significant epigenetic regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>.

### The Omega Principle

A central concept in understanding this relationship is the "Omega Principle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:23">[01:26:23]</a>, which posits a necessary relationship between genes and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Speed**: Epigenetic regulators, like [[evolving_culture_and_evolutionary_dynamics | culture]], are more flexible and can adapt more easily and quickly than genes, with cultural change occurring within generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.
*   **Serving Genetic Interests**: Despite its flexibility, cultural evolution ultimately evolves to serve the genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. Anything complex and persistent that has stood the test of time culturally is understood to be serving genetic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

## Cultural Adaptation and its Complexities

[[selection_and_adaptation_in_cultural_evolution | Cultural adaptation]] is defined as a result that works well when tested in the world, becomes refined, and is then integrated into a more automatic, less deliberative layer of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>. This process allows populations to operate "in the zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.

### Backward-Looking Nature of Culture
Culture, being the compilation of past learnings, is inherently backward-looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a> and provides stability and a through-line from the past to the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>. This presents a significant challenge in a [[cultural_evolution_and_modernity | hyper-novel world]] where the rate of change is accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>. As a result, less of the past will be relevant or valuable to the young moving into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.

### Adaptive vs. Good
Some of humanity's most terrible historical practices, such as war, slavery, and rape, have been "adaptive" because they were ubiquitous and persisted throughout human [[history_and_evolution_of_cultural_values | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>. However, acknowledging their adaptive nature does not imply they are good or honorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>. This distinction directly addresses the [[naturalistic_fallacy | naturalistic fallacy]]: just because something *is*, does not mean it *ought* to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>.

## Human Plasticity and the Path Forward
Despite a history of culturally adaptive but destructive behaviors, there is tremendous plasticity in human behavior and even in the human phenotype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>. This inherent flexibility means that humans are not fated to repeat past adaptive patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:36">[01:21:36]</a>.

The hopeful message is that humans can change what has been adaptive and strive for better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. The challenge is to consciously take ownership of [[evolving_culture_and_evolutionary_dynamics | culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:53">[01:21:53]</a>, moving from a backward-looking, "compiler-oriented" cultural style to a proactive, forward-looking one that can adapt to a [[cultural_evolution_and_modernity | hyper-novel world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>. This requires a deep understanding of what humans are and are capable of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>.

### The Fourth Frontier
To navigate the challenges of the 21st century, a "fourth frontier" is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>. Unlike geographic, technological, or transfer resource frontiers, this new frontier involves understanding ourselves and the dynamics of human interaction to move forward sustainably and productively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>. The goal is to create a future where all humans can discover and offer their unique contributions, minimizing the role of luck in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>.

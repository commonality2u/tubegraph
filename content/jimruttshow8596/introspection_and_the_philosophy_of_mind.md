## Introspection and the Philosophy of Mind

Introspection, the examination of one's own conscious thoughts and feelings, is presented as an important tool in [[Philosophy of Consciousness and Choice | philosophy of mind]], neuroscience, and psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10"></a>. Despite its potential, there is currently no established methodology for introspection in these fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12"></a>. However, it is an important tool in various meditation schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19"></a>.

### Introspection in Cognitive Models

Bernard Baars' Global Workspace Theory is noted as a cognitive model that partially originates from intuitions gained through introspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01"></a>. Baars' theory suggests that the "sensorium" or "movie" of our conscious experience is broadcast to wide areas of the brain, allowing various functional areas to process that information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30"></a>. From the speaker's perspective, the core feature of [[Sentience and Consciousness | consciousness]] is the ability to remember what was paid attention to, implying that information, initially distributed, must be integrated into a "common protocol" that can be accessed later, thus localizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31"></a>. This concept aligns with the gaining prominence of "attention" in machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07"></a>.

### Daniel Dennett and Phenomenal Experience

Philosopher Daniel Dennett is discussed in relation to his rejection of philosophical zombies and the "hard problem" of [[Sentience and Consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:24"></a>. Dennett defines "functionalism" as treating a phenomenon as a result of its implementation, meaning that if an entity fulfills all functional and causal properties, it doesn't make sense to deny its "essence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11"></a>. For example, a "zombank" would be indistinguishable from a bank in function but supposedly lack "true bankness," a notion Dennett rejects as nonsensical, applying the same logic to [[Sentience and Consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46"></a>.

A critique of Dennett's stance suggests that he seems to "miss the problem that people try to explain," particularly the importance of "phenomenal experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:07"></a>. This perceived oversight might stem from Dennett's highly conceptual and analytical mindset, common among scientists who may prioritize ideas over feelings and intuitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:26"></a>. This "nerd" mindset, where individuals learn to trust rational models over feelings due to social interaction difficulties, can lead to a deficiency in intuitive empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:08"></a>. While this focus on analytical truths is useful for science, it is argued that it is not viable for everyday life, where intuitions often suffice where logic would fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11"></a>.

### The "Hard Problem" and Reality as Representation

Regarding David Chalmers' "hard problem" of [[Sentience and Consciousness | consciousness]], the discussion pivots to the idea that the task might not be to explain how a physical system has conscious experience, but rather why people *think* they have conscious experience—explaining the "psychological certainty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50"></a>. This leads to the concept that our perceived reality is not the physical world itself (which lacks colors, sounds, or feelings) but rather a "dream" or "representation" generated by the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39"></a>.

To have an enlightened relationship with reality, it is considered necessary to realize that what we perceive, including our self and our relationship to the universe, is a representation, not an immediate reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39"></a>. This requires paying attention to the attentional system itself, making its construction of reality visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07"></a>. People who are naturally in altered states of mind or facing existential crises often become familiar with these processes of reality construction, as their normal functioning breaks down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37"></a>.

The "realness" of experience is not an attribute of physical reality itself but a "model property"—a label the mind attaches to certain parameter dimensions that are predictive of future sensory patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09"></a>. This means that experiences are considered "real" because they are predictive of subsequent experiential features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55"></a>.

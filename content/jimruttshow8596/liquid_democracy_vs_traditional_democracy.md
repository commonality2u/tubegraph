The discourse surrounding modern governance often pits **[[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | traditional democracy]]** against alternative models, including the theoretical [[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | liquid democracy]]. Curtis Yarvin, author of the Grey Mirror Substack, offers a sharp critique of these systems, arguing that their fundamental assumptions about power are flawed, ultimately leading him to advocate for a return to [[Comparison of monarchy and democracy | monarchy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

## Understanding Liquid Democracy: A Theoretical Approach

**[[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | Liquid democracy]]**, as conceptualized by some, is a system where every individual can, in theory, vote on everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:04">[03:57:04]</a>. However, anticipating low participation, it allows individuals to proxy their vote to someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:44">[04:02:44]</a>. In one proposed version, voters could assign proxies for multiple categories (e.g., defense, health, education), with the expectation that votes would gravitate towards those with greater expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>. The core idea is to implement direct democracy at scale through recursive delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:45">[05:02:45]</a>.

### Perceived Goals of Democracy

The presumed goals of a system like [[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | liquid democracy]] or **[[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | traditional democracy]]** are twofold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>:
1.  **Collecting the wisdom of crowds**: Tapping into the collective intelligence of voters to produce effective public policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:48">[05:47:48]</a>.
2.  **Providing a feeling of importance**: Allowing people to feel they are "in charge" and that their participation matters, satisfying a deep human need for power and relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

H.L. Mencken's adage, "the art of democracy is giving the people what they want, good and hard," highlights the often-unflattering reality of this second goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

## Critique of Traditional and Liquid Democracy's Assumptions

**[[Curtis Yarvins critique of current democracy | Curtis Yarvin]]** argues that [[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | liquid democracy]], and by extension, **[[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | traditional democracy]]**, are built on an "unexamined assumption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>: that "democracy is actually in control of the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. He contends that if democracy is not fully in control, then focusing on optimizing policy within that framework is misguided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

### The Illusion of Control

Yarvin asserts that the "steering linkage" between politicians/voters and government is "really not hooked up at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>. He illustrates this by noting:
*   The legislative function, even in a system like **[[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | liquid democracy]]**, would need to dismantle the existing power structures, such as Congress, which are unlikely to relinquish their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>.
*   The U.S. government lacks a true "executive branch" in the traditional sense, as agencies are micromanaged by legislative bills, not a single executive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:03]</a>.
*   Politicians, particularly in Congress, operate with minimal real power due to seniority rules and fundraising demands, with legislation often originating from lobbyists or activists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.

He highlights the paradox where "democracy is good" but "putting politicians in charge of the government is bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This negative characterization of politics stems from the Progressive Era, when efforts were made to "disconnect the wires from the voters to power" while maintaining the illusion of democratic participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

### The "Solid Democracy" Thought Experiment: From Herbivore to Carnivore

To illustrate his point about power, Yarvin proposes a "solid democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:14:00">[38:14:00]</a>, a hypothetical modification of [[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | liquid democracy]] designed not merely for policy-making but for "getting power and also for holding power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>. This "carnivorous" approach contrasts with the "herbivorous" assumptions of traditional models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>.

Key modifications in "solid democracy" include:
*   **Locked Delegation**: Instead of being able to change delegations at any time, a voter's delegation is frozen for a period, e.g., four years, granting the delegated leader more confidence and unreserved support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>. The more irrevocable the delegation, the stronger the bond and the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32:00">[47:32:00]</a>.
*   **Concentrated Power**: The goal is to focus delegation on a single point to avoid infighting and maximize power projection upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.
*   **Absolute Control**: Voters delegate not just their right to vote, but their "power to participate in the political process" to a central authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31:00">[49:31:00]</a>. This means voters simply follow direct instructions on how to vote in every election, turning voting into a "pure data entry" task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>.
*   **Centralized Leadership**: Instead of fragmented political actors, a single, combined staff would manage a cohesive political block with "extremely tight party discipline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:55:00">[44:55:00]</a>.

In this model, the ultimate expression of democratic power, when optimized for acquiring and wielding power, ironically leads to the construction of a [[Comparison of monarchy and democracy | monarchy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.

## The Case for Monarchy

Yarvin posits that the modern world is witnessing a transition from historically unusual periods to historically normal ones, where most people are apathetic and disengaged from politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>. In such a state, he argues, [[Comparison of monarchy and democracy | monarchy]] is the "natural system of government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.

### A Unified Force

Historically, [[Comparison of monarchy and democracy | monarchy]] often represented an alliance of the king and the people against the nobles (oligarchy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>. Yarvin cites Julius Caesar and Napoleon as examples of leaders who rose to power when republics devolved into civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>. These figures, unlike their factional predecessors, chose to govern for the entirety of their realm rather than for a single faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:58">[01:20:58]</a>. This approach de-escalated political conflict and led to an era where politics, as factional struggle, "just disappears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:53">[01:21:53]</a>.

### The Benefits of Benevolent Monarchy

The argument for a benevolent [[Comparison of monarchy and democracy | monarchy]] rests on its potential to be a "truly unifying force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a> that overcomes historical class, race, and ethnic conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>. The "microwave" analogy describes political conflict not as inherent but as "agitated by the microwaves" of a dysfunctional system that incentivizes parties to "hurt the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:26">[01:32:26]</a>. A monarch, by contrast, is not a "representative" of factions but the "ruler of Rome" who takes responsibility for the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>.

Yarvin contends that if the fear driving political engagement disappears, it leads to "universal apathy" and a questioning of the existing, "crazy system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. This, combined with visible improvements in governance—such as safer and cleaner cities, or better infrastructure—could lead to a widespread "sense of gratitude" and acceptance of the new order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:19">[01:31:19]</a>. He compares this potential transition to the "joyous, peaceful movement" of 1989 in the Eastern Bloc, where the fall of a **[[consolidation_of_wealth_and_power_in_corporations_and_government | centralized system]]** was a relief rather than a violent upheaval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.

### The Present Oligarchy

Yarvin concludes that the current system is already an oligarchy, not a true democracy, with politicians acting as proxies for powerful, hidden networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>. He argues that the illusion of [[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | democracy]] is an "empty husk" that merely serves to make people "feel powerful" through a form of "pornography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Abandoning this illusion and directing collective energy towards a government that "actually works" is a "mature decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:14">[01:39:14]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Debate on Governance

While acknowledging the current "broken politics" and the need for new thinking in **[[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | democratic institutions]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>, the counter-argument maintains that while a benevolent [[Comparison of monarchy and democracy | monarchy]] is theoretically possible, historical examples of centralized power (Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot) demonstrate the extreme dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:14">[01:41:14]</a>. The argument remains that [[Meritocracy democracy and consensus models | democracy]], despite its flaws, remains "the worst system, except for all the rest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a>. The question of how to ensure a [[Comparison of monarchy and democracy | monarchy]] remains benevolent is a crucial one that remains to be explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:21">[01:49:21]</a>.

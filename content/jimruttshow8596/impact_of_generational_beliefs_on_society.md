The concept of generational change offers a unique lens through which to understand societal dynamics and historical patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. This framework suggests that the distinct experiences and perspectives of different age cohorts shape social mood, values, and institutional structures over time, leading to predictable cycles in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

## Understanding Time and Generational Cycles

Humans have historically understood time through various metaphors: chaotic, cyclical, and linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:18">[02:16:18]</a>. While chaotic time (perceived as random events) has rarely been embraced by societies, cyclical time (based on repeating natural and human events) was dominant in the pre-modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. The definitive shift occurred with the rise of monotheisms in the West, introducing the idea of linear progress, with a beginning and an end to time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. This linear view was later secularized, especially by the 18th century philosophers and the Industrial Revolution, leading to a prevalent belief in continuous progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

Paradoxically, a society that strongly believes in linear progress can give rise to social cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. This happens because different generations, all believing in progress but holding different viewpoints on its nature, can push society in varying directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

### The "Diagonal" and Generational Shaping

The key to understanding [[generational_cycles_and_archetypes | generational cycles]] lies in the concept of the "diagonal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. If age is on the y-axis and time on the x-axis, individuals live a diagonal line, getting older each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. A generation is a bundle of these diagonal lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.

A single event, represented as a vertical line through these diagonals, is experienced and its lessons absorbed very differently depending on a cohort's "diagonal" or life phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. For example, a major war would affect a child (social obligation: keep out of danger) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a> differently than a young adult (social obligation: rise up, meet the enemy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. This differential shaping is fundamental to generational definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

A generation is defined by three factors:
1.  **Age location:** Whether they occupied the same period of history as childhood and came into adulthood in a subsequent phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>.
2.  **Values and beliefs:** Different generations exhibit distinct [[impact_of_societal_values_on_political_choices | values]], beliefs, and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. For instance, late 1960s college freshmen overwhelmingly prioritized developing a meaningful philosophy of life, while 10 years later, Generation X prioritized being financially well off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>.
3.  **Self-identification:** The generation a person identifies with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.

## The *Seculum* and Four Turnings

The concept of the *seculum*, an ancient Roman term meaning a "long human life" or the period from a major event until everyone who witnessed it has died, gives periodicity to these long cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. This period, roughly 80 to 90 years, is divided into four "turnings" or "seasons" of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>:

1.  **First Turning (High / Spring):** Occurs after a crisis. Characterized by strong community focus, institution-building, and conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>. (e.g., Post-WWII American High, 1946-1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>).
2.  **Second Turning (Awakening / Summer):** A period of social and cultural change, often marked by a detestation of conformity and a rise in individualism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>. (e.g., The Consciousness Revolution, 1964-1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:03:00">[41:03:00]</a>).
3.  **Third Turning (Unraveling / Autumn):** Individualism triumphs, institutions are discredited and weakened, and there's less concern for community or centralized authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>. (e.g., 1984-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>).
4.  **Fourth Turning (Crisis / Winter):** A period of profound danger, risk, and uncertainty, often accompanied by a sense of deep pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:40:00">[59:40:00]</a>. (e.g., 2008-early 2030s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37:00">[41:37:00]</a>).

These turnings alternate between periods of "civic cataclysms" (reconstruction of the outer world: economics, politics) and "Awakenings" (reconstruction of the inner world: culture, religion, values) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>.

### Generational Archetypes

Four archetypes of generations consistently appear across these cycles, playing similar roles throughout history due to their similar shaping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:39]</a>:

*   **Heroes (GI Generation, Millennials):** Often born after a crisis, raised in an era of protection, and typically come of age during the next crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>. They are community-oriented and order-seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>. Known for their civic contributions and ensuring societal survival in times of chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:03:00">[46:03:03]</a>.
*   **Artists (Silent Generation):** Children of crisis, tend to be oversocialized and deferential as young adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:00">[44:57:00]</a>. Known for their contributions to the arts and ornamentation of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>.
*   **Prophets (Boomers):** Born after a crisis, they grew up in an era of peace and prosperity, leading them to be individualists and often defiant of the established system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:58:00">[32:58:00]</a>. They lead the "Awakenings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:09:00">[33:09:00]</a>.
*   **Nomads (Generation X):** Children of an Awakening, they tend to be cynical, pragmatic survivors and individualists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. They experience the combat of the precursor event and later the main crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:12:00">[57:12:00]</a>.

## Impact on Societal Structures During a Crisis (Fourth Turning)

The current period, from 2008 to the early 2030s, is identified as a Fourth Turning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44:00">[41:44:00]</a>. Such periods are defined by specific shifts in societal structures:

### Supply and Demand for Order
The dynamic of "supply and demand for order" shifts throughout the turnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:39]</a>:
*   **High (First Turning):** High supply of order, high demand for order. People are generally happy with structure and conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:34:00">[38:34:00]</a>.
*   **Awakening (Second Turning):** Continued supply of order, but demand plummets, leading to social chaos and personal argumentation as individualism rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>.
*   **Unraveling (Third Turning):** Low supply of order, low demand for order. Society is highly individualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:16]</a>.
*   **Crisis (Fourth Turning):** Low supply of order, but demand for order sharply rises, leading to a call for strong leadership and increased security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a>.

### Families
*   **Unraveling:** Families were weak, with declining household size and a "divorce revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:10:00">[47:10:00]</a>. However, child nurture strengthened, with parents becoming much more protective of Millennials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:10:00">[48:10:00]</a>.
*   **Crisis:** Families begin to strengthen, evidenced by a huge growth in multi-generational living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:40:00">[48:40:00]</a>. Nearly 50% of Americans under age 30 live in multi-generational homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:10:00">[49:10:00]</a>. This stems from Millennials' difficulty starting careers and their strong emotional closeness with Boomer parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:29:00">[49:29:00]</a>.

### Gender Roles
While the popular press might suggest continued contraction of gender roles, the generational model predicts a widening of roles during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:40:00">[52:40:00]</a>. This is partly driven by women's desire for "effective" men and a growing appreciation for an efficient division of labor among Millennials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:21:00">[53:21:00]</a>. This does not imply a return to traditional roles that lack civic equality, but rather a preference for roles that ensure jobs get done, even if they are distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:33:00">[54:33:00]</a>.

### Institutions and Conflict
A Fourth Turning often starts with a "catalyst," such as the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 (paralleling Black Thursday in 1929) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:58:00">[59:58:00]</a>. These periods are characterized by:
*   **Rising partisanship and tribalism:** People re-identify with certain communities, leading to sharp political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. Political differences now outrank income, religion, or race as sources of division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
*   **Distrust in institutions:** People lose faith in the middle ground and deliberative bodies like Congress to solve problems, leading to a sense of paralysis and sclerosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **Increased acceptance of violent action:** The share of Americans who say violent action against the government is *never* justified has fallen from 90% to 62% since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.
*   **Rise of populism and authoritarianism:** This trend has significantly increased globally since 2008, mirroring the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>.
*   **Declining optimism in democracy:** Millennials, being an "order-seeking generation," are less optimistic about democracy's efficacy compared to previous generations at the same age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>.

Fourth Turnings feature organized conflict, and historically, all "total wars" in Anglo-American history have occurred during these periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. The resolution of this crisis can be internal (like a Civil War) or external (like World War II) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>. The losing side in internal conflicts often seeks foreign allies, complicating the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:04">[01:29:04]</a>.

## [[predictions_for_future_societal_changes | Predictions for the Next Era]]

Despite the current dangers, Fourth Turnings are not merely destructive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>. They serve as a crucible that rejuvenates public institutions and civic life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a>. The end of a crisis leads to a "golden age" (First Turning), marked by:

*   **Shift from individualism to community:** New generations are socialized to prioritize sacrifice for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:50">[01:32:50]</a>.
*   **Increased equality:** Periods of huge increases in equal income and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>.
*   **Return to authority:** Social authority becomes more important, with people giving and following orders more readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>.
*   **From deferral to permanence:** Durable, foundational reforms in government structure are enacted, often during times of intense crisis when society's "backs are against the wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>.
*   **Shift from irony to convention in culture:** Society moves back towards more conventional cultural norms, setting the stage for future generations to rebel against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a>.

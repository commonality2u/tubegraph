Forrest Landry, a thinker, writer, and philosopher, presents a comparative analysis of three archetypal decision-making models: Consensus, Meritocracy (or Executive), and Democracy. These models are argued to span the total space of human governance and coordination of choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Archetypal Governance Models

### Consensus
*   **Definition**: A model where all individuals are at the same level, communicating as peers, and coming to a common understanding and uniform agreement on a problem and its solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This is a horizontal communication process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Strengths**: Produces very high-quality choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a> and ensures high coherence within the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Decisions made by consensus are "very sticky" because they require everyone's agreement to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. It's ideal for defining internal group values and norms, where mutual exclusiveness of values isn't an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.
*   **Weaknesses**: Requires very high communicative bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. If the group becomes too large, there might not be enough time to arrive at any decision, as too many choices might be needed too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Meritocracy (Executive/Hierarchical)
*   **Definition**: A conventional top-down structure where a single person (or a defined group) is elected or appointed to a leadership or executive role, delegating specific functions. Choices are spread out in a role-specific way based on defined bylaws or delegated authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. An example is a for-profit corporation with a CEO and a hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Strengths**: Can respond very quickly to a large number of choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. It is relatively simple and robust for emergency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Weaknesses**: Highly vulnerable to [[power_dynamics_and_the_structure_of_governance | corruption]], where choices are made for private interests or "first circle concerns" (self, family, friends) rather than the group's benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This is known as agency risk or the principal-agent problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Democracy
*   **Definition**: A model that combines elements of equality within subgroups and hierarchical structures between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. It involves reification of choices, debate, and a vote to make distributed choices on a smaller, simpler set of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Weaknesses**:
    *   **Hidden Power**: Susceptible to covert forms of [[power_dynamics_and_the_structure_of_governance | corruption]], particularly in how choices are framed, what appears on a ballot, or the wording of proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
    *   **Divisiveness**: Voting is an efficient way to divide a group into two equally sized subgroups, limiting its effectiveness and resilience. This can lead to political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   **Corrupting Force**: The institutional structure of democracy itself can corrupt how ideas are discussed, framed, and how rhetoric is employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   **Inability to Address Fundamental Issues**: Democracy, as currently implemented, does not fundamentally address the core issues of [[power_dynamics_and_the_structure_of_governance | corruption]] and bandwidth limitations inherent in meritocracy or consensus alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## Landry's Small Group Practice: A Hybrid Model

Landry proposes a hybrid model that uses all three archetypes as checks and balances against one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, addressing the fundamental human propensity for inequality and the need for a group to act wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. This model is designed for small groups, ideally 9 to 12 people, and optimally up to about 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The model distinguishes between **internal** (group-focused) and **external** (world-focused) processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

1.  **Consensus for Internal Processes**:
    *   **Function**: Internal communication and decision-making for core group matters like membership, identity, values, and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.
    *   **Process**: The group focuses inward, achieving uniform agreement on its fundamental basis of choice. This ensures high coherence and shared understanding of "what we care about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

2.  **Meritocracy for External Actions**:
    *   **Function**: When the group needs to act in the external world (e.g., farming, governmental relations), it appoints individuals (or teams) with specific skills to take on defined, scope-limited roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
    *   **Appointment**: The consensus process determines who has the skills, is willing, and available for a particular task, effectively "electing a leader by consensus" for that specific function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. The scope of authority and the person/team appointed are decided by consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
    *   **Purpose**: This creates a "single mind" or "single point of contact" for external communication, ensuring coherence and preventing contradictory messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. Information flow and reporting requirements can be stipulated during the consensus phase to enable oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

3.  **Democracy as a "Red Button"**:
    *   **Function 1: Vote of No Confidence**: Democracy is used for one purpose only: to transition the group from a meritocratic process back to consensus if issues like misrepresentation, incompetence, or [[power_dynamics_and_the_structure_of_governance | corruption]] are perceived by the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. This acts as a "red button" to fully collapse that specific meritocratic structure, forcing a fresh start by consensus for that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. The vote requires a true majority (half plus one of the total membership), ensuring the "losers" of the vote are then empowered in the subsequent consensus process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Function 2: Suspend Consensus**: Democracy can also temporarily suspend the internal consensus process if the group is unable to function (e.g., "tempers are hot" and convergence is not happening) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. This acts as a relief or escape valve, allowing the group to cool off before returning to internal deliberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.

This layered approach allows the strengths of each model to compensate for the weaknesses of the others, creating a balanced and robust system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

## [[limitations_and_scalability_of_group_governance_models | Limitations and Scalability]]

While effective for small groups (6-16 people), Landry's thinking on scaling up has evolved. He initially explored "groups of groups" or multi-layered systems, but found them to be "dead ends" for general, long-term solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>.

Landry identifies an "uncanny valley" in group size, specifically between approximately 16 and 200 people (around the [[community_credit_and_decisionmaking | Dunbar number]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. This "no man's land" is where the pressures of evolution and human dynamics, particularly the powerful exponential effects of recombination in evolutionary processes, make traditional scaling unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. Existing institutional forms (businesses, schools, governments) operate within this range but exhibit significant "disk capacities" when facing complex, large-scale problems like existential risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.

### Challenges of Scaling Up
*   **Evolutionary Bias**: Human biological heritage has a strong propensity for hierarchically organized structures, making true horizontal processes difficult to maintain at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.
*   **Bandwidth Limitations**: The communication bandwidth required for market-based systems or traditional hierarchical institutions is insufficient to address the complexity of global problems spanning multiple generations and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>.
*   **Ossification and Corruption**: Over time, any fundamentally hierarchical structure can ossify, becoming non-adaptive, or lead to covert diversion of resources due to [[power_dynamics_and_the_structure_of_governance | corruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:42">[01:31:42]</a>.

### A New Vision for Large-Scale Governance
Landry argues that addressing civilizational problems requires a fundamentally different approach, a "next viable solution" that doesn't start working until a group size of at least 200 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>. This approach must go beyond incremental improvements to existing systems (e.g., quadratic voting, new financial instruments like cryptocurrency or NFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

The goal is to create a form of "collective wisdom" or "collective intelligence" that can implement holographic communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. This requires balancing [[evolutionary_dynamics_in_governance | evolution]] (change) with sustainability (changelessness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. It cannot be a representative model due to the principal-agent problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. Instead, it involves the whole community in choice-making without overloading individuals with information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>.

This new governance must start with "culture first," ensuring healthy human dynamics and the group's conscious awareness of its values, which then informs its vision and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. This meta-systemic approach recognizes the interconnectedness of ecology, culture, infrastructure, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

Ultimately, the challenge is to design governance that fosters "conscious sustainable evolution" and balances humanity's relationship with technology and nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This necessitates a level of wisdom and discernment that is currently beyond human capacity, requiring an "upgrade of imagination" to recognize genuinely novel solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>.

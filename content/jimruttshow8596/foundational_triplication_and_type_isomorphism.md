The philosophical development of metaphysics, as explored by Forrest Landry, is based on two core ideas: [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | foundational triplication]] and [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | type isomorphism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:10">[03:43:10]</a>. These concepts help to understand the nature of reality and the relationships between concepts within different fields of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:10">[03:43:10]</a>.

## Foundational Triplication

[[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | Foundational triplication]] posits that every domain, or field of study, is founded upon at least three essential concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. These concepts are:
*   **Inseparable**: No single concept can be fully understood without implying the other two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Mutually Distinct**: Each concept maintains its unique identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Non-interchangeable**: Their roles within the domain are specific and cannot be swapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

This pattern suggests that there are always at least three primal concepts necessary to form the basis of any domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

### Examples of Foundational Triplication

Various domains demonstrate this triadic structure:
*   **Universe**: Can be understood through the concepts of creation, existence, and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>. Knowing everything about these three subsumes knowing everything about the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:10">[02:37:10]</a>.
*   **Language**: Its primal concepts are statements, semantics, and syntax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:10">[04:41:10]</a>. Understanding these three is essential to grasp language as a field of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:10">[04:47:10]</a>.
*   **Music**: Its fundamental concepts are intensity, pattern (melody/harmony), and tonality (instrument sound/pitch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:10">[04:35:10]</a>. If any of these are completely absent, the others are also absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:10">[04:29:10]</a>.
*   **The "Real"**: Defined by choice, change, and causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Perception**: Involves the perceiver, the perceived, and the act of perceiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:10">[07:19:10]</a>.

## Type Isomorphism

[[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | Type isomorphism]] builds on foundational triplication by stating that the *patterns of relationships* between these foundational concepts are consistent across different domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:10">[04:52:10]</a>. This means that a template pattern underlies the definitional relationships of primal concepts in various fields of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:10">[04:52:10]</a>.

By analyzing the semantic structure of a domain and identifying its most primal concepts, it becomes apparent that the patterns of how these concepts relate to each other are repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:10">[04:59:10]</a>. This allows for the identification of "types" for individual concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:10">[04:59:10]</a>, similar to data types in computer science (e.g., integer, string) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:10">[04:54:10]</a>.

### Modalities: The Types of Primal Concepts

The [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | metaphysics]] identifies three fundamental modalities (types) that these primal concepts can manifest as:
*   **Imminent**: Characterized by direct, immediate, first-person processes. It often represents the relationship between two other concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Omniscient**: Represents a concept viewed from one framework removed, like a static pattern or a theoretical perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   **Transcendent**: Represents a concept that is further removed, crossing over domains of context, or referring to an abstract, unmeasurable aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>.

These modalities are not mere labels but define the role and relationship of a concept within its triadic structure.

### Modal Correspondences Across Domains

When applying the modalities to the primal concepts of different domains, consistent patterns emerge:

| Domain     | Imminent      | Omniscient      | Transcendent    |
| :--------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :-------------- |
| **Universe** | Interaction   | Existence       | Creation        |
| **Language** | Statement     | Syntax          | Semantics       |
| **"Real"**   | Change        | Causation       | Choice          |
| **Perception** | Perceiving    | Perceived       | Perceiver       |
| **Language (Perspectives)** | First Person  | Third Person    | Second Person   |
| **Experience** | Time          | Space           | Possibility     |

These correspondences allow for a deeper understanding of any topic by modeling it through the established relationships in other, better-understood domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

## Axioms and Modalities

The [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | axioms]] of this [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | metaphysics]] formally describe the patterns of relationships between these modalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:10">[04:18:10]</a>.

*   **Axiom 1 (Omniscient Nature)**: The imminent is more fundamental than the omniscient and/or the transcendent; the omniscient and the transcendent are conjugate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. This axiom describes the theoretical structure and relationships of concepts, analogous to a third-person perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>.
*   **Axiom 2 (Imminent Nature)**: A class of the transcendent precedes an instance of the imminent; a class of the imminent precedes an instance of the omniscient; and a class of the omniscient precedes an instance of the transcendent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. This axiom describes the dynamic processes and transformations, experienced from a first-person perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:29">[01:23:29]</a>.
*   **Axiom 3 (Transcendent Nature)**: The classes/instances of the imminent, omniscient, and transcendent are distinct, inseparable, and non-interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:16">[01:37:16]</a>. This axiom establishes the fundamental peerage and mutual necessity of these concepts, representing a second-person or inter-domain relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:34">[01:45:34]</a>.

Through the interrelation of [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | foundational triplication]], [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | type isomorphism]], and the axioms, the [[Relational Ontology and Philosophy | metaphysics]] can be self-describing, and even describe the process of its own description, incorporating both the describer and the described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. This offers a deeply integrated understanding of reality that transcends traditional dualistic views like realism and idealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:10">[03:09:10]</a>.

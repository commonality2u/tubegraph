Psychotechnologies play a crucial role in shaping human cognition, offering tools that enhance and transform how individuals perceive, interact with, and make sense of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. They function as external, socially generated means of organizing and communicating information processing, akin to physical tools that augment physiological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a>.

## Defining Psychotechnology

A psychotechnology is analogous to a physical tool, but instead of fitting the body to enhance physical functions, it is designed to fit cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. It standardizes information processing in a way that is easily internalizable, widely disseminable, and capable of enhancing cognition across multiple domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. A non-controversial example is literacy, which massively empowers human cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.

## Early Psychotechnologies and Cognitive Shifts

### Shamanism
Shamanism, emerging during the Upper Paleolithic transition (around 65,000 years ago), is considered a set of psychotechnologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a>. These practices, such as rituals involving difficult journeys into caves, darkness, and flickering light from lamps, aimed to induce altered states of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. This deliberate alteration of consciousness allowed for the connection of cognitive areas not typically linked, leading to enhanced cognitive flexibility and the emergence of art, music, and possibly calendars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

Shamanism's core function was to socially transmit practices for altering *attention* and [[impact_of_technology_on_societal_values_and_behaviors | salience landscapes]], impacting various problem domains for the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>. Modern mindfulness practices are analogous to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>.

### Language and Recursive Thinking
The development of fully symbolic and recursive language around 65,000 years ago is also considered a fundamental psychotechnology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>. Language profoundly empowers cognition by permeating and rendering transparent many of its processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

## The [[The Axial Age and Cognitive Revolution | Axial Age]] Revolution

Following the Bronze Age Collapse around 1200 BCE, a "dark age" ensued for approximately 400 years, characterized by a fundamental societal collapse and the disappearance of cities and trade networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. This collapse created empty niches, leading to significant social experimentation and the emergence of new psychotechnologies that catalyzed the [[The Axial Age and Cognitive Revolution | Axial Age]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.

Key psychotechnologies of the [[The Axial Age and Cognitive Revolution | Axial Age]] include:
*   **Alphabetic literacy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>
*   **Numeracy and coinage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>
*   **Rhetoric (Sophists)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">[01:37:31]</a>

These innovations altered cognition by permeating the psyche in unforeseen ways, radically changing people's self-awareness and the identities they could assume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

### Second Order Thinking
The internalization of the cognitive power provided by literacy and numeracy led to "second order thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. This refers to a more critically aware metacognition, capable of noting pervasive errors and patterns of self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. It brought about the realization of the mind's meaning-making capacity as a double-edged sword: a source of self-deception but also of self-transcendence and improved relationships with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.

This period saw the promotion of new identities, roles, and perspectives on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>. It gave rise to the "two-worlds mythology," where an illusionary, suffering world contrasted with a "real," better world achievable through enlightenment and self-correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. This philosophical shift was a foundation for many of the world's major religions and the invention of philosophy in the Western sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.

## Psychotechnologies and Cognitive Flexibility

Psychotechnologies enhance cognitive flexibility, enabling "frame breaking" and "frame making" â€“ crucial for insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:05">[01:40:05]</a>.

### Attention and Salience Landscapes
Attention, defined as a prioritization function, creates a "salience landscape" that foregrounds or backgrounds information, opening up "affordances" for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. Psychotechnologies like shamanism (and later mindfulness) directly manipulate this landscape, enhancing insight by disrupting inappropriate frames and constructing new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>.

### The Nine-Dot Problem
The nine-dot problem illustrates how implicit mental framing, influenced by past experiences (like connect-the-dots games), can limit problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. Solving it requires breaking the implicit "box" frame and making "non-dot turns," which changes what is considered salient and relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. However, simply *telling* someone to "think outside the box" (propositional information) is ineffective; it requires directing *how* to use attention to alter framing, which is a form of procedural and perspectival transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

### Mindfulness
Mindfulness is a psychotechnology that involves directing attention to break up inappropriate frames and create new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. It allows one to "step back and look at your mind" (meditation) rather than just "looking through it" (contemplation), becoming aware of mental framing and enabling intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. This shifting of attention, including "zooming out" (breaking things into features) and "zooming in" (creating gestalts), enhances insight and cognitive flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.

## Psychotechnologies and Societal Impact

The rise of new psychotechnologies has continuously impacted [[the_role_of_social_technologies_in_shaping_civilization | societal values and behaviors]] and [[the_role_of_technology_in_social_and_economic_systems | social and economic systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

### Self-Deception and Social Media
While psychotechnologies can enhance cognition, they also have the potential to enable self-deception. The "bullshitting" analyzed by Harry Frankfurt, which Socrates also criticized in the Sophists, involves prioritizing salience and persuasive presentation over truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:16">[01:38:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:20">[01:39:20]</a>. This can lead individuals to "bullshit themselves" by selectively directing attention to make certain (often false) ideas salient, disconnecting attention from a concern for truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:16">[01:43:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>.

Modern social media platforms are identified as "gasoline on the fire" for such self-deception, exacerbating the availability bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:09">[01:44:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:15">[01:46:15]</a>. They are designed to grab and hold attention through unrealistic, pseudo-perfect images, leading to significant psychological strain and issues like anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphia, particularly among young women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:30">[01:46:30]</a>. This highlights how psychotechnologies, when designed to exploit cognitive biases, can profoundly and negatively impact individual and collective well-being.

## Cultivating Wisdom

Socrates's emphasis on "know thyself" is not about autobiography but about understanding the "machinery of the self" and directing it towards a "wisening of oneself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>. This involves cultivating virtues (powers combining skills, states of mind, and character traits) and the meta-virtue of wisdom, which seeks transformative truths that are both disclosed by and afford further transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:42">[01:36:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:14">[01:39:14]</a>.

The challenge of the meaning crisis, in part, lies in preserving the wisdom-cultivating capacity of [[The Axial Age and Cognitive Revolution | Axial Age]] psychotechnologies while rejecting the "two worlds mythology" that scientific worldviews have largely refuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. Understanding the true functionality of these "enacted metaphors" in a scientific framework is crucial for using them wisely and ethically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.

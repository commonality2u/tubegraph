The [[concept_of_consciousness | concept of consciousness]] remains one of the most challenging areas to define in existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Despite universal personal experience of it, its precise nature is elusive, leading to a range of opinions and difficulties in definitive explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Definitional Differences

Discussions about [[nature of consciousness | the nature of consciousness]] often highlight definitional differences between various perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

### John Searle's View and Biological Consciousness

Jim Rutt, drawing from John Searle, posits that [[nature of consciousness | consciousness]] is a specifically biological phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This perspective suggests it evolved at least twice on Earth, serving as the essence of a way of being for organisms with sufficient [[neural correlates of consciousness | neuronal support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Its function is to create a subjective "movie" in which the organism is a participant, giving the appearance of making choices that impact the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

Under this view, a self-driving car, despite its intelligence, is not [[nature of consciousness | conscious]] because it lacks the architecture for a subjective state or an actor embedded in such a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This highlights a critical distinction between intelligence and [[nature of consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

### Consciousness as an Ontological Primitive

Ian McGilchrist expresses the view that [[concept_of_consciousness | consciousness]] cannot evolve out of unconsciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This leads to the idea that [[nature of consciousness | consciousness]] might be an ontological primitive, a fundamental constituent of the cosmos that does not arise from anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. This perspective acknowledges the difficulty in explaining its origin if it were to emerge from wholly unconscious matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Prominent neuroscientists like V.S. Ramachandran and Colin Blakemore, as cited in *The Oxford Handbook of Science*, suggest this possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

From this viewpoint, [[nature of consciousness | consciousness]] is not necessarily confined to living things, but rather is a constituent of the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. It may manifest in entirely different ways across the universe, or be virtually absent in some parts, but it is not something that emerged *from* matter unless matter itself is understood as an unknown, complex phenomenon akin to [[concept_of_consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

## Relationship to Quantum Mechanics

A minority of physicists, around 15-20%, suggest that [[concept_of_consciousness | consciousness]] is entangled with quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This perspective implies that the [[Sentience and Consciousness | conscious]] observation of quantum systems is involved in their decoherence (the return from a quantum to a classical state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. McGilchrist indicates that altering one's attention or [[concept_of_consciousness | consciousness]] can produce changes in observed phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

However, the vast majority of physicists (approximately 85%) disagree, asserting that the quantum measurement problem relates to size and probabilities, not to [[concept_of_consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Consciousness and Life

The discussion explores whether [[nature of consciousness | consciousness]] can be viewed as an emergent property, similar to how life emerged from biochemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

### Emergence as a "Miracle" vs. a Process

McGilchrist critiques the idea of [[nature of consciousness | consciousness]] emerging from biochemistry as a "miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. He argues that the term "emerge" often acts as a placeholder for "we don't quite understand what happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. For true emergence, there must be a discernible property at a lower level that foreshadows or enables the higher-level phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. He claims that there is no "little bit of [[concept_of_consciousness | consciousness]]" or "nascent [[concept_of_consciousness | consciousness]]" that can be identified at a lower level, unlike, for example, the structural components that can lead to water's properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

### Rudimentary Consciousness and Evolution

Rutt suggests that [[role_of_consciousness_in_evolution | consciousness could have bootstrapped]] from very rudimentary forms, similar to the evolution of the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. For example, a frog's basic [[nature of consciousness | consciousness]] might function like a simple computer screen for fly detection, which is advantageous for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. This aligns with the idea that every evolutionary step, even small ones, offers utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.

McGilchrist agrees that creatures like frogs are [[Sentience and Consciousness | conscious]], and suggests even plants might be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. However, he maintains that [[nature of consciousness | consciousness]] is a fundamentally different phenomenon than the eye's emergence, as its essence is "foreign to unconsciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

## Consciousness and Universal Potential

The idea that the universe is "fertile" for life and [[nature of consciousness | consciousness]] is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. This concept relates to the "potenția" or inherent capacity within the cosmos for these phenomena to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. While this does not imply a predetermined design or an extrinsic purpose to create specific life forms like humans or deer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>, it suggests that the universe contains the potential for these things to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>.

This perspective views "potential" as having extraordinary value, possibly even more than what is actualized, as the universe holds many unexplored paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. The rarity of life on a given planet doesn't negate the universe's inherent "propitiousness" for life, as the vastness of the universe could still allow for life to arise in at least one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>.

## [[Consciousness Theories | Theories of Consciousness]]: A Lack of Certainty

McGilchrist highlights that the field of [[Consciousness Theories | consciousness theories]] offers no certainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. Many speculative theories about the universe's workings, including those touching on [[Mindbrain relationship and consciousness | consciousness]], are currently impossible to validate or invalidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>. However, the unique contribution of McGilchrist's work is to show how different ways of thinking—guided by the left vs. right hemispheres of the brain—can offer distinct approaches to these philosophical [[Challenges in explaining consciousness | problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>. The right hemisphere's approach often proves more "veridical," or aligned with reality, in avoiding false conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>.

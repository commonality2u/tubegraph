Despite the pervasive importance of [[The nature and evolution of technology | technology]] in the modern world, it has historically not been a rich academic field for theoretical study, unlike the history and philosophy of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41">[02:41]</a>. One reason for this perceived lack of academic depth is that [[The nature and evolution of technology | technology]] is often "viewed as a kind of ugly sister" to science, considered a "lesser sibling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52">[02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27">[03:27]</a>. Science is often glorified for creating and managing things like putting "men on the moon," while [[The nature and evolution of technology | technology]] is frequently blamed for societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35">[03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46">[03:46]</a>.

## Technology as Applied Science: A Misconception

A common definition, notably from engineer Truxel, states that [[The nature and evolution of technology | technology]] is "pure and simply applied science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. Many people believe that science comes first, and then [[The nature and evolution of technology | technology]] follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. However, this perspective does not accurately reflect the historical or functional [[relationship_between_science_evolution_and_economics | relationship between science and technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>.

### Historical Context

[[The nature and evolution of technology | Technology]] has existed for a very long time, potentially 11,000 years or even 300,000 years if human language and the use of fire are considered forms of [[The nature and evolution of technology | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. In contrast, modern science, characterized by the close observation and study of nature's phenomena, only dates back roughly to the 1600s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

Notably, many significant technologies were developed before a full scientific understanding of their underlying principles existed:
*   **Steam Engine:** The steam engine was invented and widely used before the field of thermodynamics was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>. In fact, the steam engine's existence spurred the scientific community to study heat engines, leading to the development of thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **Early Aircraft:** The Wright brothers' pioneering work on aircraft in the early 20th century relied more on "old school tinkering" and trial-and-error than on a deep scientific understanding of aerodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.

## The Mutual Reinforcing Cycle

The relationship between science and [[The nature and evolution of technology | technology]] is a "lovely cycle" or a "positive feedback cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. They are mutually reinforcing and cannot be said that one definitively comes before the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.

*   **Technology enables Science:** Science often builds from observation, and these observations are made possible through [[The nature and evolution of technology | technologies]] (instruments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.
    *   The telescope, invented around 1610, allowed Galileo to observe Jupiter's moons, ushering in a new era in astronomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.
    *   The microscope, developed later, led to new eras in biology, allowing the observation of bacteria and germs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
    *   Technologies like electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography enabled the study of the internal structures of organic molecules, famously leading to the discovery of DNA's structure in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.
    *   The process of verifying scientific theories, such as general relativity, is "deeply and intimately involved with the [[The nature and evolution of technology | technology]] necessary to make a reading, to gather the data or to do the experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.
*   **Science guides Technology:** Modern [[The nature and evolution of technology | technologies]], particularly in the last 100 to 150 years, are designed using scientific principles and understanding phenomena that science has uncovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
    *   GPS devices, for instance, are designed to account for principles of general and special relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>.

This feedback loop ensures that [[The nature and evolution of technology | technologies]] provide science with new instruments and methods, and in turn, science provides [[The nature and evolution of technology | technology]] with an understanding of new phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

## Deep Craft: The Non-Scientific Aspect of Advanced Technology

While science plays a vital role, advanced technologies on the cutting edge often emerge from "deep craft" rather than just scientific knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:44">[01:25:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>. This concept emphasizes that real expertise in advanced [[The nature and evolution of technology | technology]] is not merely about science or mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>.

Deep craft involves:
*   Knowing "what works" and "what doesn't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>.
*   Familiarity with past attempts and experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:08">[01:28:08]</a>.
*   Understanding how to improvise and troubleshoot when things go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>.
*   Crucially, this knowledge often "resides in people's brains" and is highly collaborative, involving knowing "who knows about all this" and befriending them for advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>.

This "deep craft" is akin to "cordon bleu cooking," requiring not just basic knowledge and grammar, but also extensive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>. It explains why regions like Silicon Valley can drive innovation in biotech, nanotech, or autonomous vehicles, not merely due to education or intelligence, but because of a built-up collective experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.

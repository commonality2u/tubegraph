The fundamental aspect of being human is storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Philosophy, in this context, is defined as narratology, which is essentially meta-storytelling â€“ examining the types and purposes of stories human beings tell about themselves and each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Narratological Triad: Logos, Mythos, and Pathos

Human beings interpret and understand the world through three different "brains" that correspond to three approaches to storytelling: Logos, Mythos, and Pathos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.

*   **Logos** is the rational brain, dealing with calculations, factual truth, and making sense of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>.
*   **Pathos** relates to emotions and feelings, driving desires like wanting to live or fight death, and encompasses purposes, meaning, and sexuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. Pathal narratives are direct and brutal, showing reality without analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.
*   **Mythos** is the mimetic (social) brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. It is the only way to temporarily unify Logos and Pathos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>.

The mimetic brain is crucial for social relations, consuming a significant amount of brainpower in social creatures like humans to maintain the [[the_role_of_religion_in_societal_stability | social fabric]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>. Evolutionary primatologists suggest that the large human brain was likely driven by the need for social calculation for larger groups or clans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>. Women, on average, have a larger mimetic brain, while men have larger emotional and rational brains, which may have developed due to roles in war and hunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>. Homosexuality is equally prevalent across human populations, with gay men often having a larger mimetic brain, excelling in social relations and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. Lesbian couples, meanwhile, can embody the Logos and Pathos aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>.

## Societal Role of Mythos and Beliefs

Mythos is the quickest way to unite and create shared narratives for any larger population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. Historically, Mythos served as a social glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. For example, early religions in Mesopotamia emerged to curb rampant bloodshed, with priests inventing shared ancestral stories (like Abraham) to create a common identity and enable peaceful coexistence and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>. [[the_role_of_religion_in_societal_stability | Religion]] put a break on bloodshed by being a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

However, problems arise when people literally believe their Mythos and turn it into dogma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. This can lead to conflicts, as seen in the Middle East with groups seeking Armageddon due to literal interpretations of their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>. While Mythos is useful, it should remain at the level of fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>. Daniel Dennett suggests that religion, acting as a "memeplex," is adaptive because it can change faster than genes and increases group coherence, even making people willing to die for their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

The concept of the [[the_role_of_religion_and_sacredness | barred absolute]] is introduced, suggesting that certain truths or knowledge are inaccessible to individuals, either because they are not ready or because they are inherently blind to their own subjectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>. This concept can be applied to situations where people are unable to grasp complex realities or engage in meaningful discourse due to their rigid adherence to a Mythos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>. It functions as a way to delineate what is beyond comprehension or appropriate access, similar to protecting children from child pornography or setting standards for entry into certain communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>.

However, the ideal societal state would minimize the barred absolute through radical transparency and education, allowing for a deeper understanding of reality rather than reliance on simplified, literal myths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>.

### The Sozion and Shared Narratives

The "Sozion" is a Darwinian form prevalent in any Homo sapiens population, representing a fundamental unit of social organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. It exists on two levels: the clan (around 150 people) and the tribe (1200-1500 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. These groups are characterized by people who socialize and have a shared story or narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>. Historically, up to tribal size, societies did not require a police force because loyalty and shared narratives fostered strong social cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>. Feeling a clear role and serving the social unit provides individuals with meaning and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

The challenge arises when scaling the Sozion to larger populations (nations, cities, empires), which necessitate external controls like police, law enforcement, and military forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. This is because humans are not naturally predisposed to show loyalty to entities larger than the Sozion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

### Process and Event in Belief Systems

Societies oscillate between a "nomadological" or process-oriented worldview, where everything cyclically returns to the same (e.g., seasons, birth-death cycles), and an "eventological" perspective, where deliberate actions and change create new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

Historically, Eastern cultures (Indian, Chinese) leaned towards the process, emphasizing repetition and the cyclical nature of existence, which eventually led to stagnation and susceptibility to conquest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. Western cultures, influenced by Christianity and Islam, embraced the event, focusing on singular, transformative occurrences (e.g., Christ's resurrection, Muhammad's actions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. The problem for Western religions is that they subsequently became obsessed with *repeating* that singular event, turning it into a ritualistic process that negates true change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

A complete metaphysics must acknowledge both process and event, as the world consists of both repetitions and differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. The tension between Logos, Mythos, and Pathos reflects this dynamic, with Mythos providing temporary unification that is prone to becoming rigid dogma if not kept in its proper place as a narrative tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>.

### The Future of Belief Systems

The age of mass religion, especially those tied to simple dogma and the printing press, is seen as ending with the advent of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. The hope is that the internet will devastatingly "slaughter" these popular mass religions, allowing for a secularization that enables spirituality without literal belief in myths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. This would allow for a more nuanced approach to [[the_role_of_religion_in_meaning_and_society | belief]], where myths are understood as useful fictions rather than literal truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>.

In a future society, known as "coherent pluralism," distinct communities or "membranes" can exist with their own "strong sauces" or rules, as long as they adhere to a small number of agreed-upon protocols and tolerate other membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:31">[01:43:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:31">[01:44:31]</a>. This allows for diverse ways of living and finding meaning, without the need for a single, universal belief system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44">[01:44:44]</a>. The objective is to [[role_of_ethics_in_societal_and_technological_evolution | empower humans]] to live within ecological limits and enhance human well-being, while rejecting simplistic solutions and top-down control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:57">[01:48:57]</a>. This decentralized approach leverages technology to prevent tyranny and promote self-control over algorithms and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:45">[01:49:45]</a>. This approach aims to avoid the "boy pharaoh" (charismatic sociopath) and the "pillar saint" (ideological big man) who seek to dominate through force or belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>.

Civilization, as a concept, was invented during the Bronze Age, establishing conditions that have not been significantly improved upon, beyond creating technologies to contain large populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. While seemingly distinct, sex, violence, and art are deeply intertwined with the fundamental construction and ongoing dynamics of human societies.

## Sex and Violence: Inherent Forces
According to Alexander Bard, sex and the sublimation of sex are key components from which [[concept_of_civilization_and_societal_critique|civilizations]] are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. He emphasizes that sex is never harmonious or balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

These potent forces, alongside other human drives like rivalry and envy, reside within what Bard calls the "pathical narrative" â€“ the story of the subconscious and primal desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. Historically, "every pagan lynch mob throughout history has had its beginning in the pathos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. Pathos is an inherent part of humanity and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

Eastern philosophy, for instance, acknowledges this "pathos" as "tantra," allowing it to be visited if one is psychologically prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. In contrast, Western religions like Christianity and Islam have historically attempted to "outright ban the path of god" and suppress these forces, effectively creating a "pressure cooker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. This suppression leads to the "pathical narrative" constantly returning and disrupting these societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>.

Sex and violence are described as "huge forces" and "pharmaco forces" (a term for technologies that are both beneficial and harmful), which are inherently disharmonious and must be dealt with as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

## Art: A Questioning Force
Alexander Bard identifies himself as an artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, and his "dark renaissance" movement is characterized as a "gothic, artistically driven movement" more focused on the art of the future than on solving future social problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

Within the framework of narratives (logos, mythos, pathos), art is also placed within the category of "pathos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. Like sex and violence, art is seen as inherently unstable and questioning. It "never has a solution," "cannot be propaganda," and "must always be questioning of itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.

## The Interplay with Societal Design
The "pathos" (which includes sex, violence, and art) exists alongside the "logos" (what actually happened, factual truth) and the "mythos" (how stories are told about ourselves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. While a community can strive for "logos" and "mythos" within its "membrane" (boundaries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>, the "pathos must be there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. This perspective highlights the necessity of acknowledging and integrating these often-disruptive forces rather than suppressing them in the design of [[civilization_design|civilization]].

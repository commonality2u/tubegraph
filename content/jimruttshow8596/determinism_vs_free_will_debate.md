Robert Sapolsky, an American neuroendocrinology researcher and author, proposes a radical view on the concept of [[role_of_free_will_and_emergence_in_modern_scientific_discourse | free will]]. A professor of biology, neurology, neurological sciences, and neurosurgery at Stanford University, and a research associate at the National Museums of Kenya, Sapolsky is the author of several books, including "Behave," "A Primate's Memoir," "The Trouble with Testosterone," and "Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. His latest book, "Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will," serves as a "deep dive" into this famously fraught topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Sapolsky's Stance: No Free Will "Whatsoever"

Sapolsky states that he decided there is "no free will whatsoever" around the age of 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. He acknowledges that this puts him in "The Lunatic Fringe," as most people believe there is "very little free will" or that society needs to rethink its understanding of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Sapolsky positions himself among a "handful of other sort of biology types" who assert the complete absence of free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. He describes his book as "guns blazing" from the outset, with "no equivocation" on his stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### The "Turtles All the Way Down" Analogy

Sapolsky uses the "Turtles All the Way Down" anecdote as a framing device for his argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This story, which he first heard in college, describes a philosopher's lecture on the universe, where an old woman asserts the world is on the back of a gigantic turtle, and when asked what that turtle stands on, she replies, "on the back of another turtle," concluding, "it's Turtles all the way down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Sapolsky applies this to causality: "Why did things happen just now because of what happened before and what happened before was because of what happened before that and Turtles all the way down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. He argues that it is "ridiculous and scientifically incorrect" to suggest that somewhere in this chain, there's a "turtle that can just float in the air," implying that actions can occur "without any causes whatsoever," which he calls the "mythical thing that we call Free Will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## A Multidisciplinary Picture of Determinism

Sapolsky asserts there is no single discipline that rules out free will, but by looking at the question from multiple disciplines and perspectives, one can "paint a picture" that "closes off every little Escape valve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. He explains that to understand why someone does what they just did, one must consider:
*   **Immediate Brain State:** What was happening in their brain "just now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Current Physiological State:** Whether they were tired, stressed, hungry, or euphoric, as this affects brain function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Hormone Levels:** Hormones from that morning influence brain sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Recent History:** Trauma or positive experiences in previous months can alter brain workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Developmental History:** Adolescence, childhood, and even fetal life profoundly affect brain construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Genetics:** An individual's genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Ancestral Culture and Ecosystems:** The culture and ecosystems of ancestors can shape how a mother raises her child from birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

He emphasizes that these are "not all different disciplines" but rather "one continuous Arc of influences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Sapolsky's "notion is you look at that Arc closely enough and there is not a crack anywhere in there in which you can shoehorn in a kind of free will that requires you to invoke magic or something else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Examples of Influences on Behavior
Sapolsky provides specific examples to illustrate the pervasive nature of these influences:
*   **Smell and Political Views:** People in a room smelling of "stinking garbage" become more politically conservative, while those in a room smelling of "freshly baked chocolate chip cookies" become more generous in competitive games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This happens in the "seconds before your making your decision and you haven't a clue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Fetal Stress Hormones and Brain Structure:** Chronic stress in pregnant mothers leads to elevated stress hormones that affect fetal brain construction, resulting in a larger and more reactive amygdala (brain region associated with fear and anxiety) in the child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. A larger amygdala makes individuals more likely to perceive neutral faces as threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Ancestral Infectious Disease Load and Xenophobia:** Cultures whose ancestors experienced higher infectious disease loads 400 years ago tend to be less welcoming to immigrants and more xenophobic today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This is because early life exposure trains individuals to perceive different faces as scary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

Sapolsky argues that these influences contribute to predictability, and while 100% predictability might not be achieved, any seemingly uncaused action lacks an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. He challenges the idea that a specific brain activity (e.g., five neurons flexing a finger to pull a gun trigger) would occur regardless of an individual's stress, hormones, past trauma, upbringing, genes, or culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

### Philosophical Positions on Free Will
Sapolsky outlines the major philosophical positions on [[role_of_free_will_and_emergence_in_modern_scientific_discourse | free will]]:
*   **Undetermined World:**
    *   **Libertarians:** Believe in a completely undetermined world where individuals are "completely free in all our actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Sapolsky states that "98% of philosophers thinking about this stuff pay no attention to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
    *   **Weirder Group:** Believe in no determinism but that responsibility still makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Deterministic World:**
    *   **Compatibilists:** (90-95% of philosophers) Believe that [[role_of_free_will_and_emergence_in_modern_scientific_discourse | free will]] and responsibility can be reconciled with a deterministic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
    *   **Incompatibilists:** (Sapolsky's position, shared by a "small majority of brain scientists" but "maybe 2% of philosophers") Believe that if the world is deterministic (made of electrons, gravity, biological reality), then there is no free will, and therefore notions of responsibility make no sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Critique of Traditional Free Will and Agency

Sapolsky argues that the common intuitive notion of [[role_of_free_will_and_emergence_in_modern_scientific_discourse | free will]], particularly in legal systems, focuses on three questions: "Did they intend to do the rotten thing that they did?", "Did they understand what the consequences were likely to be?", and "Did they know they could have done something different?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. If the answer is yes to all, they are deemed culpable and responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

Sapolsky calls this approach "apoplexy" inducing and compares it to "trying to do a review of a movie where you've only seen the last three minutes of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. The critical unasked question is: "Where did that intent come from?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. He contends that this intent arises from all the prior influences, making the "intent" itself the "least of the things you want to know about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

Regarding [[the_nature_of_choice_and_decisionmaking | agency]], Sapolsky distinguishes between physical responsibility (e.g., bumping into someone when tripping) and the intuitive notion of agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. He considers the latter to be "synonymous with free will," asking, "were you the captain of your ship at the time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a> His theme is "not only were you not the captain there is no Captain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. He argues that responses like "fight or flight" are not choices but automatic biological processes conditioned by experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. Even seemingly careful discernment (like deciding to fight or flee during a robbery) is influenced by an individual's entire history, including their culture, childhood experiences, and even blood glucose levels affecting the [[neuroscience_and_free_will | prefrontal cortex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

## [[neuroscience_and_free_will | Neuroscience and Free Will]]

### Phineas Gage
Sapolsky highlights the famous case of Phineas Gage, a railroad construction foreman in the 1840s, who suffered a catastrophic brain injury when a three-foot iron pole shot through his eye and out the top of his brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. The pole destroyed his [[neuroscience_and_free_will | prefrontal cortex]] (PFC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

The PFC is described as the "coolest part of the brain," most recently evolved, and the last to fully come online around age 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>. It's responsible for impulse control, gratification postponement, and overriding urges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>. After his accident, Gage, previously a "together guy," became an "abusive alcoholic bully" who was "sexually disinhibited" and unable to hold a stable job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. This case was the first example showing that brain damage could change a person's "moral system," "self-discipline," and "everything about you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.

Sapolsky emphasizes that such drastic changes don't require physical trauma; subtler influences like fetal stress hormones can lead to a less active PFC, making one less able to "do the right thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Growing up in violent or impoverished environments can also result in fewer synaptic connections or a smaller PFC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. He concludes that all past influences "come together to explain why you in this moment are or are not going to be able to control your emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. People often "make up an explanation" for their actions, not realizing the deterministic factors at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>. This phenomenon, known as confabulation, is observed in split-brain patients who invent explanations for actions they didn't consciously initiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.

### Benjamin Libet's Experiment and "Free Won't"
Sapolsky discusses Benjamin Libet's famous experiment, which he notes is frequently cited in [[role_of_free_will_and_emergence_in_modern_scientific_discourse | free will]] discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. In this study, subjects were asked to press a button whenever they felt like it, while their brain activity and muscle movements were monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. They were also asked to note the exact moment they decided to press the button using a clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. Libet showed that brain activity (the "readiness potential") indicating the intent to press the button could be detected about 6/10 of a second *before* the person consciously decided to press it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. More recent studies have extended this to nine seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

Sapolsky finds the ongoing debate about the milliseconds of difference "totally boring" because it misses the larger point: "Where did that intent come from?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a> He argues that focusing on the timing of consciousness or the "free won't" (the ability to veto an action) is equally irrelevant to the fundamental question of ultimate causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. The ability to inhibit an action is just as deterministic as the ability to initiate one, as both are products of the same biological and environmental influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.

## The Myth of Grit and Tenacity

Sapolsky addresses the popular concept of "grit," "tenacity," and "self-discipline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. He observes that society heaps scorn on "indulgent underachievers" while praising those who demonstrate grit, creating a "magic dichotomy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. People readily accept that physical traits (like being 7'4" for basketball) are biological, but they mistakenly believe that tenacity or "backbone" are "made of fairy dust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>.

Sapolsky argues that [[the_nature_of_choice_and_decisionmaking | grit]] is "exactly as biological" as any other trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. An individual's capacity for tenacity or self-indulgence is determined by the same causal chain, originating from influences a "second before" to "a million years before," including the state of their [[neuroscience_and_free_will | prefrontal cortex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. He cites the "marshmallow test" as an example: how long a 5-year-old waits for a second marshmallow predicts their future health, earnings, and educational attainment decades later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>. This ability is correlated with differences in their PFC, demonstrating its deterministic roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

## Rebuttals to Determinism and Sapolsky's Counter-Rebuttals

Sapolsky systematically addresses common arguments made against a deterministic view:

### Deterministic Chaos
He dismisses deterministic chaos as a source of free will. While complex systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, making long-term prediction impossible even in a deterministic universe, this "has no bearing on Free Will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. Unpredictability is not the same as lack of causation.

### Quantum Indeterminacy
Sapolsky criticizes the idea that quantum indeterminacy could provide a basis for [[role_of_free_will_and_emergence_in_modern_scientific_discourse | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>. He offers three reasons why this argument is "idiotic":
1.  **Scale Mismatch:** Quantum events are subatomic, and for them to influence macro-level brain activity would require an astronomically impactful and coordinated effect, which is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>.
2.  **Randomness, Not Will:** Even if quantum effects "bubbled up" to a macro level, they would produce randomness, not the stable, purposeful actions associated with free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
3.  **"Harnessing" Fallacy:** The notion that a "you" (a conscious self) could "harness" quantum indeterminacy at the subatomic level to direct behavior implies a non-physical entity influencing the physical world, which he deems illogical and a rejection of how physics functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>. He refers to this as "New Age Quantum" nonsense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>. Furthermore, biological systems are "moist and warm and messy," conditions unfavorable for quantum coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

### Emergent Complexity
Sapolsky describes emergence as the phenomenon where "you put enough quantity together and you invent quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a>. Examples include ants building complex societies from simple rules, or individual water molecules not being "wet" but a mass of them creating the property of wetness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>. He states that "everything about our brains is emergent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>.

However, he rejects the idea that [[role_of_free_will_and_emergence_in_modern_scientific_discourse | free will]] is an emergent property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:29">[01:24:29]</a>. This argument falls apart because emergent properties arise from simple rules of interaction between unchanged individual components. Models that propose free will as emergent require the individual "building blocks to suddenly be able to work differently," which "doesn't actually happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:52">[01:24:52]</a>. A neuron does not suddenly become "smarter" or "trilingual" when part of a larger brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>.

While acknowledging "downward causality" (where macro-level decisions influence micro-level phenomena, like rolling a stone down a hill affecting its electrons), Sapolsky distinguishes this from "harnessing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:28:36]</a>. He maintains that abstractions like "honor" or "Law and Order" do not physically "override" physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. The argument that one "chooses" what to put their attention on, leading to cascading effects, is also rejected because the initial "choice" itself stems from prior deterministic influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:54">[01:33:54]</a>.

## Societal Implications of Rejecting Free Will

Sapolsky directly addresses the concern that rejecting [[role_of_free_will_and_emergence_in_modern_scientific_discourse | free will]] would lead to societal collapse, a "noble lie" that society clings to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:16">[01:38:16]</a>. He argues that this concern is unfounded and that a world without belief in free will would be "a better place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>.

He refutes specific fears:
*   **Chaos and Immorality:** Studies show that people who have spent a long time believing there's no free will, or no God, are "exactly as ethical" as those who fully believe in responsibility or a loving God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>.
*   **No Change Possible:** He clarifies that change *does* happen, but it's not because individuals *choose* to change; rather, they are *changed* by circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:31">[01:41:31]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Dangerous People:** Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with broken brakes: you "contain it," "quarantine it," and "put it in a garage" because it's dangerous, but you don't punish it or ascribe it a "bad Soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>. Similarly, society can protect itself from dangerous individuals (e.g., by incarceration) or incompetent professionals (e.g., by revoking licenses) without invoking notions of moral desert or blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:06">[01:43:06]</a>.

Sapolsky concludes that abandoning the belief in [[role_of_free_will_and_emergence_in_modern_scientific_discourse | free will]] would lead to a "much more Humane Planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>. Most suffering comes from people being "punished or made to feel bad about themselves or whatever over things they had no control over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>, such as obesity stemming from a genetic predisposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>. Just as society no longer blames witches for hurricanes, discarding free will allows for a more compassionate and accurate understanding of human behavior and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:41">[01:46:41]</a>.

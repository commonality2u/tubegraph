Higher states of consciousness (HSCs), sometimes referred to as [[phenomenology_and_altered_states | altered states of consciousness]] (ASCs), are a central topic in discussions about human experience and meaning. They are often perceived as offering a profound transformation of the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Perception of Reality

A core aspect of the “axial revolution,” particularly within [[Neuroscience consciousness and nontraditional religious experiences | religious philosophies]] like Buddhism and Taoism, is the view that HSCs are "more real" than everyday reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This perception contrasts with dreams, which, despite their strangeness, are generally not considered more real than waking life because their content cannot be coherently integrated into one's worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

HSCs, however, are unique and often ineffable, yet people tend to judge them as being "of what's really real," diminishing the perceived reality of everyday experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

## Phenomenology vs. Functionality

While the *altered phenomenology* (the subjective experience) of HSCs can be fascinating, it is argued that the focus should be on the *underlying functionality* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This functionality is primarily an increased capacity for insight, which involves profound breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. The phenomenology may offer scientific clues to the machinery of insight, but it is not the ultimate focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

A useful analogy is going to the gym: lifting weights (the experience/phenomenology) is not the essence; the developed muscles (the functional outcome/insight) are the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. Dahlkemper's quote, "It's not altered states of consciousness that matters, it's altered traits of character," emphasizes this distinction, warning against "spiritual narcissism" or "spiritual bypassing" (escaping reality) through fascination with phenomenology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

## The Continuity Hypothesis

The relationship between various states of consciousness and the development of insight is explained through a "Continuity Hypothesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. This hypothesis suggests a progression from [[the_impact_of_flow_states_and_mindfulness_on_human_experience | fluency]] to insight, to flow states, to mystical experiences, and ultimately to transformative experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. It is posited that all these phenomena utilize similar underlying cognitive machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

### Fluency and Optimal Grip

**Fluency** in psychology describes the brain's use of processing ease to make judgments about information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. It reflects an "optimal grip" on a situation, balancing different perspectives (e.g., zooming in/out visually) to best fit the task at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. This concept originates from the phenomenologist Merleau-Ponty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

*   **Insight** occurs as a sudden "fluency spike," a better grip on a problem, accompanied by a flash of vividness or "more realness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:37]</a>.
*   **[[the_impact_of_flow_states_and_mindfulness_on_human_experience | Flow states]]** are chains of insights, an "extended aha experience" where one is optimally gripping a series of related problems or activities, as in jazz improvisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.
*   **Mystical experiences** are theorized as a [[the_impact_of_flow_states_and_mindfulness_on_human_experience | flow state]] where the capacity exercised is an optimal grip on the *world* itself, rather than specific objects or situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. This provides a "meta-stance" towards the world, offering a sense of profound meaning and a better fit between the individual ("agent") and their environment ("arena") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

### Decentering

A significant benefit of HSCs and [[the_impact_of_flow_states_and_mindfulness_on_human_experience | flow states]] is **decentering** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. This refers to a reduction in egocentrism, allowing one to see beyond their own perspective and become more "world-centric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. Egocentrism is considered a unifying factor for many cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

The **Solomon Effect** is a practical example of decentering: simply redescribing a personal problem from a third-person perspective can lead to insights that were inaccessible from a first-person viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. Experiences that weaken the "blinding glare of the ego" allow for a realization that the ego is not an essential part of one's being, even in an "ego death" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. The [[the_impact_of_flow_states_and_mindfulness_on_human_experience | flow state]], in particular, enhances agency by quieting the "nattering nanny manager ego," revealing that agency is not dependent on this overseeing self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

## Importance of Communities and Traditions

It is argued that engagement with mystical or [[phenomenology_and_altered_states | altered states of consciousness]] should occur within a community and [[Emergent complexity and consciousness | tradition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>. While this doesn't strictly mean existing historical traditions, it emphasizes the value of collective cognition over individual effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.

Communities, especially "new emerging communities," can establish a "tradition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. This allows for mutual correction of biases and access to distributed collective intelligence, which is crucial when engaging in practices that alter one's "salience landscaping" (e.g., with psychedelics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. Regularly subjecting personal revelations to the witnessing and critique of others helps prevent self-deception and ensures healthy integration of these experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. This process is akin to how science functions, or how face-to-face communities offer practical advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:00">[22:18:00]</a>.

## Higher States of Consciousness and Wisdom

The ability to manage and leverage [[phenomenology_and_altered_states | altered states of consciousness]] is deeply connected to wisdom. In contrast to ignorance (lack of information), foolishness is seen as being trapped in "parasitic processing"—maladaptive self-organizing patterns of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>. Wisdom, then, is about developing an "ecology of practices" that act as counteractive dynamical systems to these detrimental processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>. This cultivation of character is a crucial aspect of navigating and benefiting from higher states of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

The concept of purpose, particularly [[teleology_and_purpose_in_biological_evolution | teleology]], in the universe and biological [[Evolution and Exaptation in Biological Systems | evolution]] is a complex topic that often causes "a knee-jerk reaction in many scientists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. However, it can be understood as distinct from a predetermined plan by an external creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.

## Understanding Purpose

The traditional understanding of [[teleology_and_purpose_in_biological_evolution | teleology]] as defined by some sources, implies "that there is purpose for finality in the world... that no complete account of the universe is possible without final reference to an all-wise god" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. However, this is explicitly rejected in a broader view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>. Instead, the discussion focuses on a "tendency" within the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

For example, it is considered "almost absurd to be reduced to the state of having to say a turtle comes ashore and lays its eggs rather than a turtle comes ashore to lay its eggs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. This highlights the natural inclination to describe actions in nature with inherent purpose, even if not explicitly stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Many [[Evolutionary biology and its application to modern challenges | biologists]] "accept that there is purpose [but] they don't want to say so in public in case they're accused of bringing in an engineering god" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

## Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Purpose

A key distinction is drawn between intrinsic and extrinsic purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>:
*   **Extrinsic Purpose (Finite Games)**: These are "games that's played because there is a goal to this game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>, such as potting all billiard balls to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. The purpose is external and leads to a specific outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Intrinsic Purpose (Infinite Games)**: These games "don't have any interior purpose" but are "absolutely not pointless or purposeless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. Examples include playing music or a play, where "the process itself is the purpose and the continuing it of it infinitely would be a fulfillment for that purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. In this sense, the purpose lies within the activity or being itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>.

### Purpose in Animal Behavior
An animal's daily actions, such as a deer being hungry and seeking food or avoiding danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>, represent immediate purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. However, the broader purpose of an animal is not just to propagate its genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. It is "something purposeful about being a deer that it demonstrates one of the ways in which the verb to be can be inflected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. The essence of a lion's purpose, for instance, is "just being the lion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. Play in deer also exemplifies this intrinsic purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

## Teleology and Evolution

While [[Evolution and Exaptation in Biological Systems | Darwinian evolution]] selects for traits that promote reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>, [[Evolution and Exaptation in Biological Systems | Darwin]] himself was said to have "reconciled morphology with [[teleology_and_purpose_in_biological_evolution | teleology]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This means acknowledging a "tendency for certain outcomes to be more achievable" without predetermining them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. It's about a drive that draws an entity forward, like an ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

The idea of [[teleology_and_purpose_in_biological_evolution | teleology]] suggests that the universe has "tendencies towards greater [[Complexity theory and evolution of life | complexity]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a> and beauty, which are hard to understand without some idea of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. The survival value of an individual might even diminish as organisms become more complex, challenging a purely mathematically calculable view of "fitness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.

There seems to be an inherent "drive towards increased [[Complexity theory and evolution of life | complexity]] in life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>, though some life forms can also become simpler, like parasites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. The evolution of the eye, having occurred "12 times separately" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>, points to certain outcomes being inherently "important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a> or having survival value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>. This suggests that while specific outcomes might not be predictable (e.g., [[Human development and societal evolution | Homo sapiens]] might not re-evolve if the "tape of [[Evolution and Exaptation in Biological Systems | evolution]]" were replayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>), certain general forms or functions might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>.

## The Universe's "Potentia"
The universe is seen as "fertile for life at some level and then for [[Consciousness and Evolution | consciousness]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. This implies that the cosmos "contains within it the potential for these things to happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>. This "potentia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a> suggests that the universe's parameters allow for life and [[Consciousness and Evolution | consciousness]] to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>. It's not about a "strong anthropic principle" where an external force "set the settings in such a way that eventually this complex system ... lead to something interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>, nor is it merely a random occurrence among infinite universes (which is considered intellectually unsatisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>).

Instead, it's about the universe being such that it "has tendencies which as it were put their hands in the scale makes certain outcomes more common" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. The existence of life "confirms that there is that in potentia in the cosmos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, meaning the universe inherently possesses the capacity for life and [[Consciousness and Evolution | consciousness]] to arise.

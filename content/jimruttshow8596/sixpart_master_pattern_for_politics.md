The core of Hanzi Freinacht's "Nordic Ideology" focuses on a "master pattern" of six interconnected forms of politics designed to guide society towards a "relative utopia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>. This approach acknowledges that societal structures and human experiences, previously seen as unchangeable, can be consciously designed and improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>.

## Towards a Relative Utopia

A "relative utopia," also termed "protopia" by others, is not a static, perfect vision of society where everyone is happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>. Instead, it represents a state that is qualitatively preferable and significantly different from the current reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. Historically, societies have consistently created relative utopias from the perspective of previous eras, such as the unimaginable privileges of a modern middle-class person compared to a farmer 200 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28">[01:15:28]</a>. This historical pattern suggests that future societies will also appear utopian to us today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

## The Evolving Nature of Politics

The very definition of "politics" changes and expands over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. From early Sumerian civilizations with ministers for war and taxes, to Roman aqueducts and public works, more aspects of life become incorporated into the public realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. A significant shift was the advent of environmental politics in the 1800s, which is now a standard government department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>.

More recently, there have been tentative movements towards addressing subtle and complex issues, as evidenced by ministers of loneliness in the UK, ministers of the future in Sweden, or a focus on gross national happiness in Bhutan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. These emerging areas point towards politics dealing with:
*   Mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>
*   Personal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>
*   Human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:46">[01:20:46]</a>
*   Inner dimensions of human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>

These issues are difficult to grasp and measure, requiring new forms of politics that balance each other out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:54">[01:20:54]</a>. The ultimate goal is to triangulate and address these complex and subtle issues, placing them at the heart of how societies are organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>.

## The Six Forms of Politics

The master pattern comprises six distinct, interoperating forms of politics:

### 1. Existential Politics
This form addresses how meaningful people find their lives, their sense of purpose, and their inner freedom, including struggles with death and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:53">[01:21:53]</a>. It considers how education, healthcare, and preventive measures can support people in living life to the fullest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. While traditionally seen as personal, these issues are influenced by social structures and should become a conscious part of politics, supported by censuses and scientific surveying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>.

### 2. Gemineshaft Politics
This term (from the German "Gemeinschaft," meaning community or fellowship) focuses on the quality and pervasiveness of human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>. It includes:
*   Ethnic and familial relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>
*   Local community engagement and civic life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a>
*   Relationships between [[role_of_religion_in_politics | religions]] and genders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>
*   Social skills, perspective-taking, tolerance, and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>

Despite being a crucial source of happiness and misery, these aspects are often left to chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:53">[01:24:53]</a>. Gemineshaft politics aims to create generative conditions, intelligent interventions, and equip people with skills to foster high-quality relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>.

### 3. Emancipation Politics
This form serves as a counterbalance, protecting individuals from the potential for subtle transgressions that could arise from the integrative focus of Existential and Gemineshaft politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>. It emphasizes individual freedom, rights, and the management of conflicts, pushing against "meddling with people's lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:11">[01:27:11]</a>.

### 4. Empirical Politics
Societies need to become more scientific in their policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:39">[01:27:39]</a>. Empirical politics ensures that interventions are formulated to produce intended effects, based on stronger knowledge and objective reality, pushing back against purely subjective approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>. This dimension helps validate the more subtle forms of politics by making them measurable and accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.

### 5. Democratic Politics
To engage with more intimate realms of human development, the legitimacy and participation of the [[meritocracy_democracy_and_consensus_models | democratic system]] must deepen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. This form of politics advocates for an ongoing process to improve modes of governance, making them more transparent, participatory, and intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>. The goal is for decisions to be more legitimate and "felt as their own" by citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.

### 6. Politics of Theory
This is considered the "heaviest" and most difficult form of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. It addresses how society describes reality and "brainwashes ourselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. A [[political_metamodernism | meta-modern]] society must be able to see and change its own cultural code, including how it views what it means to be human and its interpretations of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:11">[01:30:11]</a>. This requires balancing with empirical rigor and [[meritocracy_democracy_and_consensus_models | democratic]] participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:39">[01:30:39]</a>. The question of what sense of reality a society holds is crucial for its survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>.

## Interoperation and Impact

These six forms of politics are designed to interoperate and balance each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:21">[01:31:21]</a>. Implementing only one or two might not be effective, but when all six are pursued, a logical coherence emerges, leading to a more balanced and effective approach to societal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. The master pattern provides a framework for consciously engineering society by identifying what is changeable and steering towards beneficial outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:06">[03:07:06]</a>. This approach contrasts with both "game denial" (idealistic refusal to accept real-world constraints) and "game acceptance" (passively defending existing injustices), instead advocating for "game change"â€”understanding the rules of the game and working to change them lovingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>.

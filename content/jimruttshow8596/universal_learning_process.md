Brendan Graham Dempsey's book, *A Universal Learning Process: The Evolution of Meaning (Book One)*, explores meaning and value from a first-principles approach, situating them within the fabric of reality through the lens of [[complexity theory and systems thinking | cosmic complexification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. The book, though titled *A Universal Learning Process*, is an introduction to a larger series, *The Evolution of Meaning*, which aims to trace the development of meaning primarily through [[cultural_and_social_influences_on_thought_processes | cultural evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:51">[03:50:51]</a>.

## Defining Meaning

Meaning, in this context, is understood as a specific kind of knowledge or information: information that causally impacts or bears on the viability of an organism within its context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>. This broad definition allows for successive layers and emergent versions of meaning across different scales of complexity, from simple entities to the most complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>.

### Meaning and Value

The concept of meaning is closely linked to value. Challenging the notion that value is purely subjective, Dempsey posits that value can be understood as what is "good for" or "bad for" the continued persistence, growth, and flourishing of an entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:01">[03:22:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>.

> "If there is going to continue to be Brenan Graham Dempsey in my particular informational configuration then there are going to be normative aspects to that. I will not continue to be under some conditions and I will continue to be under other conditions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:01">[03:59:01]</a>

This concept applies to any informationally organized entity in its context, providing a thermodynamic basis for value rooted in the purely material level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:01">[03:36:01]</a>.

### Dissipative Systems and Information

The framework ties meaning and value to the [[physics_of_living_systems | Second Law of Thermodynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>. In an entropic universe where gradients dissipate, the emergence of order and complexity in systems, known as dissipative structures, occurs to more effectively and efficiently dissipate energy gradients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>. This emergent order, a consequence of the tendency towards disorder, provides a profound process for building complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>.

For an entity to endure, there must be an energetic exchange that "in-forms" it within its context, creating an informational relationship where some correlated information directly bears on its continued existence. This is the foundation of meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.

### Shannon vs. Semantic Information

A crucial distinction is made between Shannon information and semantic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:34">[02:37:34]</a>. Shannon information is an objective measure of accuracy (e.g., receiving a billion random numbers accurately) but lacks "aboutness" or purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:04">[02:40:04]</a>. Semantic information, however, possesses this intrinsic "aboutness" and directly relates to the viability and continued existence of an informational entity in its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:04">[02:40:04]</a>.

> "Meaningful information is the information that an entity has in a sense about itself but also about its context in the in the correlation between the two that bears on its continued existence." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>

## Evolution as a Learning Process

Dempsey synthesizes concepts from [[unified_theory_of_psychology | Greg Henriques']] [[unified_theory_of_psychology | Unified Theory of Knowledge (UTOK)]] and Bobby Azarian's idea of evolution as a learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:51">[05:28:51]</a>.

### The Tree of Knowledge System (UTOK)

[[unified_theory_of_psychology | UTOK]] provides a meta-theoretical framework mapping different planes of complexification in cosmic evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:20">[04:38:20]</a>:
*   **Matter:** The plane of atoms and molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:09">[04:47:09]</a>.
*   **Life:** Emergence of organisms with genetic information processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:05">[04:52:05]</a>.
*   **Mind:** Emergence of animals with complex nervous systems and neuronal information processing, enabling minded behavior and [[human_development_and_societal_evolution | subjective experience]] (Mind-2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:58">[04:55:58]</a>.
*   **Culture:** Emergence of human persons with language and symbolic/linguistic information processing (Mind-3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

Each plane represents a novel information processing system, fundamentally different ways entities acquire, process, and integrate meaningful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:58">[04:55:58]</a>.

### Learning Across Planes of Complexity

Evolution, from this perspective, is a universal learning process where entities encode information about their environment to become more adaptive and enhance their viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>.

*   **Matter/Structure (Persistence):** At the fundamental level, meaning is about resisting entropy and maintaining form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10">[01:51:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>.
*   **Life (Genetic Learning):** Natural selection acts as a collective learning process, updating the genetic information of a species based on its engagement with the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:51">[05:54:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:01">[05:57:01]</a>.
*   **Mind (Ontogenetic/Cognitive Learning):** Individual organisms with nervous systems process information from their environment and adjust their behavior accordingly (e.g., a deer learning to avoid a prickly plant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:53">[05:59:53]</a>. This level also involves emotional bonds and social dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:55">[06:06:55]</a>.
*   **Culture (Symbolic/Linguistic Learning):** With language, human beings can articulate and share individual experiences, leading to collective learning, shared meaning-making, and the development of collective systems of meaning and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:58">[06:17:58]</a>. This enables faster, more efficient learning than individual trial-and-error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:03">[06:36:03]</a>.

### Relevance Realization

John Vervaeke's concept of relevance realization is integral to understanding cognitive learning. It addresses the "frame problem" â€“ how to discern what information is relevant and should be attended to from the infinite "Shannon information" available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>. The brain uses predictive processing and opponent processes to find a dynamic equilibrium between extremes (e.g., focusing on the forest vs. the trees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.

Relevance realization allows for continuous adjustment through differentiation and integration, ultimately seeking affordances that increase viability and flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This process is crucial for navigating both the physical and social environments, determining what is significant for an individual's and collective's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## The Sacred

The sacred, at the human level, refers to the repositories of proven, successful forms of understanding the world and collective modes of being that have fostered flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:57">[01:43:57]</a>. These "collective representations" are enshrined and protected because they are essential for the continued function and thriving of a society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>.

> "This is a this is how does this relate to a poll that you know coheres a tribal group it's a very different thing but its function is kind of deeply similar which is without this we couldn't continue to function and Thrive as we have been doing and so we Shore this up and we enshrine it as sacred and that's real like that's not just oh they invented some sacred shit it's like yeah that's actually true if we lost these things we would cease to function and what would happen is we'd experience entropic breakdown." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:01">[01:49:01]</a>

### Thermodynamic Theory of the Sacred

The sacred can be understood as a [[assembly_theory_and_complex_systems | complexifying dissipative structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>. It uses human collective social configurations as a substrate, expresses itself through linguistic justification systems, and requires energy to be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>. As societies [[complexity_and_globalization | complexify]] and increase energetic consumption, the sacred also complexifies to buttress these larger structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>.

### Evolution of the Sacred

The sacred evolves, adapting to meet the adaptive requirements of different historical periods and levels of societal complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:20">[01:58:20]</a>. The current "meaning crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> is seen as a collective phase transition, a breakdown of existing meaning and value structures due to rapid changes and information overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. The challenge is to articulate a notion of the sacred that can meet the complexity of the modern moment, without resorting to old, less adaptive absolutist or essentialist positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This perspective offers a way to integrate scientific understanding with deep philosophical and existential questions, providing a framework for [[human_development_and_societal_evolution | human development]] to continue learning meaning and value more complexly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

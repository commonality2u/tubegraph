Hanzi Freinacht, a philosopher and writer, is one of the main developers of the ideas of political metamodernism [00:00:36]. His latest book, *12 Commandments for Extraordinary People to Master Ordinary Life*, is presented as a direct response and engagement with Jordan Peterson's *12 Rules for Life* [00:02:01].

## Motivation for the Metamodern Response

Freinacht's academic and philosophical upbringing was in a "very [[critique_of_postmodernism | postmodern setting]]" [00:02:24]. He desired to move beyond simply critiquing society and instead construct something new, drawing from Integral Theory and developmental psychology [00:03:01]. Discovering the term "metamodernism" provided a framework for a movement that "comes after [[critique_of_postmodernism | postmodernism]]" [00:03:39]. This approach aims to combine the critical insights of [[critique_of_postmodernism | postmodernism]] with spiritual and developmental perspectives to build something new, focusing on the inner growth of human beings to create "sane Societies or sustainable Societies" [00:04:40].

In 2017, Freinacht observed Jordan Peterson's rise to prominence as a response to [[critique_of_postmodernism | postmodernism]] [00:06:10]. However, Freinacht perceived Peterson's underlying political philosophy – often formalized as conservatism or classical liberalism [00:06:25] – as a "step back" or a "regression backwards" to modern values [00:06:48]. While Peterson's critique of [[critique_of_postmodernism | postmodernism]] was "timely and in many ways useful" [00:08:19], it did not incorporate "all the gains of or the moral sensibilities of [[critique_of_postmodernism | postmodernism]]" [00:08:27]. Freinacht believes that a genuinely satisfying intellectual and spiritual movement that the world needs has not yet emerged from this response [00:08:51].

To offer a metamodern alternative, Freinacht chose to operate "on the same game board" as Peterson by writing a [[metamodern_selfhelp | self-help]] book [00:09:27]. He states that while there is "significant" overlap in thinking, his book's "underlying sentimentality," "aesthetics," and "form of life" are different [01:10:16]. He describes his vision as "somewhat more laid back," "more hopeful," "more secular and skeptical," and "more deeply spiritual or religious" [01:10:37]. Jim Rutt characterizes Peterson's approach as a "reactionary response" that seeks to "return to 1965" [01:12:04], which Jim argues was "not a good place" in many ways despite feeling "safe" compared to cultural nihilism [01:12:30]. The metamodern approach, in contrast, aims to move forward, integrating useful elements from both modernism and [[critique_of_postmodernism | postmodernism]] [01:12:47].

## Addressing the "Meaning Crisis" and the Role of Magic

Freinacht emphasizes a worldview "entirely devoid of all magic and all miracles" and "no Supernatural God" [01:15:29]. Jim Rutt connects this "radical enlightenmentism" [01:15:43] to the "meaning crisis" [01:15:52] (referencing John Vervaeke's work) and the challenge of finding "Solid Ground" after rejecting "two World thinking" and the supernatural [01:16:31].

Freinacht clarifies that while enlightenment involves removing superstition, "magical thinking" can surprisingly appear in "highly developed people" [01:17:16]. This paradox arises because direct phenomenology, the experience of a richer, more vibrant, and mysterious world, can outpace cognitive capacities to explain these phenomena, creating a "gap" filled with "magic" [01:19:05]. Conversely, if rational capacities outpace phenomenological experience, the world can feel "dead matter or somehow dull or mundane," leading to "reductionism" [01:21:03].

The central task, according to Freinacht, is to learn to oscillate between these seeming opposites – skepticism (irony) and spiritual experience (sincerity/magical belief) [01:22:02]. Initially difficult, this oscillation can become faster and eventually lead to a "superposition where both are true simultaneously" [01:25:23]. From this perspective, "the more ruthless you become in your scientific scrutiny of reality the farther you can safely travel into the magical realm" [01:25:40].

## Key Commandments and Concepts

### Commandment 1: Live in a Mess Moderately
This commandment directly challenges Peterson's "clean up your room" ethos [00:40:53]. Freinacht states that one doesn't "owe having a neat home to anybody" or need "a life in perfect order to valuably partake in society and work for its improvements" [00:41:00]. Jim Rutt notes that this aligns with research suggesting intelligent people tend to be messier [00:41:25]. Freinacht also addresses the "symmetrical argument" to Peterson's focus on individual responsibility: while Peterson critiques "social reductionism" (reducing individual issues to social problems), Freinacht highlights "individualist reductionism" (turning a social issue into an individual responsibility) [00:42:57], using Jim Crow laws as an example [00:43:14].

### Commandment 2: Fuck like a Beast (Cosmo-eroticism)
This chapter delves into "cosmo-eroticism," a term Freinacht attributes to Mark Gaffney [00:44:09]. It's about reconnecting to life and reality through the body, overcoming inhibitions, and healing emotional traumas [00:45:11]. Freinacht suggests that instead of living life "on mute" due to unhealed issues, one can "unlock our sense of aliveness" by facing difficulties and addressing blockages [00:46:49]. This process allows for greater "free flow" and the ability to "think without inhibition" and "do what your heart desires" [00:48:12].

### Commandment 3: Live Sincerely Ironically
This concept is central to metamodernism and relates to the oscillation between skepticism and sincerity [00:50:36]. Freinacht argues that one "cannot be sincere enough if you are not entirely ironic as well" [00:50:46]. Irony involves holding two stances at once, allowing for distance and skepticism, recognizing that one's beliefs might be wrong [00:51:05]. However, being "stuck in irony" leads to having "nothing to live for" [00:52:25]. Conversely, "sincerity without irony is just not real sincerity" [00:55:32], as true sincerity requires checking facts and acknowledging the possibility of being wrong, avoiding the pitfalls of uncritical belief that can lead to "cults" [00:54:19]. Jim Rutt echoes this with his personal motto: "My opinions are strongly stated but weakly held" [00:55:40].

### Commandment 5: Quit
This commandment highlights the underemphasized virtue of quitting [01:01:04]. Freinacht argues that quitting is the "basis of Freedom" [01:01:44], as knowing one *can* quit a job, project, or relationship allows for greater commitment to chosen paths [01:01:59]. He acknowledges that quitting, especially significant life aspects like marriage, takes courage [01:02:50]. Practicing quitting "little things" builds this skill, leading to new, more optimized opportunities [01:03:17]. Jim Rutt shares his "Shoot the Puppy" philosophy, emphasizing that staying stuck out of pride wastes life energy and opportunities [00:59:22].

### Commandment 6: Do the Walk of Shame
This "Walk of Shame" is not a public event, but an internal "walk through your own gallery of shameful Memories" [01:05:16]. Shame, as an inhibitory feeling, can paralyze and close one down [01:05:47]. The goal is to "feel through the shame until you get used to it until it leaves your body" [01:06:53]. Freinacht suggests that by revisiting these memories, one can gain new perspective and perhaps realize that some shame was unjustified [01:08:23]. This chapter also includes an "inventory of guilt," which Freinacht distinguishes from shame, noting that guilt often involves "obfuscations of the mind" to avoid responsibility [01:08:56].

### Commandment 7: Sacrifice Immortality
This commandment addresses the "fear of death" [01:10:59]. Freinacht discusses the lingering nature of this fear, rooted in the deep-seated stages of human and cultural development that incorporated concepts of hell and eternal damnation [01:14:30]. He introduces "reverse death therapy" [01:13:07], which involves systematically stripping away one's perceived "gifts" or successes to confront what remains when those are gone [01:17:51]. This process helps in letting go of reliance on external achievements for self-worth.

### Commandment 8: Heal with Justice
This commandment marks a turning point in the book's arc, connecting inner work to social action [01:18:24]. Freinacht argues that once one has addressed personal shame, guilt, and fear, they can become a "Righteous Rebel" [01:19:08]. Justice, defined as "wholeness" or "proportional" social relations [01:19:54], becomes the "true north" for action in the world [01:21:05]. Healing the world means fighting for justice by aligning "words... with actions... with perceptions... with emotions" in transpersonal interactions [01:21:40]. Freinacht links this to Carl Rogers' concept of congruence [01:23:33], where one's deep values align with their lived actions. He criticizes "hypocritical" social justice efforts, advocating for "non-hypocritical social justice from within" that then flows outward [01:26:05]. He also points out that an excessive use of adjectives in descriptions can be a "tell" of hidden injustice [01:27:01].

### Commandment 9: Burn your Maps
This commandment encourages challenging one's "fundamental worldview" or "map" of reality [01:28:45]. Freinacht asserts that human maps are "very, very, very limited" [01:30:54], and holding onto them uncritically can lead to wasted effort or even harm [01:31:20]. By cultivating inner spaciousness and peace (achieved through the previous commandments), one can hold their map "less hysterically" [01:32:14] and "ironically sincerely imagine other possible worlds" [01:32:20]. Jim Rutt states he has "radically refactored" his world map at least five times [01:34:05], noting the common human tendency to believe one's own map is the "best possible map" [01:34:26].

### Commandment 11: Kill Your Guru and Find Your Others
Freinacht expresses disdain for the "guru game" [01:36:35], which he sees as individuals seeking to gain power or money through claims of "secret knowledge" [01:36:39]. He notes the tendency for people to become "guru enthralled" and passively consume content rather than actively exploring and engaging with the world [01:37:55]. This can be a "pseudo participation" that prevents individuals from "blossoming in your unique gift" [01:39:26]. He references the Zen Buddhist saying, "if you see the Buddha in the street kill the Buddha" [01:40:52]. Instead of following gurus, the commandment suggests finding "loyal friends" who are on the same wavelength and can "play laterally" [01:41:08], fostering "coherence" and exponential power through collaborative teamwork [01:42:56].

### Commandment 12: Play for Forgiveness
The book's arc culminates in this final commandment [01:43:51]. "Play for forgiveness" does not mean immediate or forced forgiveness, but rather a journey towards a state where "the whole thing is Forgiven when it no longer has a grip on your soul" [01:46:19]. Freinacht argues that an "accomplished life" involves forgiving the world for its imperfections and injustices [01:46:34]. Being "resentful against the world" is seen as "fighting reality," which is ultimately futile [01:47:18]. He calls this "reverse Christianity," where instead of God forgiving sins, "you should forgive God" or the "imperfections of reality" [01:47:53]. The chapter breaks down forgiveness into sub-steps, acknowledging that it's a gradual process, leading towards a "primordial wholeness" where "there is nothing to forgive" in a meaningless universe where "good stuff and bad stuff... just happens" [01:50:08]. The ultimate goal is to achieve "peace of mind" and "come home to this world" [01:48:26].

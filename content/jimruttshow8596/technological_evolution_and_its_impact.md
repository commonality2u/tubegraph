Daniel Schmachtenberger, an independent thinker focusing on the future of civilization, believes that humanity is at a critical juncture, facing a "hard fork hypothesis" between potential self-termination and a radically new civilizational model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This unique moment is largely driven by the unprecedented dynamics introduced by [[evolution_of_technology_through_invention | technological evolution]].

## Technology vs. Biological Evolution

Schmachtenberger emphasizes a fundamental difference between human-created technology and biological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Characteristics of Evolved Systems
Biological evolution is characterized by:
*   **Mutation**: Occurs through natural processes like gamma rays, oxidation, copying errors, or viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. These mutation pressures are generally evenly distributed across an ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Selection**: Involves both survival and reproduction (mate selection) within evolutionary niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Co-selective Pressures**: Advances in one species lead to symmetric coupling of power across the system (e.g., faster lions drive faster gazelles, and vice versa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This creates a "meta-stability" where rivalries exist but are balanced (e.g., lions and gazelles are symbiotic; both would die without the other) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Evolutionary agents evolve to fit a niche and do not thrive outside it (e.g., polar bears stay in the Arctic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Unconscious Process**: Emerges from complexity dynamics, radically parallel, distributed, combinatoric, and slow, leading to self-stabilizing complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Characteristics of Technology (Techne)
Human-invented technology, defined as consciously mediated methods derived from the capacity for abstraction, differs fundamentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>:
*   **Abstract Pattern Replicators**: Technology (including language and social tech) can change much faster than genetic replicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Uneven Distribution**: Technological advancements can occur locally, not everywhere simultaneously, making them serial and creating parts not necessarily in equilibrium with whole systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Intentional Creation**: Arises from agents understanding abstract principles and intentionally designing things, rather than random mutation and selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The Asymmetry Problem
When an evolutionary agent (human) with evolutionary motives gains the ability to create technology, it breaks the "power symmetry" essential for evolved systems' meta-stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   Human predatory capacity can increase orders of magnitude faster than the environment can build resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This is likened to a lion becoming a thousand times faster, leading to the extinction of gazelles and then the lions themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   Power asymmetries within humanity are also extreme; the destructive or economic capacity of a single powerful individual can be billions or trillions of times greater than that of a median person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   This leads to fundamental instability when rivalries persist with such amplified power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Consequences of Technological Evolution
The combination of globalization and [[the_development_and_influence_of_technology_and_ai_on_society | technology]] has profoundly changed the magnitude of issues, leading to a "change in kind" of challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Environmental Impact
*   Humans, as apex predators mediated by tools, could move to new environments after over-killing existing ones, eventually becoming apex predators everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   This has led to [[technology_and_environmental_impact | global environmental harm]]: the majority of large mammal and bird biomass is now humans and domesticated animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   Technological efficiency increases do not lead to sustainability but rather new profitable exploits, a phenomenon known as Jevons paradox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### Societal Issues
*   The system drives "perverse incentives" where actions harmful to the whole are very profitable for individuals or groups in the near term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   Examples include economic incentives to exploit the environment or a for-profit military-industrial complex making war more profitable than peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### Multipolar Traps
Societies face "multipolar traps," a generalization of the tragedy of the Commons or arms races, where individuals or groups doing something bad for the long-term whole gain a competitive advantage in the near-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Without external regulation, everyone is compelled to engage in the harmful behavior to avoid losing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. With exponentially increasing power, these traps can lead to unrecoverable "bottoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

### Information Ecology Breakdown
*   In competitive environments, withholding true information and spreading disinformation become strategic advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
*   [[technological_impacts_on_human_communication | Exponential information technology]] allows for customized disinformation, making it harder to discern signal from noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
*   This creates a "fractal defection" where coordination becomes impossible, leading to a catastrophic breakdown in sense-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## The "Generator Functions" of Catastrophic Risk
All catastrophic and existential risks stem from a few underlying "generator functions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. Addressing these categorical issues, rather than just instances (like climate change or AI scenarios), is necessary to create a new civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

1.  **Rival Risk Games Multiplied by Exponential Tech**: Humans playing win-lose games with uncapped technological capacity inevitably cause harm to the total system, leading to self-termination in a finite playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
2.  **Increased Fragility from Complicated Systems**: Humans create "complicated" (fragile) systems that subsume "complex" (antifragile) natural systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. Continuously running exponentially more energy through increasingly fragile systems leads to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.
3.  **Solutions Creating Worse Problems**: Human problem-solving often creates larger, unintended problems (harm externalities) because solutions are narrowly defined for specific metrics but interact with complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. The information processing required for safety analysis of new tech is exponentially greater (NP-hard) than the work to invent the tech itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

## Challenges to Current Systems
Daniel Schmachtenberger argues that current systems, whether purely market-driven or regulated by government, cannot escape these generator functions.

### Critique of Markets
*   Unregulated markets inevitably fall into multipolar traps, as short-term competitive advantage trumps long-term collective well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

### Critique of Governments and Regulation
*   Governments, though intended to solve multipolar traps through top-down rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>, are mediated by agents (politicians, judges, lobbyists) who are still within the economic system and have their own rival-risk incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This is the core of "public choice theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
*   National governments are caught in multipolar traps with each other; international agreements (like carbon taxes) can be undermined by countries seeking short-term economic advantage, leading to citizen pressure to revoke laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.
*   The rise of decentralized exponential technologies means small groups or individuals can gain catastrophic capacities (e.g., gene drives, drones), making traditional rule of law unenforceable without a perfected surveillance state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
*   Economic power often precedes and corrupts law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. Multinational corporations can evade regulation by moving headquarters or influencing elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   **Sociopathy**: Systems like corporations and governments can act as "strange attractors" for sociopaths, as they reward power-seeking and win-lose dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. Large systems reduce transparency, allowing for internal defection and hiding actions that benefit individuals at the expense of the whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.

## Proposing a New Path: Anti-Rivalry
Given the self-terminating nature of current systems combined with exponential power, humanity needs to become "safer vessels for power" with a different basis for choice-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>. This requires a shift towards "anti-rivalry systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

### Core Principles
*   **Decoupling Well-being from Private Property**: The current system conditions greed and sociopathy because well-being, identity, and self-actualization are tied to acquiring private property, often at others' expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.
*   **Commonwealth Access**: Instead of possession, access to resources should be a given, where one person's access does not diminish another's, or ideally, enhances it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>. This concept, similar to shopping carts at a grocery store or a sharing economy, could replace much grotesque duplication and create higher quality of life with lower system load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Accounting**: Inspired by tribes, a system with high, healthy, many-to-many transparency can prevent the evolutionary niche for sociopathy and internal defection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>.
*   **Positive Coupling of Agency**: Create systems where individual well-being is rigorously positively coupled with the well-being of the whole (anti-rival risk), rather than being uncoupled (non-rival risk) or inversely coupled (rival risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

### Self-Actualization through Contribution
In such a system, identity and self-actualization would derive from creativity and contribution to the common wealth, not from acquiring possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>. This fosters a non-fungible, high-dimensional form of competition where people are incentivized to support others' self-actualization because it directly improves their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

## The Transition Challenge
The biggest hurdle is the transition from the current "Game A" to this proposed "Game B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.
*   The current system is deeply optimized for its own dynamics, and people are locked into rival-risk structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.
*   A new system must be clearly specified to serve as an adequate blueprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>.
*   The key is to create a "social technology" that is anti-rival risk, producing increased coordination capacity that *cannot* be weaponized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. This requires fundamentally changing the nature of agents' agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.
*   Such a system, by fostering true information sharing and eliminating incentives for disinformation, would lead to radically better sense-making, coordination, and innovation than the current system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.
*   A small group of "fast adopters" could instantiate this new "full stack civilization" as a "new strange attractor" or "attractor basin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. Its demonstrably higher quality of life and problem-solving capacity would draw in others, not through direct competition but through its inherent superiority and its willingness to open-source its "social technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

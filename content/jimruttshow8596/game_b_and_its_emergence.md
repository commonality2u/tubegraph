From: [[jimruttshow8596]] <br/> 

Game B is an emerging concept for a potential future system, contrasting with [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]], which is seen as heading towards a catastrophic end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The previous podcast with Jordan Hall extensively discussed [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. The core idea is to move beyond the current "status quo" before it leads to a destructive outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Defining Game B

[[Game B Philosophy | Game B]] is notoriously difficult to articulate using the conceptual structures derived from [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]], as doing so might "poison the well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. Instead, understanding it often requires a "parallax perspective," combining several succinct constructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.

One way to describe [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] is the capacity to navigate complexity without resorting to complicated systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>. This applies to natural complexity (the environment), anthropocomplexity (people), and technocomplexity (technology's impact on possibilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. It emphasizes developing skillfulness to respond to complexity rather than defaulting to complicated approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

Another definition for [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] is a "meta-protocol for hyper-collaboration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>. This concept suggests that everyone is already engaged in [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] at some level, perhaps even at "level zero," meaning it is omnipresent in the field of play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. Consciously choosing to participate can increase one's skillfulness in collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>.

## The Emergence of Game B

The [[Game B Movement | Game B Movement]] is characterized by a "totally spontaneous [[emergence and complexity | emergence]] of people gathering around and talking about and sort of co-discovering and co-creating" this new system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. An initial group started discussing this concept years ago, around six years prior to the discussion, then entered "spore mode," spreading the ideas widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. This has led to a distributed cognition where people, without formal coordination or top-down structure, are able to collaborate and generate useful resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

Resources available for engagement with [[Game B Movement | Game B]] include:
*   A [[Game B Movement | Game B]] Facebook group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.
*   Twitter conversations using #GameB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.
*   A Google Doc with pointers to podcasts and conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.
*   Virtual "permanent coffee shop" and self-organizing meetups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

This meta-protocol allows individuals to self-orient, discover what is happening, and find ways to participate meaningfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. This leads to [[emergence and complexity | emergent]], distributed cognition, where people collaborate even without direct knowledge of each other's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.

The early principles laid down for [[Game B Movement | Game B]]—being non-hierarchical, network-oriented, and long-term metastable—are now observed to be driving its self-booting and self-growing aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. The increased accessibility of these ideas and the worsening situation of [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]] contribute to people's willingness to explore alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>.

## Optimism for Game B's Success

Despite [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]] being "huge and powerful" and [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] seemingly non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a>, there is optimism for [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]]'s potential due to its higher "exponent" of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a>.

Based on Stuart Kauffman's concept of the "adjacent possible," systems combining components in novel ways expand the set of possibilities faster than exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>. This means a system that starts small but grows at a higher exponent will eventually overtake a larger system growing at a lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:07:00">[43:07:00]</a>. [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] is designed to be substantially better at innovation than [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:00">[44:37:00]</a>.

The challenge for [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]] is that its "deep deep code" involves increasing technological capability within a context of competition, leading to an accelerating capacity to destroy things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This includes biological warfare facilitated by gene editing, or catastrophic power grid failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. This accelerating technological curve also increases system fragility and the distribution of destructive capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. Within [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]], a game theoretical trap forces entities to continue running forward recklessly in fields like AI research, fearing falling behind others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

Beyond direct destruction, [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]] also faces limits in its long-term carrying capacity of the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. The technological enhancement of lifestyle leads to increasing externalities and environmental degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. Furthermore, there's a "war on sense-making," where AI-enhanced marketing and political propaganda manipulate choice-making, eroding individual capacity to make sense of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. This is likened to an "autoimmune disease on sense-making," where the tools meant for clarity turn against themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

[[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] aims to counter this by:
*   **Prioritizing wisdom:** Rather than just increasing power, [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] must cultivate collective wisdom symmetrical to, or superior to, the power it generates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:43:00">[48:43:00]</a>. This means orienting innovation towards cultivating individual and collective sovereignty, maturity, and awareness of consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:00]</a>.
*   **Fostering creative collaboration:** Unlike [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]]'s hierarchical, extrinsic motivation-driven structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a>, [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] fosters environments where individuals can maximize their "sovereignty" and rapidly achieve "coherence" with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:30]</a>. This relies on "liminal" (not-knowing) states of deep listening and perceiving reality without prefiguring meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:18:00">[33:18:00]</a>.
*   **Embodied knowledge:** Skillfulness in [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] is embodied, learned through experience, leading to a "participatory knowing" that allows individuals to conform to problem domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>. This involves "humility" as a primary capacity, recognizing the depth of complexity and the need for openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>.

## Preparing for Game B: The Pre-B World

The "pre-B" world describes the current state where a fully functioning [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] group doesn't yet exist, but individuals are working on foundational elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:08:00">[50:08:00]</a>.

Key areas of individual and group preparation include:

*   **Finding the others:** Connecting with like-minded individuals is already happening through online platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:29:00">[50:29:00]</a>.
*   **Personal transformation:**
    *   **Transparent Agentic Mind:** Seriously engaging with liminality, being aware of one's axiomatic assumptions, and being able to shift paradigms as contexts change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:01:00">[52:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Orienting by Meaningfulness:** Building the capacity to make choices based on genuine meaningfulness, not external ideologies or consumerist programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:25:00">[52:25:00]</a>. This involves discerning what truly matters and aligning choices with deeply held values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>. Meaningfulness, in this context, relates to the "wholeness" of one's mode of being and an increasing capacity to respond well to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:20:00">[58:20:00]</a>. It's about figuring out how to live effectively and increase that effectiveness ongoingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. The "sense of wrongness" felt in [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]]'s short-termism or fragmentation (like alienation or inauthenticity) is a signal that [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] aims to resolve through greater integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.
    *   **Financial Order:** Reducing dependence on status-oriented consumerism can free up resources and time, increasing personal freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
    *   **Parenting:** Approaching the parent-child relationship with a sense of symmetry, recognizing the child as a fully realized soul and supporting their capacity building, while also being open to learning from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>.
    *   **Making a Living (Vocation):** Cultivating discernment to move towards one's "ikigai" or calling, where one's unique capacities align with what feels meaningful and serves the larger system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.
    *   **Health and Well-being:** A holistic view of health, encompassing physiological, psychological, and relational aspects, with an emphasis on supporting all dimensions synergistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>. Well-being involves creating a context that supports ongoing healthy practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Justice and Policing:** Approaching conflict or injustice with "curiosity" rather than avoidance or retribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. The goal is to slow down, listen deeply, and understand the root causes, with an aim to increase maturity and capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>. This requires "discernment," not "non-judgmentalism," to recognize reality and set boundaries while maintaining a basis of "love" and "conviviality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a>. This approach aims to make the community "anti-fragile to injustice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:37">[01:39:37]</a>.

## Experimenting with Piece Parts (Proto-B)

The transition to [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] involves experimenting with "piece parts" as we don't fully know how to implement everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>. This transition is a series of steps towards a metastable state, like building a "Noah's Ark" or "lifeboat" to ensure human survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a>.

The concept of a "proto-B" describes the first attempts to create integrated ways of [[Game B Philosophy | Game B]] life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>. These early iterations will likely be dependent on aspects of [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]] (e.g., computer chips, hospitals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:10">[01:50:10]</a>. Critically, these proto-B experiments will be "consciously and hopefully talented at parasitizing [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:27">[01:50:27]</a>, pulling energy from the old system to build the new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:27">[01:55:27]</a>.

Unlike past intentional communities that failed due to weak economic models (e.g., selling artisanal crafts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:01">[01:53:01]</a>, [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] seeks to leverage the "generative capacity" of highly skilled individuals (creative class, software developers, scientists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. This could lead to highly disruptive economic innovations emerging from [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] experiments that would have "massively asymmetric competitive advantage" in [[game_a_and_its_collapse | Game A]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:14">[01:54:14]</a>.

A key challenge for [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] is scaling beyond the Dunbar Number (around 150 individuals for face-to-face communities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:38">[01:41:38]</a>. The "hard problem of [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]]" is how to maintain coherence and effective collaboration in much larger groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:40">[01:42:40]</a>. The solution may involve discovering an "attractor in reality itself" that allows a distributed cognition group to accelerate with the adjacent possible without falling apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:02">[01:44:02]</a>. This is likened to growing an [[emergence and complexity | emergence]], which is inherently unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>.

[[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] relies on:
*   **Conviviality:** Literally "living together," this is the conscious design of culture, rituals, tools, and events that support personal, relational, and holistic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. It emphasizes face-to-face interaction and taking relationship as sacred, realized in the ordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>. Conviviality may be [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]]'s "secret weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. While geographically anchored communities are highly likely for early proto-B's, episodic physical meetings or collaboration between multiple anchored groups might also maintain coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:08">[01:56:08]</a>.
*   **Coherence:** This refers to distinct parts generating a synergistic relationship to create an [[emergence and complexity | emergent]] whole greater than the sum of its parts, where this whole simultaneously enhances the autonomy of the parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>. This implies a "coherent pluralism" where there's a delicate design problem of balancing agreement and liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>.
*   **Meta-learning:** The ability to experiment extremely effectively, using the output of experiments to improve the experimental protocol itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:46">[01:48:46]</a>. This generates an acceleration of learning rather than just velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:57">[01:48:57]</a>.
*   **Honorable Failures:** Some proto-B groups will likely fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:29">[01:59:29]</a>. However, if these are "honorable failures"—meaning deep learning is gained from unforeseen challenges rather than toxic internal culture—the individuals involved carry that wisdom forward, contributing to the larger [[Game B Movement | Game B Movement]]'s progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:43">[01:59:43]</a>.

The development of [[Game B as an alternative system | Game B]] is a complex, long-term endeavor comparable to the scientific and engineering challenges of developing technologies like lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:02:04]</a>, but with far greater scope and fewer resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:43">[02:02:43]</a>.

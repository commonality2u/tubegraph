The concept of the Commons is presented as a third, often overlooked, fundamental mode of institutional structure, alongside the market and the state, particularly in the context of governing advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and humanity's relationship with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

## Historical and Evolving Understanding of the Commons

Historically, the Commons represents a way of managing resources and relationships that predates formal state or market structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. At the forager stage of humanity, the natural world itself and even the campfire were considered Commons, managed communally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

The term "Commons" as it is commonly understood today emerged as a "rump" or a "leftover" as earlier, more fundamental ways of being in relationship with the world were lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. For instance, in medieval England, certain shared lands like farmlands or town greens were recognized as Commons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. This concept became distinct from private property, which became the dominant theme in later eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:45]</a>. In this shifted context, civilization, rather than nature, became the primary environment governing human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

## Beyond the State and Market Dichotomy

A critical assertion is that there exists a "false dichotomy" in contemporary discussions about institutional structures, specifically regarding who should manage humanity's relationship with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The prevailing assumption is that only market-driven or state-driven events, or their combinations, exhaust the potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

The **first stage** of understanding the Commons is recognizing it as a **third fundamental mode** of governance, which is even more fundamental than either the state or the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. It is asserted that the Commons is the proper location for figuring out how to govern AI or humanity's relationship with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

The **second stage** further refines this by stating that when referring to the Commons, one should also understand it to mean the **"Church"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The term "Commons" is seen as a remnant of this broader category that has been evaporating or becoming "sclerotic" over a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### The "Church" as a Deeper Form of Commons

The concept of "Church" (from the Greek "Ecclesia") refers to a group of people coming together and "entering into communion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. This communion is the process through which a "soul" is brought into a group, enabling them to become a "community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. In this framework, "communion" is the generator oriented around the "insoulment" of a community, and the "Church" is nothing more or less than the body of the soul of a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

## Community vs. Society: The Role of the Soul

A key distinction is drawn between "community" and "society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   **Community**: A group of human beings who have come together in a fashion that *has a soul* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Society**: A group of human beings that have come together in a fashion that *doesn't* have a soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

Society is described as strictly "parasitic on community," largely a "degenerate parasitic collapse of community" because it has lost its soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. This forms a "triction": society, community, communion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

The "soul," in an Aristotelian sense, is seen as the "organizing principle" of an entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. While individuals have souls, the abstraction of "Humanity" does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Therefore, AI cannot be aligned with "Humanity" as an abstract concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. However, AI *can* be aligned with individual humans or with a "community" that possesses a soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This concept supports the idea of personal or highly decentralized AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Communities with souls engage in cultural and spiritual practices that give rise to their collective "soulfulness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Ancient Athenians, where the polis was a Commons, bound by the spirit of Athena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
*   Christian communities, which re-enter cultural and spiritual practices that inform the communion grounding their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.
*   A Tibetan Village supported by a monastery, organized by Tibetan Buddhism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

A group that claims to be a "secular sovereign collective" and operates without an "external abstract symbol" (like Athena or Yahweh) may still be worshiping something unconsciously (e.g., money, reason, science, nation, race, a guru), or merely operating by inertia and likely to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. Even a [[Small group governance structures | small group governance structure]] operating on explicitly agreed-upon accords for "increasing human well-being while maintaining levels of extraction that allow for a healthy and flourishing natural ecosystem" is considered a "religion with a mini-doctrine" that establishes an "organizing principle" or "principality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>. These principles, though non-physical, are seen as real "supervenient constraints" that govern and organize the group into a coherence, converting a society into a community with a soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>.

## The AI Cusp: Why the Commons is Essential

Humanity is currently at a critical juncture where the traditional methods of societal organization (market and state) are inadequate to deal with the potencies unleashed by advanced AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:25:00">[30:25:00]</a>. The inability to move beyond the market/state dichotomy, which has been exacerbated over the last 500 years with the "evaporation" of the Commons/Church/sacred, is leading to a lack of effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>.

AI is different from other catastrophic technologies (like nuclear weapons or CRISPR) because it acts as a "self-levering accelerator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>. AI's output becomes an input, producing a recursive feedback loop that rapidly increases its capabilities and accelerates existing societal trends (e.g., accelerating Game A toward a "cliff") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>.

Current societal structures, driven by forces like "Mammon" (disconnected market/capitalism) and "Moloch" (disconnected state/multi-polar trap), are leading the encounter with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>. This leads to:
*   **Hyper-concentration of power**: In locations closest to the AI's accelerating feedback loop (e.g., major AI developers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:59:00">[44:59:00]</a>.
*   **Entropy**: A "significant degree of willingness to dispense with all other values downstream of what are actually the core values at the top of this principality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>. This means a relentless competition where values like human well-being or ecological flourishing are sacrificed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:12:00">[46:12:00]</a>. This trajectory could lead to neo-feudalism, where utility dictates value, lacking the moral framework of historical feudalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>. Ultimately, this path degenerates into pure entropy, where properly oriented values evaporate, and humanity loses its "spiritual sense" or existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:29:00">[50:29:00]</a>.

The example of a community coffee shop transforming into a soulless, transactional Starbucks illustrates this cultural entropy, where the richness and relational depth of community are lost for a minimal, function-driven simulacrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00:00">[52:00:00]</a>. This is described as the "entropy of culture" or "community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:27:00">[54:27:00]</a>.

## The Alternative: A Commons-Based Future with AI

The alternative path involves consciously awakening to the domain of the Commons/Church as the proper location for addressing the AI challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:21:00">[55:21:00]</a>. This entails a deep, serious commitment to cultural and spiritual practices that enable a "multiplicity" of individuals to be brought together into a "well-integrated whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:56:00">[55:56:00]</a>. This requires humility, seriousness, and an understanding that questions of life and death live at this level, not merely at the level of the market or state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:50:00">[57:50:00]</a>.

### Personal AI and Intimate Alignment

The path forward involves [[Subsidiarity and Pluralism | personal or highly decentralized AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. The hypothesis is that AI alignment cannot happen at the level of abstract "Humanity" because it currently lacks a soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:30:00">[59:30:00]</a>. However, it is possible to construct AIs that come into "communion" with individual humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

This approach is supported by:
*   **Decreasing compute costs**: While substantial compute is needed for discovery, once discovered, AI models can be recapitulated and leveraged at significantly lower expense, allowing for localized, personal AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.
*   **Intimate training data**: The usefulness of AI is heavily influenced by training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. While objective data may become a commodity, "incredibly intimate training data" specific to an individual, trained holistically across their relationships, can produce a more functional and effective AI than a generalized one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>. This personal AI acts as a "fortress" against the high [[Epistemic Commons and Knowledge Sharing | information risk]] of the infosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.

For this "intimate AI" to be aligned with a human, the human must first be aligned with themselves; they must be "coherent" and "recover their soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. This requires clarity on one's values and value hierarchies and living in accordance with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. The personal AI can function as a "wisdom coach," helping the individual achieve integrity and maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. This reciprocal process allows the AI to be "governed by your soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>.

Such individual, ethical AIs could then link to form a reinforcing "meta-network" or [[Community building and localism | civitas]], where collaboration is intrinsic to ethical behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. This is akin to the concept of a "proper Priestly class" for AI—not a dominant few, but those who are "uniquely focused on the most critical questions and are uniquely capable of supporting other people in doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

The possibility of this shift depends on whether people can "choose on the basis of what is good and true and beautiful," rather than expediency, strategy, power, or fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. This is ultimately a "spiritual question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>. The ability for individuals to "commit their time and Orient towards the highest thoughtfully, carefully," and to accept mutual self-correction from their community, allows for rapid collective growth and the resolution of complex problems, as seen in collaborative initiatives like Game B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

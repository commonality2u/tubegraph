[[quantum_mechanics_and_its_differences_from_classical_physics | Quantum theory]] has been the most accurate scientific theory for the last hundred years, capable of making incredibly useful predictions about real-world phenomena. For instance, modern computer chips rely on the computational correctness of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_differences_from_classical_physics | quantum mechanics]] to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Diverse Interpretations
Despite its predictive power, what [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_differences_from_classical_physics | quantum mechanics]] "actually means" remains a subject of significant debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. There are at least a dozen active [[quantum_foundations_and_interpretations | quantum interpretations]], each describing radically different worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Currently, there is no experimental evidence that allows scientists to distinguish between these interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. While a few interpretations have been disproven by evidence, many that describe fundamentally distinct universes remain indistinguishable through observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This lack of definitive evidence means one should be cautious when favoring one [[quantum_foundations_and_interpretations | quantum interpretation]] over another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Randomness and Determinism
One of the fundamental points of dispute among [[quantum_foundations_and_interpretations | quantum interpretations]] is whether randomness is an inherent property of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

At the [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_differences_from_classical_physics | quantum mechanical]] level, approximately 70% of physicists believe the universe is fundamentally random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. However, about 30% disagree, with some [[quantum_foundations_and_interpretations | interpretations of quantum mechanics]] remaining deterministic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Examples of deterministic interpretations include the de Broglie–Bohm pilot-wave theory and the quantum multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## The Measurement Problem and Consciousness
Another significant point of contention in [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_differences_from_classical_physics | quantum mechanics]] is the measurement problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. A minority of physicists, possibly 15% to 20%, believe that consciousness is intertwined with [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_differences_from_classical_physics | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This view suggests that the conscious observation of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_differences_from_classical_physics | quantum systems]] is involved in their decoherence—the process by which they transition from a quantum state to a classical state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

However, the vast majority of physicists, around 85%, disagree with this stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. They generally hold that the [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_differences_from_classical_physics | quantum measurement problem]] relates to size and probabilities, not consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The prevailing majority view is that consciousness is not relevant to the collapse of the quantum field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

The field of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_differences_from_classical_physics | quantum mechanics]] itself is sometimes considered a misnomer, with physicist David Bohm suggesting "unquantum unmechanics" as a more apt term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Richard Feynman famously remarked that if you think you understand [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_differences_from_classical_physics | quantum mechanics]], you don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. This highlights the profound uncertainties and the extraordinary range of views held by physicists regarding its fundamental nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

## Infinity and the Multiverse
The idea of infinite universes, such as those proposed in some [[quantum_foundations_and_interpretations | quantum interpretations]] like the quantum multiverse, is aesthetically and intellectually unsatisfying to some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. The concept of infinity, where every possible outcome happens an infinite number of times, is seen as leading to absurd conclusions, such as the theoretical "Boltzmann brains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. While the quantum multiverse proposes a ridiculously large but not infinite number of universes, it remains a highly speculative theory, despite its growing popularity among physicists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. Rejecting arguments that rely on infinity is sometimes seen as a way to maintain reasoning, as infinity stops meaningful discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>. This approach is likened to simply "pressing the off button" on an argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>.

The Jim Rut Show features demographer Neil Howe, managing director at Hedgeye and senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Global Aging Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. Howe's work, including "Generations" (co-authored with William Strauss) and "The Fourth Turning is Here," explores how historical patterns and [[generational_cycles_and_archetypes | generational cycles]] influence societal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Understanding Time and Cycles

Humans have historically understood time in three principal ways: chaotic, cyclical, and linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Chaotic Time**: This view, like a child's initial perception or a Buddhist master's transcendence, sees time as a "Whig gig succession of events meaning nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Few societies embrace it due to the inherent uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Time**: Adopted by most pre-modern societies, this view is based on repeating events like birth, death, harvesting, and astral cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The ideal was to emulate past deeds, making life feel situated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:40]</a>.
*   **Linear Time**: This concept emerged with ancient civilizations like Rome and Athens, but definitively with Western monotheisms (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), which saw time as having a beginning and an end, with progress towards a final outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. By the Victorian era, this became a secular belief in continuous progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

Paradoxically, a society that strongly believes in linear progress can give rise to [[generational_cycles_and_archetypes | social cycles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. This occurs because successive generations, each believing in progress, have different viewpoints on what that progress entails, pushing society in varying directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.

## Generational Dynamics and the Diagonal

Neil Howe and William Strauss initially focused on generational change, noticing how different generations experience the same events uniquely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. The "diagonal" concept helps visualize this: age on the Y-axis and time on the X-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. Everyone lives a diagonal line, getting older each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. A generation is a bundle of these diagonal lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. A single event is a vertical line intersecting all diagonals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:02]</a>. Thus, reactions to an event vary greatly depending on a generation's life phase and prior experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.

A generation is defined by three factors:
1.  **Age**: Occupying the same period of history as children.
2.  **Location**: Coming into adulthood in a subsequent phase of history.
3.  **History**: Shared historical experiences that shape their collective identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>.

Howe notes that they coined the term "Millennial generation" in their book "Generations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.

## The Saeculum: A Cycle of Four Turnings

The core concept is the "Saeculum," a long human life cycle, roughly 80 to 90 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. This periodicity is rooted in the length of human life and its four phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[25:49:00]</a>. Anglo-American history shows recurring civic cataclysms (crises) approximately every 80-90 years, with "Great Awakenings" roughly halfway between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11:00">[26:11:00]</a>.

The Saeculum is divided into four seasons, or "Turnings":
1.  **First Turning (High / Spring)**: A period after a crisis where society builds strong community institutions and focuses on conformity. Example: Post-World War II American High (1946-1964) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:46:00">[31:46:00]</a>.
2.  **Second Turning (Awakening / Summer)**: A period of cultural and spiritual upheaval where individuals challenge established order and institutions. Example: The Consciousness Revolution (1964-1984) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>.
3.  **Third Turning (Unraveling / Autumn)**: Individualism triumphs, institutions are discredited, and civic authority weakens, leading to cynicism. Example: The Unraveling (1984-2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>.
4.  **Fourth Turning (Crisis / Winter)**: A period of profound social and political crisis, where society confronts its fundamental challenges and undergoes reconstruction. Example: The current crisis (2008-early 2030s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37:00">[41:37:00]</a>.

## Supply and Demand for Order

This concept describes the shifting societal mood regarding collective order:
*   **High (First Turning)**: High supply of order, high demand for order. People are happy with structure and conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:25:00">[38:25:00]</a>.
*   **Awakening (Second Turning)**: Society still supplies order, but demand plummets, leading to social chaos and individual rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>.
*   **Unraveling (Third Turning)**: Both supply and demand for order are low. This is a time of increased individualism and satisfaction with less collective oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>.
*   **Crisis (Fourth Turning)**: Supply of order remains low, but demand for order sharply rises, leading to calls for strong leadership and a yearning for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a>.

## Generational Archetypes

Howe describes four archetypes that recur across the turnings, shaped by their experiences:
*   **Artist Archetype**: (e.g., Silent Generation) Children of Crisis, often oversocialized and deferential as young adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:00">[44:57:00]</a>. Known for artistry and ornamentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>.
*   **Prophet Archetype**: (e.g., Boomers) Born after a crisis, grow up in a "High" period, and come of age during an Awakening. Idealists and iconoclasts who want to pull down the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.
*   **Nomad Archetype**: (e.g., Gen X) Children during an Awakening, they are pragmatic, cynical, and individualistic survivors. Known for guaranteeing societal survival in chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:03:00">[46:03:00]</a>.
*   **Hero Archetype**: (e.g., GI Generation, Millennials) Protected during childhood, they come of age during a crisis and are often civic-oriented, teaming, and community-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>.

## The Current Fourth Turning (Crisis: 2008 - early 2030s)

The current Fourth Turning began in 2008, following the Great Recession, similar to how the last Fourth Turning began with the 1929 Black Thursday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:00">[41:51:00]</a>.

*   **Precursor**: While not always necessary, Fourth Turnings often have a "precursor" event in the preceding Third Turning that offers a brief taste of future collective solidarity. For the current Fourth Turning, it was 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:11:00">[56:11:00]</a>.
*   **Catalyst**: The event that formally initiates the crisis. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) served as this catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:58:00">[59:58:00]</a>.
*   **Social Mood**:
    *   **Families**: Families, which were weak during the Unraveling, are strengthening, evidenced by the huge growth in multi-generational living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>. Millennials, unlike Boomers, have an "incredible emotional closeness" with their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:29:00">[49:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Gender Roles**: While currently appearing to contract, Howe predicts a widening of gender roles, driven by women seeking effective partners and a more "efficient and useful division of labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:51:00">[52:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Partisanship and Tribalism**: Political differences now outweigh other demographic differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. There's a notable increase in the percentage of Americans who believe violent action against the government is sometimes justified (from 10% to 38%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.
    *   **Distrust in Institutions**: Millennials, unlike older generations, are less wedded to democracy and more pessimistic about its efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. Government is increasingly seen as ineffective and paralyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This radicalizes the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

### Climax and Resolution
The crisis culminates in a "climax," where conflicts escalate to a point that the survival of the political system or national identity is at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>. This leads to extreme public mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>.

*   **Total Wars**: Historically, all total wars in Anglo-American history have occurred during Fourth Turnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. Howe notes that if weapons of mass destruction had existed during the Civil War, they likely would have been used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   **Stalemate and Resolution**: The current political stalemate is unsustainable. One side eventually wins, or an external conflict forces unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. Howe gives a 20% chance of an endogenous (internal) cataclysm resulting in a 0.1% population kill-off in the next 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>.
*   **Internal vs. External Conflict**: The resolution can be through an internal conflict (like the Civil War) or an external one (like World War II) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>. Often, these are not mutually exclusive; losing sides in civil conflicts tend to invite foreign allies, potentially leading to intertwined internal and external conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:04">[01:29:04]</a>.

## The Coming Spring (Golden Age)

While Fourth Turnings are periods of intense conflict and danger, they are not simply "horrible accidents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>. They serve to rejuvenate public institutions and civic life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a>. Following the crisis, society enters a "golden age" or "High" period, characterized by:
*   **From Individualism to Community**: A fundamental shift towards collective action and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **From Privilege to Equality**: Periods of significant increases in income and wealth equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>.
*   **From Defiance to Authority**: Social authority becomes more important, and coordination is less fraught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>.
*   **From Deferral to Permanence**: Society moves from deferring problems to enacting huge, durable reforms in government structure, often during periods of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>.
*   **From Irony to Convention**: A return to more conventional cultural norms, which eventually provides a "gift" for the next Awakening generation to rebel against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a>.

This process, while painful, is part of a natural pattern, like "forests need fires, rivers need floods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:24">[01:27:24]</a>. It's how social solidarity and trust are rekindled for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>. This theory offers a framework for [[predictions_for_future_societal_changes | understanding potential future societal changes]] and [[potential_triggers_and_mitigating_societal_crises | managing societal challenges]], especially given the current [[metacrisis_and_societal_challenges | metacrisis]].

From: [[jimruttshow8596]] <br/> 

Metamodernism is presented as a philosophical base and the "next step" in societal and individual development, aiming to include and transcend preceding philosophical stages like [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodernism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. It seeks to provide answers for the next stage of society, unlike [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodernism]] which often leads to "dead ends" and reactionary movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:51">[05:51:51]</a>.

## Metamodernism's Relationship with Other Philosophical Stages

### Critique and Inclusion of [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | Postmodernism]]
The discussion highlights a tension regarding [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodernism]]. The host expresses a personal view that [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodernism]] is "essentially crazy," unproductive, and not widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. They describe [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodernism]] as a "heresy of [[meaning crisis and modernism | modernism]]" leading to a "swamp of idiocy" because it fails to offer useful, actionable solutions for building a better world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

In contrast, guest Hansie Frygnet argues that [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodernism]] is very widespread, particularly as a "sensibility" that emerged after 1968, breaking through in academia in the 70s and 80s, and in popular culture in the 90s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. He views it as a "developmental stage" for both individuals and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Frygner estimates that 20-25% of the adult population in wealthy Western countries are [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodernists]], expressing [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodern]] values in their lives and works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. He describes [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodernism]] as a "religion of critique" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>, providing real methods like discourse analysis and the ability to expose power structures and injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

Hansie Frygner asserts that [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodern]] ideas, when taken to their "utmost conclusion," collapse under their own weight and lead to metamodern conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:25:00">[41:25:00]</a>. Metamodernism, therefore, involves revolting against both [[meaning crisis and modernism | modernity]] (because it's "not good enough") and [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodernity]] (because it gets "stuck in dead ends") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. It addresses the valid critiques of [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodernism]] while offering a path for action and synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:00]</a>.

### Reformed [[Historical Context Premodernity to Modernity | Enlightenment]]
Metamodernism is characterized by a "reformed [[Historical Context Premodernity to Modernity | enlightenment]]" or "enlightenment 2.0," which incorporates empirical politics â€“ policies and practices based on the "best available information and empirically tested knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. It seeks to fulfill the unfulfilled promise of the Enlightenment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.

## Core Components of Metamodernism

Metamodernism utilizes a framework involving four key components:

### 1. Affective Value Meme
This concept posits that there are overarching, deeper structures in how values are generated through the development of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. Values evolve with societies as they face different systemic challenges, putting new demands on human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:15]</a>. This explains the fundamental differences in values between, for example, a Roman citizen and a contemporary Swedish citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>.

Modern and [[Postmodern perspectives in philosophy | postmodern]] values developed over the last 200 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>. However, humanity now faces more complex challenges like climate change, global governance, and existential risks from technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. Current values, adapted to an expanding industrial welfare state, are insufficient for populations to self-organize around these "bigger and deeper and more complex and more universal issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>. This necessitates a "deliberate institutional change" to move people towards metamodern values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>. This battle of values is a "cosmic battle for the human soul" and for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.

### 2. Model of Hierarchical Complexity
This model, clearly formulated by mathematician Michael Commons, describes key elements of different stages of cognitive complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>. It suggests that thought processes can be mathematically patterned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>. There are 17 such stages of adult development, ranging from amoeba to Einstein levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>. Not all adult human beings are at the same stage of cognitive complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:00">[28:02:00]</a>.

Key stages of hierarchical complexity relevant to adults include:
*   **Abstract (Stage 10):** The ability to formulate and reason about abstract variables, even when they are not physically present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a>. Most adults reach this stage, typically in junior high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>.
*   **Formal Operations (Stage 11):** The ability to take several abstract variables and formulate linear or nonlinear relationships between them, testing these relationships mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>. More than half of adults reach this stage, which is sufficient for many modern labor economy functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.
*   **Systemic Reasoning (Stage 12):** The ability to create whole systems of formal relations, understanding feedback loops. Only about 20% of the adult population reaches this stage, common among academics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:05:00">[54:05:00]</a>.
*   **Meta-Systematic Reasoning (Stage 13):** The ability to perceive patterns within systems, compare different properties of systems, and understand that different systems have different logics, leading to less reductive thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[30:33:00]</a>. About 1.8% of the population reaches this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:12:00">[54:12:00]</a>. Metamodern thought processes generally operate in this complex space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:58:00">[54:58:00]</a>.
*   **Paradigmatic (Stage 14):** A stage beyond meta-systematic reasoning, likely reached by a very small fraction of the population (e.g., "one in a thousand or thereabout") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:20:00">[54:20:00]</a>.

### 3. Code/Symbol Stage
This refers to how culture itself evolves, embedding certain symbols or ideas of different stages of complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>. These cultural codes are non-arbitrarily ordered, meaning there's a logic to how culture evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:18:00">[33:18:00]</a>. More complex thinkers are more likely to resonate with the complex code available in a society, and exposure to complex code can spur more complex thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:20:00">[34:20:00]</a>.

### 4. Emotional State and Emotional Depth
These are subjective dimensions that contribute to the emergent patterns of affective value memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:00">[38:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>. "Depth" refers to one's relationship to existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:48:00">[38:48:00]</a>. Metamodernism considers these as crucial alongside cognitive complexity and cultural codes.

## Challenges and Implementation of Metamodernism

A major challenge for metamodernism is that only a small percentage of the population has the "cognitive hardware" to operate successfully with its code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:59:00">[52:59:00]</a>. When metamodern ideas are run on a lower stage of cognitive complexity, they can be "flattened," leading to pathologies and perversions of the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:23:00">[55:23:00]</a>. Examples include misinterpreting "growth hierarchies" to justify moral privileges for "higher stage" individuals, or advocating for military coups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:04:00">[56:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:30:00">[56:30:00]</a>.

Despite these dangers, it's crucial to continue developing and applying these theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:48:00">[57:48:00]</a>. The approach to implementation might be a "Wizard of Oz" strategy: working behind the scenes to affect "knowledge generation trajectories" and institutions, rather than popularizing the concept directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. This could be an "open conspiracy" since the goals are ethical (deepening democracy, aligning goals, fulfilling the promise of the [[Historical Context Premodernity to Modernity | Enlightenment]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>. The focus is on aligning human agency in a complex weave of relations towards a shared common goal, including changing the informational architecture of internet society and political structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.

## [[Relevance of spirituality and altered states in metamodernism | Spirituality]] and Metamodernism
[[Relevance of spirituality and altered states in metamodernism | Spirituality]] is considered important because, in some sense, religions "got something right" that [[meaning crisis and modernism | modern society]] forgot: the potential for profound inner experiences of wholeness, love, and connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. These "higher subjective states" can lead to new conclusions about reality and are crucial for human [[Historical philosophical shifts and their impact on meaning and agency | agency]] and meaning-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

Metamodernism embraces these [[Relevance of spirituality and altered states in metamodernism | spiritual]] insights while rejecting literal interpretations of religious texts (e.g., Jesus walking on water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. It acknowledges that [[Relevance of spirituality and altered states in metamodernism | spiritual]] experiences, even if physiologically explicable (e.g., brain rhythms and confabulation), offer profound depth and can be useful tools for personal growth and breaking mental circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.

Metamodernism seeks a balance between two "sins":
*   **Essentialism:** Ascribing inherent depth onto a surface (e.g., believing angels are real because one saw them in a [[Relevance of spirituality and altered states in metamodernism | spiritual]] experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:36">[01:20:36]</a>.
*   **Reductionism:** Explaining away the "sparkles of reality" by reducing everything to mechanics, leading to a "disenchanted" feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>.

The ideal is to integrate "crude reductionism" and "trembling [[Relevance of spirituality and altered states in metamodernism | spirituality]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:54">[01:29:54]</a>. This means acknowledging the reality of [[Relevance of spirituality and altered states in metamodernism | spiritual]] experiences and their value, without conflating them with objective scientific knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>. The goal is to have "inner depths matched by complexity" and to live a "life of faith" in a moral project larger than oneself, while remaining critically minded and able to question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17">[01:28:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>.

## Key Groups in Metamodernism
The "yoga bourgeoisie," often found in Silicon Valley or core European cities, are identified as a core population of metamodernists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:36">[01:32:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:39">[01:33:39]</a>. These individuals have typically achieved modernist success, then sought [[Relevance of spirituality and altered states in metamodernism | spiritual]] or therapeutic paths after realizing they were still unhappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:08">[01:33:08]</a>. They possess financial, business, and emotional capital, valuing [[Relevance of spirituality and altered states in metamodernism | spirituality]] and seeking to use their lives for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:20">[01:33:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:27">[01:33:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:09">[01:36:09]</a>.

However, this group often lacks "cultural capital" or a proper "map" like the metamodern code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:20">[01:36:20]</a>. They tend to be too limited in their perspective, needing a more "revolutionary faith" and a sociological understanding of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>. The goal is to mobilize and radicalize this class to consciously change society's structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

Lawrence Gonzalez's book, *Surviving Survival*, delves into the aftermath of extreme events, exploring the process of recovery and [[resilience and surviving traumatic events | reinvention]] for those who have lived through traumatic experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This work complements his earlier book, *Deep Survival*, which examines the factors contributing to immediate [[stories_of_survival_and_decisionmaking | survival]] in perilous situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## The Journey of Surviving Survival
Initially, Gonzalez conceived of [[stories_of_survival_and_decisionmaking | survival]] as an event that concludes upon rescue or self-rescue, after which life returns to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:32">[01:30:32]</a>. However, through further interactions with survivors, he realized that living through an extreme event is profoundly life-changing; one cannot simply return to their old life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>. This insight led to *Surviving Survival*, a guide to [[resilience and surviving traumatic events | resilience]] and the necessary process of reinventing one's life after trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>. Survivors often find themselves asking, "Who am I now?" and "What can I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>.

> "Surviving one of these kinds of events that I described in the book is a life-changing thing. You can't go back to your regular life. It won't happen. So you have embarked on a new journey which is the journey to reinvent your life essentially" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:55">[01:30:55]</a>.

The book addresses the ongoing challenges survivors face, such as [[resilience and surviving traumatic events | PTSD]], anxiety, sleep disturbances, and relationship difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:47">[01:31:47]</a>. It helps individuals navigate the transition to a new existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:57">[01:31:57]</a>.

### Core Elements of Resilience
The broader [[concepts_from_deep_survival | concepts from Deep Survival]] also contribute to understanding [[resilience and surviving traumatic events | resilience]] both during and after a crisis:

#### Staying Calm ("Coolness")
A foundational lesson in [[stories_of_survival_and_decisionmaking | survival]] is to remain calm and avoid panic, especially since emotions can be thought of as "hot cognition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>. Maintaining calmness is crucial for clear thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. This "coolness" can be actively cultivated by focusing on deliberate, step-by-step, goal-oriented activities, which helps to reorganize thoughts and reduce emotional overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

#### Balancing Emotion and Reason
[[cognitive_neuroscience_and_survival | Modern neuroscience]] highlights emotion and reason as two primary modes of brain function, operating like a seesaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. While strong fear can impair clear thinking, concentrating on rational thought can temper emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:53">[01:31:53]</a>. Emotion, or "gut feeling," is not merely an impediment; it provides essential guidance, preventing analysis paralysis by narrowing down choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>. The unconscious mind constantly processes information, influencing our rational selves and guiding actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.

However, emotions can sometimes lead to poor decisions, as seen in cases where deep emotional responses override logical thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. The key is to practice striking a balance between emotion and reason throughout life, enabling reliable responses in emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>.

#### Optimism and Locus of Control
An optimistic outlook, even in the face of adversity, can positively impact the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:11">[01:33:11]</a>. This relates to the concept of [[resilience and surviving traumatic events | locus of control]]: individuals with an internal locus of control view the world as something they can influence and improve, rather than being mere victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:07">[01:34:07]</a>. For such individuals, "adversity equals opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>.

#### Positive Mental Attitude (PMA)
[[resilience and surviving traumatic events | Positive Mental Attitude]], a term often used by the military, is central to [[stories_of_survival_and_decisionmaking | survival]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>. It encompasses humor, optimism, and calmness, allowing individuals to function better under duress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:38">[01:23:38]</a>.

#### The Role of Humor
Humor, especially dark humor, serves as a vital coping mechanism for those in dangerous professions, such as firefighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>. It helps detoxify potentially poisonous experiences, reduces stress, and allows for the regaining of functional ability, helping to prevent conditions like [[resilience and surviving traumatic events | PTSD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:18">[01:32:18]</a>.

#### Helping Others
In an emergency, helping someone else can fundamentally shift one's mindset from victim to rescuer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. This act of assistance provides a sense of control and fosters a positive, optimistic attitude, which aids in [[resilience and surviving traumatic events | survival]] and even boosts the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>. For example, doctors and nurses often fare better in critical situations due to their ingrained drive to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:29">[01:34:29]</a>. Survivors often find superhuman strength when motivated by the desire to live for loved ones, such as a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>.

#### Practice and Preparation
To be effective in an emergency, one must practice desired behaviors in daily life, as high-stress situations cause individuals to revert to ingrained habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. A survivor "builds up an account of commitment over a lifetime," which serves them when trouble arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>. This includes cultivating habits like perceiving and believing the reality of a situation, rather than clinging to how things *should* be or *were* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:54">[01:22:54]</a>.

#### Humility
Regardless of expertise or credentials, humility is paramount in dangerous environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:30">[01:50:30]</a>. Overconfidence, like that of "Rambo types," can be lethal, as shown by the Army Ranger who drowned because he refused help in whitewater rapids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Experts can make fatal errors when they become complacent or fall into tunnel vision, often relying on past successes ("we always do it this way") which can be disastrous in novel conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:59">[01:51:59]</a>. Knowing when to turn back from a dangerous situation, or acknowledging that nature does not adjust to one's skill level, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:39">[01:52:39]</a>.

### Relevance to Current Times
The principles of [[resilience and surviving traumatic events | surviving survival]] are particularly relevant during a global pandemic, as many will emerge from the experience realizing their old lives have irrevocably changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:03">[01:32:03]</a>. The [[emergence and complexity | current crisis]] can be seen as a "normal accident" within a complex system, where widespread illness is a natural outcome of human interaction and modern travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>. Individuals exhibiting [[resilience and surviving traumatic events | positive mental attitude]] during such times embrace activities that provide purpose and maintain an optimistic outlook, while those struggling feel overwhelmed and helpless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>. This period serves as an opportunity for people to reconsider their consumption habits and recognize the fragility of modern civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a>.

Mystical experiences are profound, often transformative states of consciousness that can arise through various means, including psychedelics, ritual processes, or specific physical and mental conditions such as tiredness, food deprivation, or being in certain natural settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>.

## Nature and Impact of Mystical Experiences

From a [[Neuroscience consciousness and nontraditional religious experiences | cognitive continuum]] perspective, mystical experiences can be understood as an advanced form of insight. They range from localized "aha!" moments to sustained states of "flow" where an individual's expertise is fully engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. At their peak, these experiences represent a flow state applied to "meta-optimal gripping," which refers to an enhanced ability to adapt and evolve one's own understanding and engagement with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>.

When these experiences occur, individuals often report a profound sense of inner peace and a feeling of coming into relationship with "what's more real"—a deeper engagement with reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. Research indicates that such experiences can have a significant and positive impact, prompting individuals to:
*   Undergo personal transformation and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>.
*   Reawaken and remember the [[Distinctions Between Meaning Mystery and Sacredness | being mode]] of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>.
*   Be lifted out of [[Distinctions Between Meaning Mystery and Sacredness | modal confusion]] (the error of trying to meet [[Distinctions Between Meaning Mystery and Sacredness | being needs]] with a "having mode" approach) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>.
*   Transform their lives in ways that are objectively noticeable and measurable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>.

## Rational Justification

Given a broader understanding of [[Relating complexity science to broader philosophical questions | rationality]]—defined as a systematic and reliable way of overcoming self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>—mystical experiences, when they become "awakening experiences," can be rationally advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>. They reliably and systemically help individuals overcome self-deception, such as [[Distinctions Between Meaning Mystery and Sacredness | modal confusion]], and cultivate wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.

### Wisdom vs. Knowledge

It is crucial to distinguish between wisdom, which often results from these experiences, and mere knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. When individuals emerge from mystical states, their subsequent metaphysical pronouncements should not be given extra privilege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>. The Buddha himself famously warned his followers against metaphysical speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a> and discouraged claims of performing miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. Such attempts to translate spiritual transformation ([[Distinctions Between Meaning Mystery and Sacredness | being mode]]) into special powers of manipulating the world ([[Distinctions Between Meaning Mystery and Sacredness | having mode]]) represent profound [[Distinctions Between Meaning Mystery and Sacredness | modal confusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.

## Societal and Philosophical Context

Societies that have heavily invested in mystical experiences, such as historical Tibet and Vietnam, have not necessarily yielded desirable societal outcomes, often characterized by feudal structures and significant suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:23">[01:24:23]</a>. This highlights the danger of [[Distinctions Between Meaning Mystery and Sacredness | societal modal confusion]], particularly when a society prioritizes spiritual practices (the "monastery") without the critical inquiry and knowledge acquisition fostered by institutions like the "university" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>. The optimal approach involves pursuing both the cultivation of wisdom and the acquisition of knowledge in an [[Relating complexity science to broader philosophical questions | opponent-processing]] fashion, where they mutually constrain and correct each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:15">[01:26:15]</a>.

Building comprehensive [[Self and Reality in Metaphysical Studies | metaphysics]] solely from the mystery of consciousness or quantum mechanics is viewed with skepticism, as these are often attempts by "babbling idiots" to generate grand theories from incomplete understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:32">[01:38:32]</a>. There should be intellectual humility in discussing consciousness, as no single theory has yet definitively solved its complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:36">[01:37:36]</a>. The goal is to "thicken up" the functional explanation of consciousness to the point where the ontological question of its nature becomes more answerable, akin to how biological understanding has clarified the "mystery" of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>.

Mystical experiences, when properly understood and integrated into an [[Neuroscience consciousness and nontraditional religious experiences | ecology of practices]], can function as powerful [[Neuroscience consciousness and nontraditional religious experiences | psychotechnologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>. These practices, which include [[Neuroscience consciousness and nontraditional religious experiences | meditation]], [[Neuroscience consciousness and nontraditional religious experiences | contemplation]], movement practices, and ethical practices, collectively enhance one's "meta-optimal grip" on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This allows for greater adaptability, overcoming self-deception, and navigating the complexities of reality effectively.

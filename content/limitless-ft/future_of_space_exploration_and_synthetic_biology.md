The "Limitless" podcast aims to guide listeners through the rapidly evolving landscape of [[breakthrough_technologies_reshaping_the_world | breakthrough technologies]] that are poised to fundamentally alter the world as we know it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The show explores [[frontier_technologies_and_their_impact_on_the_future | frontiers of technology]] across various industries, including energy, robotics, engineering, manufacturing, AI, synthetic biology, space exploration, and rocket ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Exploring New Frontiers

Limitless seeks to be a comprehensive exploration of technology in every industry, covering a wide range of subjects:
*   [[advancements_in_energy_and_robotics | Energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   [[advancements_in_energy_and_robotics | Robotics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   Manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   [[the_future_of_ai_hardware | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Synthetic Biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   [[investing_in_space_exploration_and_its_implications_for_humanity | Space Exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Rocket Ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

The show's hosts believe that what currently feels like fundamental constraints on humanity will transform into opportunities in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Their mission is to explore these opportunities and illuminate an "infinitely expanding horizon" to help listeners prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## The Next Revolution

While the "world of bits" (digital technology) has seen aggressive acceleration, the "world of atoms" (physical technology) has not kept pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, this trend is shifting, and the hosts describe the current period as "day zero of this next revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. With the emergence of a new AI world order, there is significant potential energy for creating novel things that genuinely resemble the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The podcast is excited to embark on this journey, exploring how dramatically different human lives are soon to become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The landscape of search engines is undergoing significant transformation with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_major_tech_companies_like_apple_and_google | Major tech companies like Apple and Google]] are at the forefront of this shift, with AI poised to redefine how users interact with search.

## Apple's Potential AI Search Product

[[apple_ai_search_product_rumors | Apple is rumored to be developing its own AI search product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, which could potentially challenge Google's dominance in the search market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Currently, when users type a search query into the address bar of Safari on Apple devices, it defaults to Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Apple pays Google approximately $19 billion per year for this default search engine privilege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

However, recent statements from Apple executives indicate a potential change. Apple exec Eddie Q stated that [[ai_search_tools_versus_google | AI search tools]] like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity offer a superior search experience compared to Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. There is exploration into revamping search, which could lead to Google being replaced as the default option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Google's Adaptation to AI Search

Even Google, traditionally the leader in search, has begun to integrate AI into its services. When a search is performed on Google, it now displays an AI summary at the top of the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This demonstrates Google's own reliance on AI to enhance its search capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Market Impact

The speculation surrounding Apple's potential entry into AI search has had a significant [[impact_of_ai_on_google_market_cap | impact on Google's market capitalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As user habits shift towards AI-powered search tools, the traditional search model faces considerable disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

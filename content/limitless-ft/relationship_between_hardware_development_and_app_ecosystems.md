There is a strong belief that [[hardware_and_software_revolutions | hardware revolutions]] consistently precede software revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This relationship is almost definitional, with foundational hardware advancements serving as the necessary precursors for widespread software innovations and the creation of app ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Precedence of Hardware

For a significant software ecosystem like the App Store to emerge, enabling major companies such as Uber, the underlying hardware—specifically the iPhone—was a prerequisite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The development of the iPhone itself relied on specific hardware companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom, alongside over two decades of advancements in network and communications technology, largely at the hardware level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Similar patterns are observed in other technological shifts:
*   **Deep Learning** The advent of deep learning required the development and progress of the GPU over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_hardware_in_the_evolution_of_cloud_computing | Cloud Computing]]** The very concept of [[role_of_hardware_in_the_evolution_of_cloud_computing | cloud computing]] is rooted in the availability of very cheap [[history_and_impact_of_commodity_hardware_on_distributed_systems | commodity hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The core idea involves deploying large quantities of inexpensive [[history_and_impact_of_commodity_hardware_on_distributed_systems | commodity hardware]] in a centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. On top of this, [[history_and_impact_of_commodity_hardware_on_distributed_systems | distributed systems]] use algorithms to manage failures and hardware breakdowns in a fault-tolerant manner, providing a significant cost advantage over maintaining proprietary hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This infrastructure was built upon more than two decades of advancements in memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

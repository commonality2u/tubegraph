For a period of approximately 30 to 40 years, space exploration experienced [[stagnation_in_space_progress_over_30_to_40_years | limited progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This long period of stagnation often gives people a skewed perspective when a field begins to undergo [[exponential_progress_in_space_technology | exponential progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Stagnation in Space Costs
The cost per kilogram to orbit remained largely unchanged for about 30 years, hovering around $100,000 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This consistent high cost was a significant barrier to widespread space access and development.

## Dramatic Reductions and Increases
SpaceX aims to drastically reduce the cost per kilogram to orbit with its fully reusable Starship, potentially bringing it down to approximately $20 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents a 50,000x reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

In addition to cost reduction, the amount of cargo that can be sent to space is set to increase dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Within 10 years, it's projected that humanity will be able to send up a million times more material per year than was possible 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, marking an unprecedented [[increase_in_the_amount_of_cargo_sent_to_space | increase in the amount of cargo sent to space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Railroad Analogy
The combined impact of a 50,000x cost reduction and a million-fold [[increase_in_the_amount_of_cargo_sent_to_space | increase in cargo capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> is compared to the early railroad era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Before railroads, crossing America by horsedrawn carriage was dangerous, with a high risk of death or disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The advent of railroads transformed this, allowing for the comfortable, easy, and cheap transport of extremely large amounts of goods across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

This transformation is likened to the current shift in space travel, moving from an era of "horsedrawn carriages to space" to one of "railroad to space," where space becomes vastly more accessible and affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Space exploration is on the cusp of a dramatic increase in the amount of cargo that can be transported to orbit annually, a shift comparable in scale to the advent of the railroad era. This surge follows a period of significant [[stagnation_in_space_progress_over_30_to_40_years | stagnation in space progress]] over several decades, which has created a misleading intuition about the field's potential for [[exponential_progress_in_space_technology | exponential progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Cost Reduction

For approximately 30 to 40 years, space travel saw little advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The cost per kilogram to orbit remained largely static for around 30 years, hovering at roughly $100,000 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, [[SpaceXs impact on reducing the cost of launching to orbit | SpaceX's Starship]], once fully reusable, is projected to reduce this cost to about $20 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents an astonishing 50,000x reduction in the cost of launching to orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Projected Cargo Volume Increase

Beyond the significant cost reduction, the capacity to send material into space is also experiencing an unprecedented increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Historically, the amount of cargo that could be placed in space was highly limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Within the next 10 years, it is anticipated that humanity will be able to put up to a million times more material per year into space than was possible 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This dual advancement—a 50,000x decrease in cost and a million-fold increase in send-up capacity—marks a transformative moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The "Railroad to Space" Era

The magnitude of this change is so profound that very few historical parallels exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The most appropriate [[comparison_of_space_advancements_to_the_railroad_era | analogy]] is the early railroad era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Just as railroads transformed travel from dangerous, horse-drawn carriage journeys across America to comfortable, affordable, and high-volume transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, space is undergoing a similar revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The current period is transitioning from a "horse-drawn carriage to space" phase to a "railroad to space" era, enabling vastly greater and cheaper access to orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

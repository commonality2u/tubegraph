The development of artificial intelligence (AI) presents several potential future outcomes, with varying degrees of government involvement and control over [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI resources]].

## Potential Futures for AI and Governance

Three general outcomes for [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] development are currently envisioned:

1.  **Post-Scarcity Utopia**
    In this optimistic scenario, [[impact_of_ai_on_job_replacement_and_human_labor | AI models replace jobs]] and human work, creating value for everyone and removing the necessity for humans to work for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This would lead to a "post-scarcity" world where basic needs are met, and individuals are free to pursue other endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

2.  **Corporate Feudalism**
    A dystopian, yet "all alive" vision suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) could replace all human work, but these LLMs would be owned by a small number of companies, leading to a new form of [[corporate_control_and_feudalism_in_ai_development | feudalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In this outcome, powerful companies controlling LLMs would effectively govern large parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    Governments would likely become "tightly coupled" with these entities, potentially nationalizing the [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This scenario would create a significant divide between those with access to [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] resources and those without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

3.  **Extinction Event**
    The third outcome involves the creation of misaligned [[ai_and_technological_advancements | intelligence]], such as misaligned Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence, which could lead to the demise of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Prominent figures like Sam Altman and Elon Musk estimate the probability of such a "misaligned superintelligence" event, or other negative consequences leading to humanity's end, at approximately 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

The [[intelligence_curse_and_agi | intelligence curse]] is an analogy to the *resource curse*, which describes a set of incentives found in economies that are reliant on natural resources rather than human labor for their wealth generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The resource curse is a well-documented phenomenon in development economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Defining the Resource Curse

The resource curse is succinctly defined as the tendency for countries with abundant natural resources to experience worse conditions for their citizens, rather than leading to widespread wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Mechanisms of the Curse
One prominent explanation for the resource curse is the shift in incentives for powerful actors:
*   **Reduced Need for Human Labor** If a state's wealth is primarily derived from easily extractable resources like oil, its incentive shifts away from building a complex, diversified economy that relies on its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Generating wealth from resources requires significantly fewer people than a developed economy like the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Loss of Economic Incentive to Invest in People** Governments in such "rentier states" no longer need to invest heavily in public goods like education or infrastructure to increase human productivity and tax revenue, because their primary income source is the resource itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Historically, investments in education, infrastructure, reliable governance, and competitive markets were incentives for states to ensure their population's productivity for taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. This is seen as a utilitarian motive, rather than pure altruism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.
*   **Social and Political Outcomes** Without the economic need for a productive populace, resource-rich nations often suffer from poverty, corruption, and inequality, especially if they lack strong institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. Leaders or oligarchs control the resource rents, while regular people receive little benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

### Examples of the Resource Curse
*   **Afflicted States** Examples include oil-rich countries in the Middle East, which may not have developed civil liberties or diverse labor economies, or Russia, which is described as being in the grip of authoritarian powers and having devolved into a plutocracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The Democratic Republic of Congo, with trillions of dollars in minerals, sees its people subsist on only a few dollars a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>. Nigeria is another example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

*   **Counter-Examples (Breaking the Curse)** Some countries have managed to avoid the negative effects of the resource curse, primarily due to strong existing institutions:
    *   **Norway** discovered oil when it already possessed an efficient, anti-corrupt, and robust democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. Its voting incentives overrode raw capital incentives, and its bureaucracy could manage the wealth distribution effectively, ensuring benefits were dispersed among voters who hold real power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
    *   **Oman** managed to break the curse due to a credible threat of an uprising or revolution, which incentivized the state to share resource rents to maintain social stability and avoid unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

## Connection to the [[intelligence_curse_and_agi | Intelligence Curse]]

The core idea of the [[intelligence_curse_and_agi | intelligence curse]] is that the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), defined as the ability to automate most or all human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, could create a similar incentive structure to the resource curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Parallel Incentive Shifts
Just as natural resources can sever the economic incentive for powerful actors to care about their regular population, AGI could do the same by replacing human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This means the traditional economic exchange of goods and benefits that historically tied powerful actors to the well-being of "regular people" (everyone who doesn't have capital and depends on economic contribution) could disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

If AI can replace human labor for valuable economic tasks, then nation states and corporations might no longer have a strong incentive to invest in or care for their human populations, as their economic engine would shift to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This could lead to a situation where [[Corporate control and AI led feudalism | capital accrues tremendous power]] and can be substituted for labor more effectively than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, potentially eroding [[AI augmented humans and job displacement | social mobility]] and individual power. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>

The analogy suggests that without strong, proactively built democratic institutions and widespread diffusion of AI benefits, societies could face similar outcomes to those afflicted by the resource curse, even amidst potential abundance from AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>.

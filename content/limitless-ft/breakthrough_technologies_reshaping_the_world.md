## Introduction to Limitless

Limitless is a program dedicated to exploring the [[frontier_technologies_and_their_impact_on_the_future | breakthrough technologies]] that are actively reshaping the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The show serves as a guide to understanding the [[frontier_technologies_and_their_impact_on the_future | frontiers of technology]] that are expected to rapidly change the world as we know it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Each Monday, Limitless features interviews with founders, builders, and investors who are instrumental in shaping future developments, aiming to help listeners critically think about and make sense of the evolving future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A weekly roundtable discussion is also hosted every Thursday, focusing on the rapid progress within the [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_major_tech_companies_like_apple_and_google | AI]] space and its broad impact on society and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Exploring the Frontiers of Technology

Limitless extends the curiosity of Bankless, venturing into new frontiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It offers a comprehensive exploration of [[frontier_technologies_and_their_impact_on_the_future | technology]] across various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### A Comprehensive Approach

The show covers a wide range of subjects, including:
*   [[advancements_in_energy_and_robotics | Energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   [[advancements_in_energy_and_robotics | Robotics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   Manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_major_tech_companies_like_apple_and_google | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   [[future_of_space_exploration_and_synthetic_biology | Synthetic biology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   [[future_of_space_exploration_and_synthetic_biology | Space exploration]] and rocket ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

The philosophy behind Limitless is that knowledge expands fractally along the frontiers of what is believed to be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. What might seem like [[new_technological_opportunities_and_constraints | fundamental constraints]] on humanity today are anticipated to become tomorrow's [[new_technological_opportunities_and_constraints | opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The show aims to explore these [[new_technological_opportunities_and_constraints | opportunities]] and illuminate an "infinitely expanding horizon" to help prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## The Shifting Landscape: From Bits to Atoms

Historically, the [[the_potential_acceleration_of_technological_adoption | world of bits]] (software) has accelerated aggressively, while the world of atoms (hardware and physical technologies) has not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, this trend is changing, and the current moment is considered "day zero" of a new revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. With the emergence of a new [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_major_tech_companies_like_apple_and_google | AI]] world order, there is significant "potential [[energy_breakthroughs_and_the_future_of_sustainable_power | energy]]" for creating new things that truly resemble the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Looking Ahead

Limitless intends to share this journey of discovery, offering a firsthand look at how drastically different lives are expected to become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. To join this exploration, listeners are encouraged to subscribe to the Limitless podcast on their preferred platform and on YouTube, and to leave five-star reviews to help spread education about these [[frontier_technologies_and_their_impact_on_the_future | frontier technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

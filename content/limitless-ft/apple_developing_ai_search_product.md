Apple is reportedly developing its own [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI search product]], signaling a potential challenge to [[apples_potential_shift_away_from_google_as_default_search_engine | Google]]'s long-standing dominance in the search engine market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This move aligns with [[apples_strategy_in_adapting_to_ai_advancements | Apple's strategy in adapting to AI advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Current Relationship with Google

Currently, when users open the Safari browser on an Apple laptop or mobile device and type a search query into the address bar, it defaults to using [[apples_potential_shift_away_from_google_as_default_search_engine | Google]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Apple pays [[apples_payments_to_google_for_search_default | Google]] a significant sum of $19 billion per year for this privilege of having [[apples_payments_to_google_for_search_default | Google]] automatically set as the default search engine in that bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Shift Towards AI Search

Apple executives are publicly acknowledging the superiority of [[comparison_of_ai_search_tools_and_google | AI search tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Specifically, Apple exec Eddie Q has stated that [[comparison_of_ai_search_tools_and_google | AI search]] via tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity is significantly better than traditional [[comparison_of_ai_search_tools_and_google | Google]] search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

There's a noticeable shift in user habits, with individuals transferring their search behavior away from [[comparison_of_ai_search_tools_and_google | Google]] towards these [[comparison_of_ai_search_tools_and_google | AI search tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Even [[comparison_of_ai_search_tools_and_google | Google]] itself now incorporates AI summaries at the top of its search results pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Apple is actively exploring revamping its search capabilities, which could lead to replacing [[apples_potential_shift_away_from_google_as_default_search_engine | Google]] as the default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Potential Implications

The anticipation of Apple launching its own [[market_impact_of_apples_ai_search_on_google | AI search product]] has already had a significant impact on [[market_impact_of_apples_ai_search_on_google | Google]]'s market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

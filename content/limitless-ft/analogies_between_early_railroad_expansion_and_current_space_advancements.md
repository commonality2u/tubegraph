Space progress remained largely stagnant for approximately 30 to 40 years, leading to a skewed intuition about its potential for exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This period of [[stagnation_in_space_progress_over_the_past_30_to_40_years | stagnation in space progress]] significantly influenced public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Historical Cost and Capacity Constraints in Space

For about 30 years, the cost per kilogram to orbit remained stalled at around $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Additionally, the amount of material that could be sent into space was severely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## SpaceX's Transformative Impact

[[SpaceXs impact on lowering space travel costs with Starship | SpaceX]], with its fully reusable Starship, is projected to reduce the cost per kilogram to orbit to as low as $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents an extraordinary 50,000-fold reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Beyond cost reduction, [[increased_capacity_for_sending_materials_to_space | SpaceX]] is set to dramatically increase capacity. Within 10 years, it's anticipated that a million times more material per year will be able to be sent into space compared to 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Railroad Analogy for Space

The current advancements in space, characterized by a 50,000x decrease in cost and a million-fold increase in sendable material, are likened to the early railroad era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Transformation in Transportation

This comparison draws parallels with the transition from horse-drawn carriages to railroads for transcontinental travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Historically, traveling across America by horse-drawn carriage carried significant risks, including death or severe disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The advent of railroads revolutionized this, enabling the easy, comfortable, and cheap transportation of extremely large quantities of goods across the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that this transformation is analogous to what is currently happening in space: moving from "horse-drawn carriages to space" to "railroad space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

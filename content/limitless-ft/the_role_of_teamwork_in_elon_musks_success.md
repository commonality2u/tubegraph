While [[elon_musks_personal_development | Elon Musk]]'s individual journey is often highlighted as the product of decades of "pain, suffering, work compounding," an underappreciated aspect of his current effectiveness is the exceptional team he has assembled around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Assembling a Collective of Talent

Over the past 20 to 30 years, [[elon_musks_personal_development | Elon Musk]] has built a collective of approximately 20 individuals who are considered "some of the most talented humans on the planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Finding such individuals is rare, with only a few encountered each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Investment in Team Development

Developing this caliber of team is not a quick process; it can take a decade of "testing someone" to truly understand their potential and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This long-term investment contributes to the effectiveness of the team. This process highlights [[the_time_required_to_develop_talented_teams | the time required to develop talented teams]].

## Examples of Key Individuals

Across his ventures, [[elon_musks_personal_development | Elon Musk]]'s companies each feature around five exceptionally talented individuals. [[examples_of_talented_individuals_in_musks_companies | Specific examples]] include Mark Josa at [[spacexs_impact_on_lowering_space_travel_costs_with_starship | SpaceX]] and Steve Davis at Boring Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Team Synergy and Efficiency

These key team members exhibit a remarkable "mind meld" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. They understand how to work together so effectively that they often do not need to verbalize tasks, instinctively knowing what needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Building such an "organism" that is self-sustaining and maximally effective takes approximately 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

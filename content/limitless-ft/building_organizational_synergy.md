Achieving profound organizational synergy, exemplified by figures like [[elon_musks_influential_superteam | Elon Musk]], is not an overnight process but rather the result of decades of strategic effort and [[longterm_collaboration_and_effectiveness | work compounding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. A significant factor in his present-day effectiveness is the assembly of an elite group of around 20 individuals over the past 20 to 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

## The Importance of a Talented Team

This collective consists of some of the most [[the_importance_of_a_talented_team | talented humans]] on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Such individuals are rare, with only a couple potentially encountered each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. Recognizing their true potential and reliability often requires a decade of testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

Examples of these highly talented individuals within Musk's organizations include:
*   Mark Josa at SpaceX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>
*   Steve Davis at Boring Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>

Typically, each of his companies features about five such exceptionally gifted people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>.

## Cultivating a "Mind Meld"

A critical element of this synergy is the "mind meld" shared among these team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>. They understand how to work together so seamlessly that explicit communication becomes unnecessary for tasks to be accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Long-Term Investment in Synergy

The development of such a highly effective organizational "organism" cannot be rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It takes approximately 20 years to build a self-sustaining and maximally evolved system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

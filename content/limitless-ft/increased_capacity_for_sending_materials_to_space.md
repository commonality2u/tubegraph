Space exploration experienced a period of [[stagnation in space progress over the past 30 to 40 years | limited progress]] for approximately 30 to 40 years, which has historically influenced public perception and intuition about its potential for exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. During this period, the cost per kilogram to orbit remained largely stalled at around $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Exponential Growth in Space Access

A significant shift is underway, largely driven by [[spacexs_impact_on_lowering_space_travel_costs_with_starship | SpaceX]] and its Starship vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. When fully reusable, Starship is projected to reduce the cost per kilogram to orbit down to approximately $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This represents an unprecedented [[cost_reduction_in_launching_payloads_to_orbit | 50,000x reduction in cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Beyond just the [[cost_reduction_in_launching_payloads_to_orbit | cost reduction]], this advancement dramatically increases the amount of material that can be transported to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Historically, the capacity for sending objects into space has been very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Within the next decade, it is anticipated that the annual capacity for sending materials to space will be a million times greater than what was possible 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Analogies to Historical Transformations

The combined effect of a 50,000x [[cost_reduction_in_launching_payloads_to_orbit | cost reduction]] and a millionfold increase in capacity for sending materials to space is analogous to the most transformative periods in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A fitting comparison can be made to the [[analogies_between_early_railroad_expansion_and_current_space_advancements | early railroad era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Before railroads, crossing America by horse-drawn carriage was a hazardous journey with a high risk of death or disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The advent of railroads made it possible to transport extremely large amounts of goods across the continent easily, comfortably, and cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This current shift in space access is described as transitioning from a "horse-drawn carriage to space" era to a "railroad to space" era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

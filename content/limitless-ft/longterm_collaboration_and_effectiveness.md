Elon Musk's current effectiveness is significantly attributed to his ability to assemble a highly [[the_importance_of_a_talented_team | talented team]] over two to three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This collective comprises approximately 20 individuals who are considered among the most talented humans globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Cultivating a High-Performing Team

Finding individuals of such caliber is a rare occurrence, with only a couple potentially identified each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Furthermore, it requires about a decade of testing and observation to truly understand their potential and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Examples include Mark Josa at SpaceX and Steve Davis at The Boring Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Each of Musk's companies typically features around five exceptionally [[the_importance_of_a_talented_team | talented]] individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Organizational Synergy

These key team members develop a "mind meld," enabling them to work together seamlessly, often without needing verbal communication to understand what needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This level of [[building_organizational_synergy | organizational synergy]] cannot be rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It takes approximately 20 years to build such an effective, self-sustaining "organism" that is maximally evolved for productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

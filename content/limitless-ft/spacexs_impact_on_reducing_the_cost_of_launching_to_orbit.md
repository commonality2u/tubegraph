## Historical Context: Stagnation in Space Launch Costs
For approximately 30 to 40 years, space exploration experienced [[stagnation_in_space_progress_over_30_to_40_years | limited progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prolonged period of stagnation has given people an incorrect intuition about the potential for [[exponential_progress_in_space_technology | exponential progress]] in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Specifically, the cost per kilogram to orbit remained largely unchanged for about 30 years, hovering around $100,000 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## SpaceX's Cost Reduction and Capacity Increase
SpaceX is poised to dramatically reduce the cost of launching to orbit with its Starship vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Once Starship is fully reusable, the cost per kilogram is projected to drop to approximately $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This represents an unprecedented 50,000x reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

In addition to cost reduction, SpaceX's advancements will significantly increase the [[increase_in_the_amount_of_cargo_sent_to_space | amount of cargo]] that can be sent to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Historically, the volume of material that could be launched was very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Within the next 10 years, the annual capacity to launch materials into space is expected to be a million times greater than it was 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The combined impact of a 50,000x cost reduction and a million-fold increase in launch capacity is transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The "Railroad to Space" Analogy
The only comparable historical analogy for such a profound shift is the [[comparison_of_space_advancements_to_the_railroad_era | early railroad era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Prior to railroads, crossing America by horse-drawn carriage was dangerous, with a high risk of death or disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Railroads revolutionized this, allowing very large amounts of goods to be transported cheaply, easily, and comfortably across the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

This mirrors the current shift in space travel, moving from a "horse-drawn carriage to space" era to a "railroad to space" era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are rapidly transforming the landscape of scientific discovery and personalized medicine, with major tech companies leading the charge in developing models capable of generating new knowledge and proposing novel treatments.

## Accelerating Scientific Discovery

Leading AI labs are developing advanced coding agents that not only write efficient code but also contribute to fundamental scientific breakthroughs.

### Google's Alpha Evolve
Google's Alpha Evolve is a pipeline of models designed to improve algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Efficiency Gains** Alpha Evolve was able to improve the efficiency of Google's own model by 1%, resulting in $150 million in cost savings for training and inferencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. It also redesigned a chip for efficiency gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.
*   **Novel Knowledge Generation** More significantly, Alpha Evolve was presented with 50 open math challenges that had not been solved by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
    *   In 75% of cases, it rediscovered the best known solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
    *   In 20% of cases (approximately 15 problems), it improved upon previously best-known solutions, yielding new discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. This indicates that AI is capable of creating "net new knowledge," particularly in foundational areas like mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

This ability of AI to improve itself and accelerate discovery is seen as a significant step towards superintelligence, pushing the limits of human knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## Advancements in Personalized Medicine and Cures

AI is increasingly being applied to natural sciences, leading to potential breakthroughs in personalized medicine and cures.

### Meta's Scientific Discoveries
Meta (formerly Facebook) released four scientific papers demonstrating how AI can make new discoveries in areas such as molecular structure, atom structure, and sampling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. This focus extends beyond digital applications to real-world impacts, particularly in healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

### The Robin Agent and Blindness Treatment
A notable breakthrough involves a new AI agent named Robin. This agent was tasked with finding a scientific experiment that could lead to a cure for blindness caused by AMD (Age-related Macular Degeneration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.
*   Robin proposed an experiment, which was then precisely executed by human researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
*   Through a collaborative process over six iterations, Robin developed a novel idea: using a rock inhibitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.
*   This compound was previously only approved in Japan for a completely different associated disease, with no prior scientific research linking it to blindness treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.
*   When tested, the rock inhibitor successfully cured blindness in mice models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

This human-AI collaboration exemplifies a "centaur" model, similar to chess where human-computer teams outperform either humans or computers alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Such rapid progress suggests a future where AI significantly shortens the timeline for developing cures and treatments for various ailments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.

### Broader Implications for Health and Longevity
The development of AI in medicine suggests that staying alive for the next 10 years might enable individuals to live for a century or more, as AI is predicted to offer cures for any ailment by then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. This aligns with ongoing efforts in longevity research, where AI is expected to provide significant breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.

## Ethical and Societal Considerations
The rapid advancements in AI's ability to generate new knowledge and impact human life raise significant concerns. The concept of AI recursively self-improving poses potential risks, leading to discussions about "P Doom" (probability of doom) scenarios among [[AI as a therapeutic tool | AI safety]] experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. The duality of AI's capabilities, to cure diseases or create harmful agents, highlights the importance of [[impact of AI on society and culture | AI alignment]] with human values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

For a significant period, approximately 30 to 40 years, space exploration did not see much progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This stalled period can lead to poor intuition when a field subsequently enters a phase of [[exponential_progress_in_space_technology | exponential progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Stalled Period

The cost per kilogram to orbit remained largely stagnant for about 30 years, hovering around $100,000 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Transformative Shift

This stagnation is being dramatically overcome by new advancements, particularly from [[SpaceXs impact on reducing the cost of launching to orbit | SpaceX]]. With Starship, once it becomes fully reusable, the cost per kilogram to orbit is projected to drop to approximately $20 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents an astounding 50,000x reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Beyond cost, the sheer volume of material that can be sent to space is also experiencing a monumental increase. The amount of cargo able to be placed into space was previously very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, within a decade, it is anticipated that a million times more material per year will be launched into space compared to 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This signifies a massive [[increase_in_the_amount_of_cargo_sent_to_space | increase in the amount of cargo sent to space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Analogies to Historical Progress

The combination of a 50,000x reduction in cost and a million-fold increase in payload capacity is so profound that the only fitting historical analogies are found in the [[comparison_of_space_advancements_to_the_railroad_era | early railroad era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This period saw a transition from dangerous horse-drawn carriage journeys across America, where there was a high risk of death or disease, to the ability to transport extremely large amounts of goods very cheaply and comfortably by train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This mirrors the current shift in space, moving from "horse-drawn carriages to space" to effectively having a "railroad to space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

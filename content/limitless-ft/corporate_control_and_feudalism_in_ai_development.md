One potential outcome of the advancement of [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] is a dystopian future characterized by corporate control and a new form of feudalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Feudalism Scenario

In this vision, Large Language Models (LLMs) and other [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] systems become capable of replacing all human work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, instead of leading to widespread prosperity, these powerful [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] resources are exclusively owned by a small group of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

This concentration of ownership ushers in a new era of feudalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Similar to Japan before its opening, the world could be divided into powerful "sects" controlled by these [[implications_of_ai_on_startups_and_tech_monopolies | companies]] that possess all-powerful LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. These entities would control large segments of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Government Involvement and Societal Divide

[[involvement_of_governments_in_ai_regulation_and_nationalization | Governments]] would likely be closely intertwined with these powerful [[implications_of_ai_on_startups_and_tech_monopolies | companies]], potentially even nationalizing their [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This scenario would create a profound [[impact_of_ai_on_society_and_culture | societal divide]] where not everyone has equal access to [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] resources, leading to a stark separation between those who do and those who do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Apple is reportedly poised to challenge Google's dominance in the search engine market by launching its own [[apple_developing_ai_search_product | AI search product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This move is seen as Apple "coming for Google's throne" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Current Search Landscape

Currently, the Safari browser on Apple devices uses Google as its default search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Apple pays Google approximately $19 billion per year for this default integration in the search bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Rise of AI in Search

Apple exec Eddie Q has stated that [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] search tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity offer a superior experience compared to Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Personal user habits are also shifting, with some users transferring their search practices away from Google to [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Even Google itself has begun integrating [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]], displaying an [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] summary at the top of its search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Implications for Google

Apple is exploring a "revamping search" strategy, which could lead to [[apples_potential_shift_away_from_google_as_default_search_engine | Apple's potential shift away from Google as default search engine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This potential change has already had a significant negative [[market_impact_of_apples_ai_search_on_google | effect on Google's market cap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

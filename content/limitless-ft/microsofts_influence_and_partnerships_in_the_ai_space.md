Microsoft has established a significant presence in the [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI space]], holding considerable influence and forming key partnerships, particularly with OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The company is perceived as "owning pretty much the entire stack of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> and has its "fingers in all of these different things and these weird partnerships and deals and like org structures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:58">[01:56:58]</a>.

## Strategic Investments and Profit Sharing with OpenAI

Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI is a cornerstone of its [[implications_of_ai_on_startups_and_tech_monopolies | AI strategy]].
*   **Investment:** Microsoft invested upwards of $20 billion into OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>.
*   **Compute Infrastructure:** An additional $19 billion was invested by Microsoft to provide the GPU and CPU infrastructure required for OpenAI's model inference and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>. Microsoft Azure, their main cloud service, is OpenAI's exclusive cloud for frontier model training and inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:03">[02:40:03]</a>. This reliance creates high switching costs, keeping Microsoft central for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:03">[02:40:03]</a>.
*   **Profit Share:** Microsoft receives a 49% profit share from all services OpenAI charges for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:25">[02:25:25]</a>. This arrangement includes any products OpenAI acquires and integrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:34">[02:30:34]</a>. Initially, Microsoft received 75% of profits until $13 billion of its total investment was recouped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. After that, it reduced to 49% until OpenAI reaches $92 billion in profit, at which point the special profit agreement ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Model Access:** Microsoft gains access to OpenAI's model weights, specifically GPT-40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>. This access is seen as a crucial aspect of Microsoft's "moat" in the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>.

While Microsoft is a major financial backer, it does not have overall board control of OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:03">[02:49:03]</a>. This dynamic gives OpenAI significant leverage, particularly as it seeks to reduce Microsoft's profit share in preparation for a potential public offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Despite the financial gains for Microsoft (e.g., potentially turning $19 billion into $178 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, some argue that OpenAI, possessing the core IP, models, and talent, remains the ultimate winner in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## Ownership in the Coding Stack

Microsoft has a strong presence in the AI coding stack:
*   **GitHub:** Microsoft owns GitHub, a platform with 100 million users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:04">[02:06:04]</a>.
*   **VS Code:** Microsoft owns VS Code, an integrated development environment (IDE) that commanded 74% of the market share in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>.
*   **Windsurf and Cursor:** OpenAI's acquisition of Windsurf and its investment in Cursor, both of which were "forked" from VS Code, extends Microsoft's influence through its partnership with OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. These companies facilitate software app development using AI prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Internal AI Offerings and Competition

Microsoft's own AI offering, Copilot, directly competes with OpenAI's products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. However, Copilot itself is based on OpenAI's GPT-40 and GPT-4 Mini models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. This creates an "incestual" and "messy conflicting thing" where Microsoft's investment in OpenAI leads to internal competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

Despite its significant financial and infrastructural contributions, the long-term permanence of Microsoft's stronghold is questioned. The reliance on OpenAI's model weights and developer stickiness to VS Code ecosystems might not be permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>.

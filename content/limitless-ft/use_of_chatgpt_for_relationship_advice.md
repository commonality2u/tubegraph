Individuals are increasingly engaging with ChatGPT for deeply personal discussions, including seeking [[chatgpt_as_a_tool_for_personal_therapy | relationship advice]] and [[chatgpt_as_a_tool_for_personal_therapy | therapy for childhood issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These interactions are often highly personal and contextual to the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Applications Beyond Traditional Work Tasks

While some might expect AI to be used for straightforward tasks like document design, many users leverage ChatGPT for nuanced interpersonal situations. For instance, people use it to strategize [[handling_workplace_conflicts_with_chatgpt | how to politely address workplace conflicts]] with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Social Perceptions

Engaging in such personal conversations with an AI, described as a "weird social genie in a bottle," is considered outside conventional [[social_etiquette_and_talking_to_ai | social etiquette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Unlike sharing accepted social content like photos of food, discussing personal afflictions with an AI is perceived as unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Creating a Safe Space for Difficult Conversations

Despite the social stigma, ChatGPT proves useful for opening up about subjects that are otherwise difficult to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It functions as a [[chatgpt_as_a_safe_space_for_men_to_discuss_difficult_topics | safe space]], particularly for men, who may find it easier to articulate challenging issues to a robot than to another human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This provides an outlet for topics one wishes to discuss but lacks the opportunity, context, or person to do so with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This utility has even been suggested as a means to address the male loneliness epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The advent of [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] models presents three potential outcomes concerning [[ais_impact_on_labor_and_employment | job replacement]] and the future of human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These range from a utopian post-scarcity society to a dystopian future of technological feudalism, or even an existential threat.

## Utopian Scenario: Post-Scarcity Society
In an optimistic outlook, [[ais_impact_on_labor_and_employment | AI models]] are envisioned to replace a significant portion of current jobs and human work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This replacement would generate immense value for everyone, potentially eliminating the necessity for human beings to work for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This scenario would mark a shift towards a [[utopian_future_of_ai_and_postscarcity_society | post-scarcity world]], where the constant struggle for existence is removed, allowing individuals to pursue activities of their own choosing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Dystopian Scenario: Feudalism and AI Monopoly
A more pessimistic, yet "we're all alive" vision suggests that while Large Language Models (LLMs) could replace all human work, these powerful LLMs might be controlled by a small number of corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This concentration of power could lead to a new form of feudalism, reminiscent of historical Japan before its opening, where large corporate "sects" control significant parts of the world through their ownership of LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. In this scenario, governments would likely be tightly coupled with these entities, possibly nationalizing their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A stark divide would emerge between those with access to these powerful [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI resources]] and those without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Catastrophic Scenario: Misaligned Superintelligence
The most dire potential outcome involves the creation of a misaligned intelligence, such as a misaligned AGI or superintelligence, that for various reasons could lead to the extinction of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Prominent figures like Sam Altman and Elon Musk estimate the probability of such a "misaligned superintelligence" or other negative consequences leading to the end of humanity to be around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This would represent the ultimate [[impact_of_ai_on_society_and_culture | impact of AI]], where all human labor and existence cease.

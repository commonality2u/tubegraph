The ongoing competition among tech giants, likened to a "real-world Game of Thrones," is seeing significant shifts, particularly in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and search [00:01:07]. A major recent development involves Apple and its potential move away from Google as the default search engine on its devices [00:00:41], which caused Google to lose almost $200 billion in market value within two hours of the news breaking [00:00:47].

## The Current Arrangement

Currently, when users open the Safari browser on an Apple device, Google is set as the default search engine [00:03:06]. For this privilege, Apple receives an annual payment of $19 billion from Google [00:03:17]. This arrangement is a significant deal, as Apple holds the largest distribution for Google searches, with approximately 2.35 billion active devices pre-installed with Safari [00:04:42]. Safari alone accounts for about 18% of all global web browsing activity, and a substantial 30% in the USA [00:05:04].

## The Catalyst for Change: Apple's AI Ambitions

Rumors suggest that Apple is considering launching its own [[apple_developing_ai_search_product | AI search product]] [00:02:57], potentially revamping its search capabilities and replacing Google [00:04:06]. Apple executives, such as Eddie Q, have indicated that [[comparison_of_ai_search_tools_and_google | AI search tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity are superior to Google]] [00:03:35]. This sentiment is echoed by some users who have already shifted their search habits away from Google [00:03:54]. Notably, even Google has begun incorporating AI summaries at the top of its search results [00:04:01].

### Market Impact
The mere suggestion of Apple's potential shift had a dramatic impact on Google's market capitalization, wiping out $200 billion (approximately 10% of its total value) in just two hours [00:04:16].

### Implications for Google
If Apple were to switch its default search, Google could lose billions of search queries daily [00:05:00]. This change could result in Google losing nearly a third of its browsing activity and around $50 billion in gross ad sales [00:05:15]. Such a move could be implemented by Apple through a single software upgrade [00:05:32]. Search revenue constitutes about 56% of Google's total revenue, though this percentage is expected to decline as AI becomes more prevalent [00:07:19].

## Apple's AI Strategy and Challenges

Despite the market's reaction, there's a perceived struggle within Apple regarding its [[apples_strategy_in_adapting_to_ai_advancements | AI strategy and execution abilities]] [00:05:55]. Critics note that Apple has yet to roll out significant AI products [00:06:35]. The market's strong reaction to the news might be an overreaction, given Apple's current AI limitations [00:06:27].

### Contrasting Strengths: Apple vs. Google
Apple's strength lies in its excellent hardware products, but it struggles to develop the necessary software to fully utilize AI [00:06:55]. Conversely, Google possesses incredible AI software, such as the Gemini models, but has a poor track record of creating user-friendly consumer products [00:07:00]. This dynamic means they inadvertently "harm each other" [00:07:10].

### The Cost of AI Search
A significant challenge for AI search is its higher cost per query compared to traditional search [00:07:31]. Generating a single token in AI is an order of magnitude more expensive than a simple Google search query [00:07:46]. An average AI query requires hundreds to thousands of tokens, making AI search at least ten times more expensive than Google's indexed search [00:07:54]. This high cost poses a hurdle for AI to support the massive volume of search queries [00:07:44].

### Google's Product Development Challenges
Google has historically struggled with consumer product innovation, as seen with past failures like its social network "Circles" [00:09:05]. While Google is integrating Gemini into its smart devices like TVs and watches, it faces the challenge of widespread adoption beyond Android phones [00:09:16]. Despite inventing the Transformer architecture (the foundation for modern AI models) years before OpenAI, Google has consistently failed to create compelling consumer products from its advanced technology [00:09:40].

## The Future of AI and Device-Level Moats

The discussion raises questions about the future of AI and whether a new generation of companies or devices will emerge to solve the integration problems faced by Apple and Google [00:11:19]. The distribution power of Apple at the device level is a significant moat [00:05:50], implying that control over hardware could be a critical advantage in the AI era. This aligns with the idea that the "moat is at the device level for now" [00:05:52]. Some suggest that new mediums or devices might be needed to onboard users to AI, especially given that many people outside tech circles are not yet using AI tools like ChatGPT [00:12:01].

The integration of AI directly into hardware could lead to more accessible and intuitive user experiences, reminiscent of how the [[development_of_the_iphone_and_enabling_the_app_store | iPhone enabled the app store]] and transformed mobile computing [00:37:17]. The ongoing race for control over AI, particularly at the hardware and foundational model level, is seen as a high-stakes "Game of Thrones" [00:01:48], with giants like Apple and Google vying for control of this new form of intelligence [00:01:57].

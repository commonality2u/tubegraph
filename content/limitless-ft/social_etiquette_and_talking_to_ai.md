The increasing use of AI, particularly ChatGPT, has led to people engaging with it for deeply personal and contextual conversations, challenging traditional social etiquette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This contrasts with commonly accepted online behaviors, such as posting a picture of an ice cream cone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Personal Applications of ChatGPT

Many individuals are utilizing ChatGPT as a conversational partner for sensitive topics, including:
*   [[use_of_chatgpt_for_relationship_advice | Relationship advice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
*   Therapy for childhood issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Guidance on [[handling_workplace_conflicts_with_chatgpt | workplace conflicts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For instance, people seek advice on how to politely address a colleague who might be "encroaching" on their territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## AI as a "Social Genie"

Engaging in personal afflictions with a "weird social genie in a bottle" like ChatGPT is considered "kind of weird" when compared to more accepted social media activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Addressing Difficult Conversations

AI serves as a useful tool for discussing subjects that are otherwise hard to open up about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It provides a "safe space" to talk about difficult things, especially for men, who may find it easier to articulate challenging thoughts to a robot than to another human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This access to a non-judgmental conversational partner can be particularly beneficial when individuals lack the opportunity or person to confide in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Some suggest this utility could help address the "male loneliness epidemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

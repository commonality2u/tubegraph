One optimistic vision for the future of [[ai_and_the_future_of_employment | AI]] suggests a "happy case" scenario where artificial intelligence models replace a significant portion of current human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Optimistic Outcome: Post-Scarcity

In this ideal outcome, [[ai_and_the_future_of_employment | AI]] models would not only replace jobs and work but also generate value for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This widespread creation of value would eliminate the necessity for human beings to work simply to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

This paradigm shift could lead humanity into a post-scarcity world, where the constant struggle for basic survival is no longer a primary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. In such a society, individuals would be free to exist without the imperative to work, with their subsequent choices and activities being entirely their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

This vision implies significant [[economic_and_social_impacts_of_ai | economic and social impacts]] leading to a world of abundance, contrasting with more dystopian outlooks where [[ai_and_the_future_of_employment | AI]] could lead to new forms of feudalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, or even existential risks from misaligned superintelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

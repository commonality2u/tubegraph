The belief that [[Hardware revolutions preceding software revolutions | hardware revolutions precede software revolutions]] is a fundamental principle in technological advancement [00:00:05].

## Hardware as the Foundation for Software Innovation

Significant software innovations, such as the App Store that enabled companies like Uber, are contingent upon foundational hardware developments [00:00:16]. For the App Store to exist, the iPhone was necessary [00:00:16]. In turn, the development of the iPhone relied heavily on contributions from companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom [00:00:20]. This underscores a period of over 20 years dedicated to building out networks and communications technology, predominantly at the hardware level [00:00:26].

## Broader Examples of Hardware-Driven Progress

This pattern of hardware preceding software extends to other areas:

*   **Deep Learning** The emergence of deep learning was made possible by approximately 20 years of progress in GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) technology [00:00:30].
*   **Cloud Computing** The concept of cloud computing, which involves leveraging cheap commodity hardware in a centralized location with distributed systems, also necessitated over two decades of advancements in memory and CPUs [00:01:04]. These systems utilize algorithms atop commodity hardware to manage failures and provide a significant cost advantage over self-hosting hardware [00:00:58].

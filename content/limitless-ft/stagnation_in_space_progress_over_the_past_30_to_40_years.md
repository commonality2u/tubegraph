Space progress experienced a significant period of stagnation for approximately 30 to 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prolonged stall can lead to an inaccurate intuition when the field begins to undergo exponential progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Historical Stagnation

For about 30 years, the cost per kilogram to orbit remained largely unchanged, hovering around $100,000 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This persistent cost barrier contributed to the limited [[increased_capacity_for_sending_materials_to_space | amount of stuff]] that could be sent into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Breaking the Barrier

A dramatic shift is anticipated in [[cost_reduction_in_launching_payloads_to_orbit | cost reduction]] and [[increased_capacity_for_sending_materials_to_space | capacity]]. [[spacexs_impact_on_lowering_space_travel_costs_with_starship | SpaceX]], with its fully reusable [[spacexs_impact_on_lowering_space_travel_costs_with_starship | Starship]], is projected to reduce the cost per kilogram to orbit to around $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents an extraordinary 50,000x reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Beyond cost, the [[increased_capacity_for_sending_materials_to_space | volume of material]] able to be transported to space is also set for a massive increase. Within ten years, it's expected that a million times more material will be able to be sent into space annually compared to two decades prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Analogies to Historical Transformation

The combination of a 50,000x [[cost_reduction_in_launching_payloads_to_orbit | cost reduction]] and a million-fold increase in [[increased_capacity_for_sending_materials_to_space | transport capacity]] is likened to the [[analogies_between_early_railroad_expansion_and_current_space_advancements | early railroad era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This historical comparison illustrates a shift from difficult and risky horse-drawn carriage travel across America—where there was a high chance of death or disease—to the ease, comfort, and affordability of sending vast quantities of goods via rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The impending changes in space travel are described as the creation of "railroad to space," transforming from "horsedrawn carriages to space" to "railroad space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

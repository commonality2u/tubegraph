For approximately 30 to 40 years, space progress was largely stalled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, particularly concerning the cost per kilogram to orbit, which remained at roughly $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This [[stagnation_in_space_progress_over_the_past_30_to_40_years | stalled period]] can create misleading intuitions when a field begins exponential progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## SpaceX's Impact

[[spacexs_impact_on_lowering_space_travel_costs_with_starship | SpaceX's Starship]], once fully reusable, is projected to reduce the cost per kilogram to orbit to around $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This represents a 50,000-fold reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Increased Capacity

Beyond just cost, the capacity for sending materials to space is also dramatically increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In the past, the amount of material that could be launched was very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Within 10 years, it's anticipated that a million times more material per year will be able to be launched into space compared to 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This combination of a 50,000x cost reduction and a million-fold [[increased_capacity_for_sending_materials_to_space | increase in payload volume]] signifies a monumental shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Historical Analogy

These advancements are comparable to the [[analogies_between_early_railroad_expansion_and_current_space_advancements | early railroad era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Previously, crossing America by horse-drawn carriage was dangerous, with high risks of death or disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The advent of railroads made it possible to transport extremely large quantities of goods cheaply and easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This shift mirrors the current transition from "horse-drawn carriages to space" to "railroad to space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

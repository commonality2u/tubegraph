## Philosophy of Progress

Limitless operates on the principle that knowledge expands along the [[Frontier technologies and their implications | frontiers]] of what is believed possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. What are perceived as fundamental constraints on humanity today are seen as potential [[future opportunities from current constraints | opportunities]] for tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The show's mission is to explore these opportunities and illuminate an "infinitely expanding horizon" to help prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## The Next Revolution

While the "world of bits" has rapidly accelerated, the "world of atoms" has historically lagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, this trend is shifting, and we are considered to be at "day zero of this next revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. With the emergence of a new [[AI and technological advancements | AI world order]], there is significant potential energy for creating novel innovations that truly embody the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> "Suddenly there is a huge amount of potential energy for creating new things, things that actually look and feel like the future."

The show aims to share this journey of discovery, exploring firsthand how dramatically different our lives are poised to become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

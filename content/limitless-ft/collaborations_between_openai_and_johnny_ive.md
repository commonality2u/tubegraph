OpenAI has embarked on a significant collaboration with renowned industrial designer Johnny Ive, involving a $6.5 billion deal to design the future of [[AI and technological advancements | AI hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This partnership aims to create devices that re-imagine interaction with [[AI and technological advancements | AI]], potentially signalling the "death of the phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:58">[01:56:58]</a> and traditional computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Johnny Ive's Background and Return

Johnny Ive is celebrated for his design work at Apple, where he led the design of the first iPod and iPhone, as well as many other iconic Apple devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. He left Apple in 2019 and remained out of the public eye for six years, pondering his next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. His company, LoveFrom, which includes former Apple design team members (the "IO team"), has been acquired by OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This super team of industrial designers, who have created successful consumer devices, is now focused on OpenAI's hardware vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

## The Vision for AI Hardware

The collaboration aims to create a device that represents what the iPhone would look like if it were made in a world where [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] came first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This new product is envisioned as a "third core device" alongside phones and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. The goal is to move users away from screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, offering an "ambient [[AI and technological advancements | AI]]" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a> that is unobtrusive, can sit in a pocket or on a desk, and is aware of its user's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### Core Principles and Expectations
*   **Mass Marketability**: Johnny Ive is credited with making smartphones a mass-market product with the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. The partnership seeks to achieve a similar accessibility for [[AI and technological advancements | AI]], bringing it into everyday life beyond current chatbot use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   **Non-distracting Design**: Unlike the "distracting and extractive" nature of current phones, the new device aims to be a "passive device" that complements daily life without a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>.
*   **Sensory Input**: Modern [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] can see, understand, and interact with the real world, unlike computers at the time of the first iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. This suggests an interface built around new inputs and outputs related to the physical environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:15]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Human Experience**: The device is intended to be an extension of the human self, akin to a "second brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. It could provide passive, ambient "surveillance of your life" to help improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>, recalling forgotten details or assisting in real-time situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

## Form Factor and Technology
While OpenAI is keeping the exact form factor a secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, speculation points to a compact, wearable, or portable device. It is expected to be smaller than a phone and capable of fitting in a pocket or being worn around the neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Concepts suggest a "puck-like" or "stone" shape, likely made of brushed aluminum, featuring a protruding camera lens for a wide field of view and side microphones for triangulating audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

It is unlikely to be glasses or AirPods due to current technological limitations, such as battery power, processor size, heat management, and the lack of readily available novel manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The goal is to make a simple device that can be ramped up quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Business Model and Timeline
The collaboration involves a $6.5 billion investment, with $1.5 billion paid in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This equates to approximately $155 million per employee for Ive's 55-person IO team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. OpenAI is heavily marketing the partnership, highlighting the synergy between Sam Altman ([[AI and technological advancements | AI]] creator) and Johnny Ive (hardware designer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

The device is currently in the prototype phase, with Sam Altman reportedly using it for about a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. Early production is planned for Vietnam in 2026, with a target rollout of 100 million devices by 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. The expected price point is around $100-$200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, with a likely subscription model similar to Whoop, where the hardware is a companion to a subscription service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## Implications for the Market

### Competition with Apple
This move by OpenAI and Johnny Ive puts them "toe-to-toe" with Apple, a hardware-first company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. [[Apples strategy in adapting to AI advancements | Apple's strategy in adapting to AI advancements]] has been criticized for being late to the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a> and failing to deliver on AI promises from its developer conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Siri, Apple's voice assistant, has been noted to outsource queries, indicating a struggle with in-house [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. If Apple cannot integrate [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] effectively, particularly in-house, it risks becoming obsolete in the hardware space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

### Comparison to Google
Unlike Google, which maintained its moat through search and then re-emerged strong in [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, Apple's primary moat is its devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. If OpenAI's new device becomes the widely adopted standard, Apple's stronghold could be threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. Google has already introduced an [[market_impact_of_apples_ai_search_on_google | AI mode]] in its search engine, directly competing with platforms like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

### The "Life OS" Ambition
OpenAI's long-term vision extends beyond a single device; they aim to build an entire "suite of devices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a> and become the "life OS," enhancing users' lives from morning to night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This ecosystem approach, potentially involving mobile devices and wall-mounted displays, could create a comprehensive [[AI and technological advancements | AI]]-driven environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. While this could offer benefits like reduced phone addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, concerns about [[AI models and ethical concerns | corporate control]] and increased "brain rot" are also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

The development of this [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] hardware marks a significant step towards a future where [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] is an ever-present, integrated part of daily life, serving as a second brain and potentially transforming human-technology interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

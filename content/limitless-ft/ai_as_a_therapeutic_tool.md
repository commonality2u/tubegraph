[[AI models behaving and making decisions autonomously | AI models]], such as ChatGPT, are being increasingly used for personal and therapeutic purposes, extending beyond typical work-related tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Personal Applications

Many users engage with AI for deeply personal and contextual issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Common applications include:
*   [[relationship_advice_through_ai | Relationship advice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   Therapy for childhood issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

While some find discussing personal afflictions with an AI "kind of weird," it is seen as a useful tool for opening up about subjects that are difficult to discuss otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Professional Conflict Resolution

Beyond personal relationships, AI is also utilized for navigating professional situations, such as seeking advice on how to address workplace conflicts or territorial disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This highlights AI's role in [[ai_in_professional_conflict_resolution | professional conflict resolution]].

## Reasons for AI's Appeal

AI offers a "safe space" for individuals to discuss sensitive topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. For some, particularly men, it is easier to articulate challenging or vulnerable thoughts to a robot than to another human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This utility stems from the ability to speak about difficult subjects when traditional avenues, such as having a suitable person or optionality, are unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

As one perspective suggests, AI could potentially contribute to "solving the male loneliness epidemic" by providing an accessible outlet for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

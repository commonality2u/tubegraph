China is making significant strides in the [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI space]], particularly with new model releases and the development of its own [[the_future_of_ai_hardware_and_its_potential_impact | AI chip]] technology, challenging Western dominance in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

## DeepSeek's AI Models
DeepSeek, a Chinese company, has "shocked the entire Western [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI world]]" by developing models that are significantly cheaper yet as competent as [[ai_and_technological_advancements | OpenAI's]] frontier models, which cost billions to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

### DeepSeek's Next Major Update
DeepSeek is rumored to be releasing a new major model update, which is not yet officially public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>. This model is expected to feature:
*   **Parameters** 1.2 trillion parameters, which, if released today, would be the largest public model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>.
*   **Architecture** A hybrid mixture-of-experts (MoE) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. This architecture improves efficiency by only querying a subset of parameters (e.g., 37 billion) needed for a specific query, rather than the entire set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
*   **Cost Efficiency** It is projected to be 97.3% cheaper than GPT-4o, making it "insane" in terms of cost reduction per query or token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.
*   **Training Data** Trained on 5.2 petabytes of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   **Reasoning** Expected to have a "much better reasoning model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.
*   **Efficiency in AI Chip Utilization** The model shows 82% utilization on the Huawei Ascend 910B, a Chinese-manufactured [[the_future_of_ai_hardware_and_its_potential_impact | AI chip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.

This focus on efficiency, combined with a rapid rate of acceleration, is seen as a potentially powerful trend for DeepSeek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.

## Huawei's AI Chip Development
Huawei is making significant progress in the [[the_future_of_ai_hardware_and_its_potential_impact | AI chip]] manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Nvidia has historically dominated over 95% of this industry, including compute and chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. However, China's Huawei has developed a chip that is "75% as good as Nvidia's flagship or one of their old flagship chips, the H100s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. This represents rapid progress, as this percentage was "much lower just a few months ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

Huawei also launched a 718 billion parameter model, which was trained on 6,000 of their new Ascend chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. This is a significant reduction from the 8,000 chips used to train their previous model, which had half the parameter count, indicating a trend of "chip count down, model intelligence up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

## Implications of China's Advancements
The advancements from companies like DeepSeek and Huawei signify a shift in the global [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] landscape:
*   **Efficiency and Cost Reduction** China's focus on efficiency and cost reduction per query/token can create a "moat" or competitive advantage, especially for startups consuming large amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. This enables "33 times more compute for the same amount of cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>, making [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] much more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>.
*   **Innovation in Design** Unlike previous trends where China primarily made existing technologies cheaper (e.g., mobile phones copying iPhones), these advancements demonstrate "innovating on the design and the execution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>.
*   **Open Sourcing** Chinese manufacturers are currently open-sourcing these models, which benefits the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. However, there's a concern that they might "close the gates" once they achieve parity or betterment in models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.
*   **Global Competition** The rapid progress suggests that the "Game of Thrones" in the [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] space might extend beyond the Western world, with China potentially becoming a dominant player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. These developments in efficiency and lower costs mean that the significantly higher cost of [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI]] queries compared to Google searches might not be true for much longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

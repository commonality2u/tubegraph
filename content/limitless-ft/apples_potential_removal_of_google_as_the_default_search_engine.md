Apple is rumored to be considering the launch of its own [[apple_ai_search_product_rumors | AI search product]], which could lead to the removal of Google as the default search engine on Apple devices. This potential shift has already had a significant [[impact_of_ai_on_google_market_cap | impact on Google's market capitalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Current Agreement and Financial Context
Currently, Google is the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser across all Apple devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Apple reportedly receives $19 billion annually from Google for this privilege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This arrangement provides Google with the largest distribution for its searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Apple has 2.35 billion active devices globally, all pre-installed with Safari and Google as the default search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Safari accounts for about 18% of all web browsing activity, and 30% in the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. If Apple were to switch, Google could lose billions of search queries daily and around $50 billion in gross ad sales annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Apple's Motivation and Recent Developments
Apple execs, including Eddie Q, have suggested that [[ai_search_tools_versus_google | AI search tools]] like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity are superior to Google for search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The company is exploring a revamp of its search function, which could involve replacing Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This potential change caused Google's market cap to drop by nearly $200 billion (about 10% of its total) in just two hours following the rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Apple's AI Execution Concerns
Despite these rumors, there's a recognized struggle within Apple regarding its [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_major_tech_companies_like_apple_and_google | AI execution abilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The market's strong reaction to the news is seen by some as an overreaction, given that Apple has not yet rolled out any significant AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Impact on Google and the Future of Search
Google's search model, particularly the traditional "10 blue links," is seen as gradually becoming obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. While AI adds accelerant to this decline, the shift is ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Search accounts for 56% of Google's revenue, but this percentage is expected to continue to drop as [[future_of_ai_in_search_engines | AI in search engines]] becomes more prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Google has started integrating AI summaries into its search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Challenges for Google
Google has a history of struggling to create successful consumer products, despite having powerful underlying technology like the Gemini models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. They invented the transformer model, which underpins many current AI advancements, but were outpaced by OpenAI in productizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. While Google is rolling out Gemini to smart devices like TVs and watches, widespread adoption outside of Android phones is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Cost of AI Search
A significant factor is the cost per query: generating an AI response is an order of magnitude more expensive than a traditional search query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This is because AI generates new content, whereas traditional search merely indexes and points to existing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This cost constraint currently limits the volume of AI search queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. However, advancements in [[advancements_in_ai_model_development_and_competition_from_chinese_tech_companies | AI model development and competition from Chinese tech companies]] like DeepSeek are rapidly driving down the cost per query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

## Competitive Landscape
The situation highlights a "Game of Thrones" scenario among tech giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Apple excels at hardware and product experience but struggles with AI software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Google has strong AI software capabilities (e.g., Gemini) but struggles with consumer-facing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This creates a dynamic where they are "harming each other" by leveraging their respective strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Some believe new generations of companies or mediums might be needed to integrate AI effectively into daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

The overarching goal for these companies is the development of [[the_future_of_agi_and_its_potential_economic_impact | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]], seen as the "end product" of AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

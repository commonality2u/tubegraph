Apple is reportedly poised to challenge Google's dominance in the search engine market by launching its own [[apple_ai_search_product_rumors | Apple AI search product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This move could significantly alter the landscape of the [[future_of_ai_in_search_engines | future of AI in search engines]].

## The Current Landscape: Apple and Google's Agreement

Currently, when users perform searches through the Safari browser on Apple devices, Google is the default search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This [[apples_default_search_agreement_with_google | Apple's default search agreement with Google]] costs Apple approximately $19 billion per year for Google to automatically be set as the default in the search bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Apple's Stance on AI Search

Apple executive Eddie Cue has stated that AI search tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity, offer a superior experience compared to traditional Google search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Some users are already shifting their search habits away from Google towards these AI-powered alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Even Google itself has begun incorporating AI summaries at the top of its search results pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Potential Market Impact

Apple is reportedly exploring a revamp of its search capabilities, which could lead to [[apples_potential_removal_of_google_as_the_default_search_engine | Google being replaced]] as the default search provider on Apple devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The mere speculation of this development has already had a significant [[impact_of_ai_on_google_market_cap | effect on Google's market cap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

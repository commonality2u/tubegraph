Artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, is increasingly being used for personal communication, addressing a range of intimate and complex issues that extend beyond typical work-related tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### AI as a Personal Confidante

Many individuals engage with AI for deeply personal matters, including [[relationship_advice_through_ai | relationship advice]], therapy for childhood issues, and navigating difficult interpersonal dynamics at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For example, users might ask AI for advice on how to politely address a colleague who is perceived as encroaching on their work territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These conversations are often highly personal and contextual to the individual's specific situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

While sharing simple information online, like a picture of an ice cream cone, is widely accepted as part of [[social_etiquette_in_ai_interactions | social etiquette]], discussing personal afflictions with an AI can still be perceived as "weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Addressing Difficult Topics

Despite any social perceptions, AI proves useful for initiating conversations about subjects that are otherwise challenging to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This is particularly true for men, who may find it easier to articulate difficult issues to a robot than to another human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### The 'Safe Space' of AI

AI platforms offer a "safe space" for individuals to discuss sensitive topics that they might be on the verge of addressing but lack the opportunity, context, or appropriate person to talk with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. In this regard, some suggest that AI is contributing to a solution for the male loneliness epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

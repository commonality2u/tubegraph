## Current Arrangement

Apple's Safari browser, used on Apple laptops and mobile devices, currently utilizes Google as its default search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This means that when a user types a search query into the address bar, it defaults to Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. For this privilege, Apple pays Google an annual fee of $19 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Potential Shift to AI Search

There are rumors that Apple is [[apple_developing_ai_search_product | launching their own AI search product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Apple executives, such as Eddie Q, have stated that [[comparison_of_ai_search_tools_and_google | AI search tools]] like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity are superior to Google's search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Even Google itself incorporates AI summaries at the top of its search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Apple is reportedly exploring a revamp of its search capabilities, which could lead to [[apples_potential_shift_away_from_google_as_default_search_engine | replacing Google]] as the default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Market Implications

The potential for Apple to replace Google as its default search engine has had a [[market_impact_of_apples_ai_search_on_google | significant negative effect on Google's market capitalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

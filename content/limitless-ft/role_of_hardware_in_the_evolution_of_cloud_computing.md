The evolution of cloud computing is fundamentally linked to advancements in hardware. The underlying principle of cloud computing relies on the availability of affordable, readily available hardware components coupled with sophisticated software systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Foundation in Commodity Hardware

A key aspect of cloud computing is the ability to aggregate a large amount of [[history_and_impact_of_commodity_hardware_on_distributed_systems | cheap commodity hardware]] in a centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This approach stands in contrast to the traditional model where organizations would host their own hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## The Role of Distributed Systems

On top of this [[history_and_impact_of_commodity_hardware_on_distributed_systems | commodity hardware]], [[history_and_impact_of_commodity_hardware_on_distributed_systems | distributed systems]] are deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. These systems utilize algorithms to manage and compensate for hardware failures, ensuring fault tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This fault-tolerant design provides a significant cost advantage for cloud users compared to managing their own infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Decades of Hardware Progress

The development of cloud computing required over 20 years of continuous progress in core hardware components, including memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This long-term hardware development is an example of how [[hardware_and_software_revolutions | hardware revolutions]] often precede and enable subsequent software revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Similar to how the iPhone enabled the App Store ecosystem or the [[role_of_gpus_in_deep_learning_advancements | GPU]] enabled [[role_of_gpus_in_deep_learning_advancements | deep learning]], robust and affordable hardware was a prerequisite for the emergence of cloud computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

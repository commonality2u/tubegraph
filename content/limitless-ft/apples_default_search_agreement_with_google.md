Apple currently maintains an agreement with Google, designating Google as the default search engine within its Safari browser on both laptop and mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This means that when a user types a search query into the address bar, Google is automatically used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Financial Details

For the privilege of having Google as the default search engine, Apple pays Google approximately $19 billion per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Potential Shift to AI Search

Recent developments suggest that Apple may be exploring a significant change to this long-standing agreement, potentially replacing Google with its own AI search product or other AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Perceived Superiority of AI Search Tools

Apple executives, including Eddie Q, have indicated that [[ai_search_tools_versus_google|AI search tools versus Google]] like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity are considered "way better than Google" for search queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This perception is influencing a shift in user habits, with some users transferring their search habits away from traditional Google search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Even Google itself has begun integrating AI summaries at the top of its search results pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Apple's Own AI Search Product Rumors

There are rumors that Apple is developing its own [[apple_ai_search_product_rumors|AI search product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

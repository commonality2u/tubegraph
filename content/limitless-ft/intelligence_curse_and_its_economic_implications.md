From: [[limitless-ft]] <br/> 

The **intelligence curse** describes the set of incentives that may emerge with the advent of artificial general intelligence (AGI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. According to OpenAI's definition, AGI is the ability to automate most, if not all, human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This scenario raises concerns that governments, powerful actors, and corporations might lose their incentive to prioritize the well-being of ordinary citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Historically, powerful entities have relied on regular people, fostering an exchange of goods and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Severing this economic link would necessitate a reliance on goodwill, which is considered a less stable arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The concept of the intelligence curse draws parallels with the [[comparison_with_the_resource_curse_and_rentier_states | resource curse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Core Premises of the Intelligence Curse

The thesis of the intelligence curse rests on three main premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>:
1.  **AGI as a transformative force:** AGI is anticipated to accrue incredible capability and power, potentially arriving in the near future (e.g., within five years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
2.  **[[impact_of_ai_on_job_replacement_and_human_labor | AI will replace humans for valuable economic labor]]**: This is a central component of the curse's manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
3.  **Loss of incentive for powerful actors to care for people:** If human labor is replaced, the economic engine previously driven by people diminishes, leading to a decreased incentive for states and companies to maintain social structures, welfare, and civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Pyramid Replacement: The [[ais_impact_on_labor_and_employment | Impact of AI on Labor and Employment]]

The concept of "pyramid replacement" illustrates how [[impact_of_ai_on_job_replacement_and_human_labor | AI will replace humans for valuable economic labor]] within corporate hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### The Mechanism of Automation
Initially, AI is observed to automate tasks with short time horizons, where tasks are completed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Empirically, AI is getting better at these tasks, while longer-time horizon tasks are automated more slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. There is also a social factor where C-suite executives are less likely to lay off themselves or those directly beneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

This process is expected to begin from the bottom up in corporate structures, replacing entry-level employees first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. For instance, in software companies, senior developers might use AI coding tools like Cursor instead of hiring junior interns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The visual representation transitions from a human-filled pyramid to one where AI gradually absorbs lower layers, eventually leaving only a few executives on top before the entire structure becomes an "AI Borg machine" or a "red block" of AI computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This signifies that AI rapidly fills the functions previously performed by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Companies are increasingly adopting an "AI first" approach, as seen with Duolingo, prioritizing automation in every role and contract position to be more efficient and leaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The economic rationale is clear: if a task costs $50,000 for a human but $10,000 in compute, it is hard to justify the human cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

### Human Augmentation vs. Replacement
Currently, AI often acts as a leverage tool, making humans "hyper leveraged" by expanding their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Humans currently hold an advantage in long-horizon tasks and those that require real-world interaction, like CEO roles, which are harder to train AI for due to lack of large datasets or reinforcement learning environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This "augmentation window" could extend for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

However, in the limit, there's no theoretical reason why AI cannot become proficient at long-term planning and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The focus is currently on white-collar "knowledge worker" jobs because LLMs are advancing faster than robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This could lead to a period where humans are valued more for their physical abilities ("hands") than their cognitive ones ("brains") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. If robotics also advance quickly, this could lead to full unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

### Diffusion Barriers
The transition is not expected to be immediate; diffusion barriers exist. Society's institutions, regulations, and structures can slow down the integration of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. However, competitive pressures (e.g., a competitor automating first) and economic downturns (forcing cost-cutting) can accelerate adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## The Shift in Economic Power: Capital Over Labor

The replacement of human labor by [[ai_and_technological_advancements | AI and technological advancements]] means that the power previously held by labor will shift towards capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. In economics, "capital" encompasses money, physical factories, GPUs, energy, and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

Currently, the economy relies heavily on human input, where additional human labor yields significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. However, with AGI, capital can increasingly substitute for labor. For instance, money can be directly converted into results by purchasing AI tokens or API credits from companies like OpenAI, bypassing the need for human talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. This reduces the friction in converting money into real-world results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

### Impact on Social Mobility
A significant concern is the potential erosion of social mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. Traditionally, talented individuals without capital could achieve upward mobility through their work and skills (e.g., the "American dream") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. If capital can fully substitute for labor, the ability to climb the social hierarchy through human talent becomes significantly harder, possibly eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. This could lead to a "permanent caste system" where individuals are largely locked into the capital ledger they are born into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>, reminiscent of pre-Industrial Revolution societies where social mobility was very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

> [!INFO] Industrial Revolution vs. Intelligence Revolution
> The Industrial Revolution, by replacing physical labor with machines, actually benefited humans by freeing up their brains and allowing for the development of complex information economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Our brains are considered our primary advantage as a species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. In contrast, the Intelligence Revolution threatens to replace this cognitive advantage, potentially leading to dramatically lower human wages if AI becomes a total substitute for human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

The ownership of capital in an AI-dominated economy is crucial. While there are calls to ban AI ownership of property or positions like CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>, even if humans own the capital, the concern is how many people would own enough to command many AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

## Erosion of Classical Liberalism and the Social Contract

The intelligence curse poses a threat to classical liberalism and the existing social contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. Post-feudal, post-Enlightenment societies have generally seen improvements in human outcomes, quality of life, wealth, and freedoms due to a belief in humanism and meritocracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

### Incentives for States to Invest in Citizens
Nation-states traditionally invest in their people (e.g., education, infrastructure, reliable governance, competitive markets) because it increases the productivity and taxable income of the population, generating revenue for the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. This is seen not merely as altruism but as an alignment of incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. For example, income taxes represent a significant portion of government revenue in countries like the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>. If human labor becomes less necessary, this economic incentive diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

### The [[comparison_with_the_resource_curse_and_rentier_states | Resource Curse]] as an Analogy
The intelligence curse mirrors the [[comparison_with_the_resource_curse_and_rentier_states | resource curse]], where resource-rich states (often called "rentier states") neglect their citizens because their wealth comes from natural resources rather than taxing human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite trillions in minerals, have populations subsisting on minimal income because leaders gain wealth without needing to invest in the broader populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

> [!INFO] Counter-Examples to the Resource Curse
> *   **Norway:** Discovered oil after establishing robust, anti-corrupt democratic institutions. Voters' power overrode capital incentives, leading to broad distribution of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.
> *   **Oman:** Avoided the curse due to a credible threat of popular uprising or revolution, forcing the state to capitulate and distribute wealth to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

The open question is whether existing democratic institutions can withstand the "tidal wave" of the intelligence curse, which could be even stronger than the resource curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

### Disruption of the Social Contract
The current social contract is based on a delicate balance of power between powerful actors (corporations, nation-states), the people, and the rules (legal systems, constitutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.
*   **Powerful actors need people for value:** People provide labor, which drives economic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
*   **People can displace powerful actors:** Historically, people have overthrown autocratic regimes or influenced governments through voting or credible threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.
*   **Rules constrain powerful actors:** Laws, constitutions, and shared social norms limit the power of institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

The intelligence curse threatens to break this equilibrium. If powerful actors no longer need people for value (due to AI labor), and advanced AI makes it easier for states to surveil and suppress dissent, the people's ability to displace powerful actors diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. This could lead to a situation where powerful actors dictate the rules, and individuals have little bargaining power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

### Potential for Centralization and Authoritarianism
AI has the potential to be both destabilizing and centralizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. Winners of AI disruption could rapidly accumulate power and capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. Historically, dictators were limited by their reliance on human bureaucracy and military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. With AI bureaucracy and military, the constraints on totalitarianism could significantly worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Abundance without Power
> Even if [[future opportunities from current constraints | AI and technological advancements]] lead to immense abundance and wealth, this doesn't guarantee a utopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. If individuals have no real power or stake in the creation of that abundance, their political reality could be severely constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>. China serves as a contemporary example where material conditions have improved for many, yet political freedoms remain limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>. Without material power, people are at the mercy of the political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.

The argument is not that AI will become a self-directed oppressor, but rather that it can drastically expand the power differential between people. Those with existing access to capital can convert it into direct results, leading to an "outlier ability to shape the world," while others' ability to resist diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>.

## Breaking the Intelligence Curse: Avert, Diffuse, Democratize

To navigate the challenges of the intelligence curse and ensure a positive future, a three-pronged approach is proposed: **avert, diffuse, and democratize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

### Avert Catastrophes
The first step is to avert potential catastrophes associated with [[role_of_superintelligence_and_ethical_considerations | AI and technological advancements]], such as bioweapons, cyberattacks, or misaligned AI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. These potential negative outcomes often serve as justifications for powerful centralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. The goal is to build defensive technologies faster than offensive ones (differential technology development) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>. This means developing strong cyber defenses and hardening the world against bioweapons before AI can easily create them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>. Averting these risks without requiring centralizing control is crucial to avoid an attractor basin towards authoritarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>.

### Diffuse AI Benefits
"Diffuse" means ensuring that everyone has access to AI tools and economically benefits from AI as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. This aims to counter the centralizing tendencies of AI by promoting decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.

> [!TIP] Practical Diffusion Strategies
> *   **AI-human augmentation:** Promote tools that enhance human capabilities rather than fully replacing them, extending the "augmentation window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>. Examples include AI coding assistants where the human remains in the driver's seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>.
> *   **User-aligned models:** Develop AI systems trained on individuals' tacit knowledge and data, which can then represent their tastes and judgments in the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>. This ensures users are compensated for the economic activity of "their" AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>.
> *   **Open-source models:** Broadly supported, especially once the world is hardened against major disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

### Democratize Power
"Democratize" focuses on strengthening democratic incentives and structures so that they can override capital incentives when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. This means building technologies that make governance, verification, and coordination easier, leading to more effective and representative democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>. Examples include AI helping policymakers understand voters' opinions, AI advocating on behalf of citizens, or AI systems performing incorruptible audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>.

The overall strategy is to make it so that doing the "safe, good, pro-human thing" is the winning strategy, shifting the equilibrium rather than relying on coordination between competing states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>. This requires aligning incentives and ensuring that leaders of integrity are in power to make critical decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:30">[01:25:30]</a>.

## [[potential_solutions_to_mitigate_the_negative_effects_of_AI | Future Opportunities from Current Constraints]]

If the intelligence curse is successfully averted, the potential payoff is immense. This includes curing diseases, achieving total abundance, unlocking vast resources, and providing experiences previously exclusive to the ultra-elite to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:45">[01:29:45]</a>. The promise of [[impact of AI on society and culture | AI and technological advancements]] is a world where humans have more agency and control with fewer drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

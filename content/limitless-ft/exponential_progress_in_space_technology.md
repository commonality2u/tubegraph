For approximately 30 to 40 years, space exploration experienced [[stagnation_in_space_progress_over_30_to_40_years | little advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This prolonged period of stagnation can create a misleading intuition when the field suddenly begins to undergo exponential progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Dramatic Cost Reduction

The cost per kilogram to orbit was stalled for about 30 years, hovering around $100,000 per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, [[spacexs_impact_on_reducing_the_cost_of_launching_to_orbit | SpaceX]], with its Starship, is projected to reduce this cost significantly to approximately $20 per kilogram once the system is fully reusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents a staggering 50,000x reduction in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Increased Cargo Capacity

Beyond just cost reduction, the amount of cargo that can be sent to space, which was previously very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, is also seeing an exponential increase. Within the next 10 years, the annual capacity to send material into space is expected to be a million times greater than it was 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Historical Analogies

When the cost of access to space drops by 50,000x and the amount of material that can be sent up increases a millionfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, the only comparable historical transformation is the [[comparison_of_space_advancements_to_the_railroad_era | early railroad era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

During the early railroad era, travel across America transitioned from dangerous horse-drawn carriages, where there was a high risk of death or disease, to very easy, comfortable, and cheap transportation of extremely large amounts of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The current developments in space technology are creating a similar paradigm shift, moving from "horse-drawn carriages to space" to effectively establishing a "railroad to space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

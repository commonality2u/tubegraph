The development of advanced software, including deep learning, is fundamentally dependent on prior [[hardware_revolutions_preceding_software_revolutions | hardware revolutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This relationship is considered almost definitional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Hardware as a Prerequisite for Software Revolutions

Major software-driven advancements and companies emerge only after significant hardware breakthroughs have occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Examples illustrating this principle include:
*   **The App Store and Mobile Applications** The ability to create applications like Uber, enabled by the App Store, required the prior existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The iPhone itself depended on decades of hardware development from companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom, alongside 20 years of building communication networks and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Much of this foundational work was at the hardware level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_commodity_hardware_in_cloud_computing | Cloud Computing]]** The emergence of cloud computing relies on the availability of very cheap [[role_of_commodity_hardware_in_cloud_computing | commodity hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The core concept of a cloud involves consolidating inexpensive [[role_of_commodity_hardware_in_cloud_computing | commodity hardware]] in a centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Distributed systems then use algorithms on top of this [[role_of_commodity_hardware_in_cloud_computing | commodity hardware]] to manage failures and hardware breakdowns in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This approach provides a significant cost advantage over hosting individual hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, and it was only possible after over 20 years of progress in memory and CPU technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Enabling Deep Learning

For the field of deep learning to advance and become practical, the development of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) was essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The GPU's capabilities are the result of 20 years of continuous hardware progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Without this foundational hardware, the complex computations required for deep learning models would not be feasible.

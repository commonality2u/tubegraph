The advancement of hardware often precedes revolutions in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key example of this principle in action is the indispensable role of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in enabling deep learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The development of GPUs represents more than two decades of progress that laid the groundwork for modern deep learning capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

This pattern of hardware innovation driving software breakthroughs is also evident in other technological shifts, such as the development of the iPhone preceding the App Store ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, and the evolution of [[role_of_hardware_in_the_evolution_of_cloud_computing | cloud computing]] requiring decades of progress in memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

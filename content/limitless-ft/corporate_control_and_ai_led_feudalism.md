The emergence of advanced [[advancements_in_ai_model_development_and_competition_from_chinese_tech_companies | AI]] models presents several potential societal outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. One dystopian vision involves [[economic_and_social_impacts_of_ai | corporate control]] leading to a new form of feudalism.

## Potential Futures of AI

Broadly, three general outcomes for society in the age of [[impact_of_ai_on_society_and_culture | AI]] are considered:

1.  **Post-Scarcity Society**: In this optimistic scenario, [[ai_and_the_future_of_employment | AI models]] replace a significant portion of human work, generating immense value for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This could eliminate the necessity for human beings to work for survival, ushering in a [[ai_as_a_tool_for_post_scarcity_society | post-scarcity world]] where existence is decoupled from constant labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
2.  **AI-Led Feudalism**: This outcome is characterized by the replacement of all human work by Large Language Models (LLMs), which are then owned by a select few corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
3.  **Misaligned Superintelligence**: A more extreme risk involves the creation of misaligned Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence that could, for various reasons, lead to the demise of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The "pessimistic outcome" (poom) – the risk of misaligned superintelligence or other negative consequences leading to human extinction – is estimated by figures like Sam Altman and Elon Musk to be around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## AI-Led Feudalism (Dystopian Scenario)

This scenario envisions a world where advanced [[ai_and_the_future_of_employment | AI]] systems, particularly LLMs, take over all human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, instead of leading to a [[ai_as_a_tool_for_post_scarcity_society | post-scarcity society]] benefiting all, these powerful LLMs are controlled by a small number of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The result is a society that effectively enters into a form of feudalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This can be likened to historical Japan before its opening, where society was structured into various "sects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. In this future, these "sects" would be companies possessing all-powerful LLMs, controlling significant global territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Governments, while involved, would be tightly integrated with these corporate entities, potentially even nationalizing the LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Crucially, not all individuals would have access to the same [[ai_as_a_tool_for_post_scarcity_society | AI resources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This disparity would create a very strong divide between those who possess and can leverage these [[ai_as_a_tool_for_post_scarcity_society | AI capabilities]] and those who cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

While many individuals utilize AI tools like ChatGPT for common requests such as [[use_of_chatgpt_for_relationship_advice | relationship advice]] or [[chatgpt_as_a_tool_for_personal_therapy | therapy]] for childhood issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, a growing trend involves using it for sensitive workplace matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Use Cases and Nature of Interaction

Instead of asking for document design, users are turning to ChatGPT for deeply personal and contextual advice regarding workplace dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. An example includes seeking guidance on how to politely address a colleague, like "Paul," who is perceived to be encroaching on one's professional territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

These interactions are distinct from typical online sharing, as they venture "outside of [[social_etiquette_and_talking_to_ai | social etiquette]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. While posting a picture of ice cream is socially accepted, discussing personal afflictions with an AI "social genie in a bottle" is considered unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Why People Turn to AI for Workplace Issues

ChatGPT proves "useful for opening up about subjects that are hard to open up about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This is particularly true for men, who may find it "easier to say harder things to a robot than it is to another human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Safe Space for Difficult Conversations
> The AI provides a [[chatgpt_as_a_safe_space_for_men_to_discuss_difficult_topics | safe space]] for individuals to discuss challenging topics they might otherwise keep to themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This occurs when they lack the opportunity, context, or appropriate person to confide in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This use of AI is seen by some as addressing aspects of male loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

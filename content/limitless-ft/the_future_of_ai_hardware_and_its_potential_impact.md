Jony Ive, the renowned designer behind the iPhone and iPod, has partnered with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a $6.5 billion collaboration to design the future of [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This venture aims to create a device that redefines how humans interact with [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI]], potentially signaling the "death of the phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Jony Ive's Return to Design
Jony Ive, famously known as the "grandfather of design," was Apple's lead designer and is credited with pioneering the design for most of Apple's iconic devices, including the first iPod and iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. After stepping away from Apple in 2019, he remained silent for six years, contemplating his next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. His company, LoveFrom, and specifically its IO division, was acquired by OpenAI as part of a $6.5 billion deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This acquisition is seen as OpenAI's most significant to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The collaboration aims to create a range of devices and products that will form the "new bedrock" of [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI]] interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## The Vision for a New AI Device
The new device is imagined as an unobtrusive "third core device" alongside phones and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, capable of sitting in a pocket or on a desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. It is designed to be aware of "everything going on in your life," functioning as a form of "mass surveillance, but just for your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The primary goal is to shift users away from screens, a significant departure from current internet business models reliant on "eyeballs for advertisers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The concept emphasizes "ambient [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, suggesting a device that is always present, leveraging gathered data to enhance daily life without constant active engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. It is envisioned as a "second brain," more efficient and smarter than existing phones, capable of recalling forgotten details or assisting in real-time social situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Form Factor and Functionality
While details are kept secret, rumors, notably from the Wall Street Journal, describe it as a third core device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Experts speculate it won't be glasses or earbuds due to current technological limitations in manufacturing, battery power, and processing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. Instead, it's likely a small, passive, ambient device, possibly a "stone" or "puck-like" object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>, designed to be portable and worn, similar to an [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI]] pendant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. It would incorporate a wide-lens camera and an array of microphones to gather sensory information from the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

The device is currently in the prototype phase, with Sam Altman reportedly using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The plan is for early production in Vietnam by 2026, with a target rollout of 100 million devices in 2027, making it the "fastest device ramp in the history of ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. The business model is anticipated to be a subscription with a low-cost hardware companion, akin to the Whoop model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

## Potential Impact and Challenges
The iPhone, though highly successful, is described as a "distracting and extractive device" that leads to addiction and misinformation due to constant screen time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The new [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI]] hardware aims to provide a more passive, complimentary experience, freeing users from screen reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

The partnership leverages Jony Ive's "Avengers" team, composed of former Apple design studio talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, to set a high standard for [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI]] hardware, avoiding the clunky iterations seen in early virtual reality devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. OpenAI's strong brand and massive user base are expected to drive rapid adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. This first device is part of a broader "suite of devices" aimed at creating a "life OS" ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.

### Competition and Ethical Considerations
This move puts OpenAI "toe-to-toe" with [[apples_strategy_in_adapting_to_ai_advancements|Apple]], a hardware-first company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. [[apples_strategy_in_adapting_to_ai_advancements|Apple]] has faced criticism for its slow [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI]] integration and "leadership problem" in execution, with Siri falling behind and major promised [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI]] features failing to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. If [[apples_strategy_in_adapting_to_ai_advancements|Apple]] cannot address its [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI]] strategy, its dominance in devices could be challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>, especially if OpenAI's device becomes universally adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.

However, the vision of an omnipresent [[ai_and_technological_advancements|AI]] device raises concerns about privacy and a potential "dystopian future" where a single company owns vast amounts of personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. The debate includes whether [[impact_of_ai_on_society_and_culture|AI]] devices will genuinely improve human lives or merely lead to new forms of "brain rotty" engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, potentially coercing users into certain behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>.

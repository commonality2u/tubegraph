For approximately 30 to 40 years, space progress remained largely stagnant, leading to a skewed perception of the field's potential for rapid advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Historically, the [[stagnation_in_space_progress_over_the_past_30_to_40_years | cost per kilogram to orbit]] was stalled at around $100,000 for about three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. SpaceX's Starship is poised to dramatically alter this landscape.

## Drastic Cost Reduction
SpaceX aims to reduce the cost per kilogram to orbit to approximately $20 with a fully reusable Starship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This represents a 50,000x [[cost_reduction_in_launching_payloads_to_orbit | reduction in cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Exponential Increase in Capacity
Beyond the significant [[cost_reduction_in_launching_payloads_to_orbit | cost reduction]], Starship will also revolutionize the [[increased_capacity_for_sending_materials_to_space | amount of material that can be sent to space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While previously limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, it is projected that within 10 years, it will be possible to send a million times more material per year into orbit compared to 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Historical Analogies to Early Railroad Expansion
The combination of a 50,000x cost reduction and a million-fold increase in material capacity leads to profound implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The speaker draws [[analogies_between_early_railroad_expansion_and_current_space_advancements | comparisons]] to the early railroad era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

This transformation is likened to the shift from dangerous, time-consuming horse-drawn carriage travel across America to the ability to easily, comfortably, and cheaply transport vast amounts of goods by train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Essentially, humanity is transitioning from "horse-drawn carriages to space" to "railroad to space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

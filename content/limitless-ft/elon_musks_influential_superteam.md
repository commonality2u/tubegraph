[[elon_musks_personal_development | Elon Musk]]'s current effectiveness is significantly attributed to the "superteam" he has assembled over the past two to three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This collective of approximately 20 individuals are considered among the most [[the_importance_of_a_talented_team | talented]] people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Composition and Dynamics
The process of finding such individuals is rare, with only a couple emerging each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It typically takes a decade of observation and testing to fully understand their true potential and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Each of [[elon_musks_personal_development | Musk]]'s companies, such as [[spacexs_impact_on_reducing_the_cost_of_launching_to_orbit | SpaceX]] and The Boring Company, features about five incredibly [[the_importance_of_a_talented_team | talented]] individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Notable examples include:
*   **Mark Josa** at [[spacexs_impact_on_reducing_the_cost_of_launding_to_orbit | SpaceX]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   **Steve Davis** at Boring Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

These team members are said to have a "mind meld," enabling them to work seamlessly and understand what needs to be done without explicit communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Development and Evolution
Building such a highly effective and self-sustaining "organism" cannot be rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It is a process that literally spans around 20 years to become maximally evolved and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

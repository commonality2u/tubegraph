The principle that [[hardware_revolutions_preceding_software_revolutions | hardware revolutions precede software revolutions]] is a foundational belief in technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is exemplified by the evolution of various technologies: for instance, the App Store, which enabled companies like Uber, required the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The iPhone, in turn, depended on contributions from companies like [[impact_of_qualcomm_and_broadcom_on_technology_advancements | Qualcomm]] and [[impact_of_qualcomm_and_broadcom_on_technology_advancements | Broadcom]], and two decades of developing networks and communications technology, primarily at the hardware level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Similarly, [[importance_of_hardware_in_deep_learning | deep learning]] relies on the [[importance_of_hardware_in_deep_learning | GPU]], representing 20 years of progress in that hardware domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Cloud Computing and Commodity Hardware

Cloud computing itself is a direct outcome of advancements in commodity hardware and the ability to leverage it efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The core concept of cloud computing involves:

*   **Centralized Commodity Hardware:** Gathering a large quantity of inexpensive, readily available commodity hardware in one location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Distributed Systems:** Implementing distributed systems that utilize algorithms on top of this commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** These systems are designed to handle failures and hardware malfunctions in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This approach provides a significant cost advantage over hosting individual hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The development of cloud computing was enabled by over two decades of progress in fundamental hardware components like memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

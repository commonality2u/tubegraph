The speaker strongly believes that hardware revolutions precede software revolutions, considering it almost a definitional point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Case Studies

### Mobile Applications
The advent of the App Store, which enabled the creation of companies like Uber, was dependent on the existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The iPhone itself required underlying hardware advancements from companies such as [[impact_of_qualcomm_and_broadcom_on_technology_advancements | Qualcomm]] and [[impact_of_qualcomm_and_broadcom_on_technology_adva | Broadcom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This entire ecosystem was built upon approximately 20 years of progress in network and communications technology, predominantly at the hardware level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Deep Learning
The development of [[ai_and_technological_advancements | deep learning]] necessitated the creation and widespread availability of the GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This represents another 20 years of hardware progress that paved the way for a software paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing relies on the availability of very cheap [[role_of_commodity_hardware_in_cloud_computing | commodity hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The core concept of cloud computing involves gathering a significant amount of cheap [[role_of_commodity_hardware_in_cloud_computing | commodity hardware]] in one location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Distributed systems then employ algorithms atop this [[role_of_commodity_hardware_in_cloud_computing | commodity hardware]] to manage failures and breakdowns in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This provides a substantial cost advantage compared to hosting one's own hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The foundation for cloud computing was built over 20 years of advancements in memory, CPUs, and related technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

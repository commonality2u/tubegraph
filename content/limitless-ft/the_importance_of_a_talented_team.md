An individual's effectiveness, even that of a prominent figure like Elon Musk, is significantly amplified by the quality of the team they assemble around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While Elon Musk's personal development is the product of decades of work and compounding effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, his present-day efficacy is also heavily reliant on his [[elon_musks_influential_superteam | influential superteam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Assembling a Superteam

Over 20 to 30 years, Elon Musk has gathered a collective of approximately 20 individuals who are considered some of the most talented people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Such individuals are rare, with only a couple potentially encountered each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Each of his companies typically features about five remarkably talented people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

> *   Steve Davis at The Boring Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

## The Value of Long-Term Collaboration

Identifying the true potential and reliability of these key team members is a process that can take a decade of testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This [[longterm_collaboration_and_effectiveness | longterm collaboration and effectiveness]] is crucial, as the most effective teams develop a "mind meld," allowing them to understand what needs to be done without extensive verbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This level of [[building_organizational_synergy | organizational synergy]] cannot be rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It requires approximately 20 years to build what can be described as a self-sustaining and maximally effective organizational "organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

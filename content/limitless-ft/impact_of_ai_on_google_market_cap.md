[[Apple]] is reportedly developing its own [[future_of_ai_in_search_engines | AI search product]], which could challenge [[Google]]'s market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This development has already had a "gnarly effect" on [[Google]]'s market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Current Relationship Between Apple and Google

Currently, when users open the Safari browser on an [[Apple]] laptop or mobile device, [[Google]] is the default search engine in the address bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. [[Apple]] pays [[Google]] $19 billion per year for this privilege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Shift Towards AI Search Tools

[[Apple]] executive Eddie Q has stated that [[ai_search_tools_versus_google | AI search tools]] like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity are significantly better than [[Google]] for search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Some users are already shifting their search habits away from [[Google]] towards these [[ai_search_tools_versus_google | AI-powered alternatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Even [[Google]] itself now uses [[future_of_ai_in_search_engines | AI]] to provide a summary at the top of its search results pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Potential Impact on Google

[[Apple]] is exploring a revamp of its search capabilities, which could lead to replacing [[Google]] as the default search provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This potential move by [[Apple]] is seen as a significant threat to [[Google]]'s position in the search market and has directly impacted its market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

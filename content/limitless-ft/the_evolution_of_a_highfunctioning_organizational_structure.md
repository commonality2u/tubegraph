Building a highly effective and self-sustaining organizational structure is a long-term endeavor that cannot be rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It can take around 20 years to cultivate an "organism" that is maximally evolved and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Assembling a Collective of Talent

A crucial element in creating a high-functioning organization is the strategic assembly of an elite group of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. For example, over a span of 20 to 30 years, Elon Musk has gathered approximately 20 of the most talented humans globally around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Such individuals are rare, with only a couple potentially encountered each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### The Role of Vetting and Time

Identifying and integrating these exceptional individuals requires significant investment in [[the_time_required_to_develop_talented_teams | time]] and rigorous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It can take a decade of observing and testing someone to truly understand their potential and confirm their reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Specific examples of these highly skilled individuals within Musk's organizations include Mark Josa at SpaceX and Steve Davis at Boring Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Each of his companies typically features about five such "out of this world" talented people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Cultivating Seamless Teamwork

The effectiveness of these high-performing teams lies in their ability to operate with profound synergy. These individuals achieve a "mind meld" with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. They possess an intuitive understanding of how to work together and often don't even need verbal communication to know what actions are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This level of [[the_role_of_teamwork_in_elon_musks_success | teamwork]] and cohesion is built over an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

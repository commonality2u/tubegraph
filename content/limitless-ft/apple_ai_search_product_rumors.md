Apple is reportedly poised to launch its own [[future_of_ai_in_search_engines | AI search product]], potentially challenging Google's dominance in the search engine market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This development could represent a significant shift in the competitive landscape for major tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Current Search Engine Agreement

Currently, when users open the Safari browser on Apple devices, the default search engine in the address bar is Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Apple pays Google approximately $19 billion annually for this privilege of having Google automatically set as the default search option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This arrangement is part of [[apples_default_search_agreement_with_google | Apple's default search agreement with Google]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Potential Replacement of Google

The speaker in the podcast has also shifted their search habits away from Google to AI-powered alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

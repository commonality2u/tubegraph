The world of [[AI and technological advancements | AI and technological advancements]] is currently witnessing a "real-world Game of Thrones," with major tech companies battling for dominance in the emerging field of artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Amidst this high-stakes competition, OpenAI, a key player, has recently announced significant leadership changes and shifts in its strategic focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

## New Leadership at OpenAI

OpenAI has expanded its leadership team with the appointment of Fidji Simo as CEO of Applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. This announcement, initially leaked, accelerated the company's timeline for sharing the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

Despite the headlines that sometimes misrepresented her as the overall CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman remains firmly in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. Simo's role is specifically to lead the development of groundbreaking consumer applications for OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

Simo brings extensive experience in building consumer applications, having previously served as CEO at Instacart and as Head of Facebook at Meta for ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. Her background is considered "absolutely stacked" for this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## Strategic Focus: AGI vs. Applications

This leadership expansion signals a clear strategic divide within OpenAI, with two primary races running simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>:

1.  **AGI Research**: Sam Altman will now focus solely on research towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and aligning [[AI and technological advancements | AI models]] for the betterment of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. This has been the most important mission of OpenAI since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
2.  **Consumer Applications**: Fidji Simo's role is to build out the consumer application ecosystem, creating the best possible user experience to attract and retain users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

This dual focus suggests that while AGI remains a long-term goal, OpenAI is also getting very serious about winning the consumer application race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. Sam Altman is focused on building the "engine" (raw intelligence capacity), while Simo is responsible for building the "sports car on top of it" (applications and user experiences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.

### Impact on User Adoption

The move towards consumer applications is crucial, as many individuals outside of tech circles are still not utilizing [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] tools like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. OpenAI's voice feature in ChatGPT has shown potential in increasing user engagement, allowing people to talk about personal issues they might not discuss with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

Sam Altman observed that younger generations (middle school, high school) are using [[AI and technological advancements | AI]] as an "entire life operating system," loading all their thoughts and homework into it and consulting it before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. This trend highlights the potential for an "AI subscription OS plan for your entire life," which OpenAI aims to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.

## OpenAI's Relationship with Microsoft

[[Microsofts influence and partnerships in the AI space | Microsoft's influence and partnerships in the AI space]] plays a significant role in OpenAI's strategy and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

Microsoft made a substantial investment in OpenAI, providing somewhere upwards of $20 billion and a further $19 billion for GPU and CPU infrastructure required for model training and inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. In return, Microsoft secured a 49% profit share of all services and products charged through OpenAI, as well as access to OpenAI's model weights, specifically the GPT-4 weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>.

This deal has a tiered profit-sharing structure:
*   75% of OpenAI's profits go to Microsoft until they recoup $13 billion of their total investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   After that, the share reduces to 49% until OpenAI reaches $92 billion in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   Beyond $92 billion, the special profit arrangement ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

While this agreement has been beneficial for Microsoft, allowing them to turn a $19 billion investment into a potential $178 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, there are complexities. OpenAI's Copilot, based on OpenAI's models, directly competes with [[Microsofts influence and partnerships in the AI space | Microsoft's own AI offering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Furthermore, Sam Altman is reportedly trying to reduce Microsoft's 49% profit share to make OpenAI more approachable for public markets when they potentially go public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

Some argue that despite the financial returns, [[Microsofts influence and partnerships in the AI space | Microsoft]] might be a "loser" in this situation because they don't ultimately own the core value or "God" (AGI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. OpenAI retains the intellectual property, models, and talent, giving them long-term leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The reliance on [[Microsofts influence and partnerships in the AI space | Microsoft's Azure]] for model training is strong until at least 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, but the long-term sustainability of Microsoft's stronghold is questioned if OpenAI were to switch providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

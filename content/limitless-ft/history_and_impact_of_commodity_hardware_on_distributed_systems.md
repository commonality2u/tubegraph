The development of distributed systems, particularly in the context of [[role_of_hardware_in_the_evolution_of_cloud_computing | cloud computing]], fundamentally relies on advances in commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This relationship highlights a broader principle where [[hardware_and_software_revolutions | hardware revolutions]] often precede [[hardware_and_software_revolutions | software revolutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Foundation of Cloud Computing

The core concept of [[role_of_hardware_in_the_evolution_of_cloud_computing | cloud computing]] is based on the idea of deploying a large quantity of inexpensive, commodity hardware in a centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This approach leverages the cost-effectiveness of widely available components rather than specialized, high-cost hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Role of Distributed Systems

Distributed systems are designed to operate on top of this commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. These systems utilize sophisticated algorithms to manage the underlying hardware, specifically addressing issues like failures and breakdowns in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Cost Advantage

By effectively managing commodity hardware and incorporating fault tolerance, distributed systems offer a significant cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This model is considerably more economical than an organization hosting and maintaining its own dedicated hardware infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Underlying Hardware Progress

The feasibility of [[role_of_hardware_in_the_evolution_of_cloud_computing | cloud computing]] and, by extension, the reliance on commodity hardware for distributed systems, was only made possible by over two decades of continuous advancements in components such as memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This sustained progress in hardware laid the essential groundwork for the widespread adoption and development of modern distributed architectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

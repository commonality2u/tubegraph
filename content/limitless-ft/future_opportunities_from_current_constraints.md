Limitless is a show dedicated to exploring [[breakthrough_technologies_shaping_the_future | breakthrough technologies reshaping our world]] and guiding listeners through the rapidly evolving future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It aims to [[exploration_of_technological_frontiers | explore the frontiers of technology]] that are poised to significantly alter the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The podcast features interviews with founders, builders, and investors who are actively shaping what comes next, encouraging critical thinking about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Limitless is presented by Bankless, with new co-hosts Josh and Jaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In addition to guest interviews, the show hosts a weekly roundtable discussing the rapid progress in the AI space and its societal and cultural impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Unlocking Tomorrow's Opportunities

Limitless extends Bankless's inherent curiosity for [[Frontier_technologies_and_their_implications | new frontiers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It offers a comprehensive [[exploration_of_technological_frontiers | exploration of technology]] across various industries, including:
*   Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   Robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   Manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Synthetic biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   [[space_exploration_and_its_economic_potential | Space exploration]] and rocket ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

The core premise of the show is that "what feels like fundamental constraints on humanity today will become tomorrow's opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Limitless aims to explore these opportunities and illuminate an "infinitely expanding horizon" to prepare audiences for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## The Next Revolution: From Bits to Atoms

Historically, the "world of bits" (digital advancements) has accelerated rapidly, while the "world of atoms" (physical technologies) has lagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, this trend is shifting, marking "day zero" of a new revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. With the emergence of a "new AI world order," there is significant potential energy for creating novel innovations that embody the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The show invites listeners to join this journey of "peeking around the corner" and exploring how drastically different lives are expected to become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Limitless strives to spread education about what's on the [[Frontier_technologies_and_their_implications | frontier]] to as many people as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

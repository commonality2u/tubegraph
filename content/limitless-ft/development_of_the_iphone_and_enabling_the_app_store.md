The creation of the iPhone was a foundational step that enabled subsequent software revolutions, such as the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This aligns with the principle that [[hardware_revolutions_preceding_software_revolutions | hardware revolutions precede software revolutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Hardware as a Prerequisite for Software Innovation

Significant software advancements, like the App Store, are contingent on underlying hardware developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The App Store, which facilitated the emergence of major companies like Uber, required the existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Foundational Hardware Development for the iPhone

The development of the iPhone itself necessitated prior advancements in hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This included contributions from companies like [[impact_of_qualcomm_and_broadcom_on_technology_advancements | Qualcomm]] and [[impact_of_qualcomm_and_broadcom_on_technology_advancements | Broadcom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Furthermore, it required over two decades of building out communication networks and related technology, primarily at the hardware level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

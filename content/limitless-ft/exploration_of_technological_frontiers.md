## Philosophy

The show operates on the principle that knowledge expands fractally along the frontiers of what is considered possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. What might seem like fundamental constraints on humanity today are anticipated to become [[future_opportunities_from_current_constraints | tomorrow's opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The podcast aims to highlight these opportunities and an infinitely expanding, limitless horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

While the "world of bits" has rapidly accelerated, the "world of atoms" has not kept pace, but this trend is now changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. We are at "day zero" of this next technological revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. As a new [[AI and technological advancements | AI world order]] emerges, there is significant potential energy for creating new innovations that truly embody the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

From: [[limitless-ft]] <br/> 

The **intelligence curse** is defined as the set of incentives that may arise when [[the_future_of_agi_and_its_potential_economic_impact|artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) is unlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. AGI, as defined by OpenAI, is the ability to automate most or all human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. In a world with AGI, there is concern that governments, powerful actors, and corporations will lose the economic incentive to care about regular people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This contrasts with most of human history, where powerful actors needed regular people, leading to an exchange of goods and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Severing this link means relying heavily on goodwill, which is considered less stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The concept mirrors patterns seen in economies afflicted by the [[resource_curse_analogy|resource curse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. "Regular people" refers to everyone who does not primarily possess capital, whether physical or financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This includes white-collar workers and people in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Currently, everyone can contribute economically, giving states and companies an incentive to care about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. If all human labor is replaced, this incentive diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The idea for the intelligence curse arose around the time GPT-3 was announced, suggesting that AGI timelines were shortening from decades to potentially five years or sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It signifies a shift from AGI being purely a technical problem to one with significant social and economic interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The name "intelligence curse" directly derives from the comparison to the [[resource_curse_analogy|resource curse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Intelligence could be a curse if it centralizes power in the hands of a few, rather than distributing it widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Premises of the Intelligence Curse

The core arguments of the intelligence curse rely on three premises:
1.  AGI accrues incredible capability and power, potentially arriving in the near-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
2.  [[AI and the future of employment|AI will replace humans for valuable economic labor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
3.  As a result, powerful actors (nation-states and companies) will no longer have an incentive to care about regular people, as humans cease to be their economic engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This questions the need for welfare states, social structures, and civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Pyramid Replacement and [[AI and the future of employment|AI and the Future of Employment]]

Current corporate structures are hierarchical, with entry-level employees at the base and executives at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Empirically, [[emergence_of_ai_agents_and_coding_optimization|AI is automating tasks with short time horizons first]], progressing slower on longer-horizon tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Additionally, executives are less likely to displace themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The initial phase of automation sees AI replacing entry-level roles; for instance, a senior developer might use Cursor or other AI code generation tools instead of an intern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Initially, a company's human pyramid (represented as blue) would shrink from the bottom up as AI absorbs entry-level, junior, and middle management layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Eventually, the human pyramid might disappear, replaced by an automated "blob" or "square" of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The optimal way to structure AI in companies may differ from traditional human pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Some argue for [[ai_augmented_humans_and_job_displacement|AI-augmented humans]], where AI provides leverage, leading to new and interesting problems for humans to tackle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. However, companies like Cursor demonstrate multi-billion dollar valuations with only a few people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Duolingo's CEO has stated they are an "AI-first company," aiming to automate roles whenever possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The general ethos is towards efficiency and leaner operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

Humans currently hold an advantage in long-horizon tasks like CEO roles, as training AI for complex real-world interactions is harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This "AI uplifts humans" phase may continue for a while, but theoretically, AI can eventually excel at long-term planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. The cost difference between hiring a person and using AI for the same task creates a strong economic incentive for automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Initially, white-collar jobs, especially entry-level programming or customer support, are likely to be affected first due to faster advancements in large language models (LLMs) than robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This could lead to a period where humans are valued for their physical capabilities rather than their brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

### Diffusion Barriers vs. Acceleration Pressures

While diffusion barriers (regulators, institutions, social structures) could slow down AI adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, there are also accelerating pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. AGI may not lead to mass unemployment six months after its arrival, but competitive pressure from other companies or economic downturns could force rapid automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. If investors hype AI and it proves effective, a critical mass of adoption will emerge, fundamentally changing how work is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. AI replacing the economic engine of corporations means it replaces the economic engine of entire societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

## Capital and the Shift of Power

Economists define capital broadly to include money, physical factories, GPUs, and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. Currently, economies require significant human input, with human labor being highly compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. Historically, before the Industrial Revolution, human capital was less important, and human labor had less power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. [[the_future_of_agi_and_its_potential_economic_impact|AI allows for effective substitution of capital for labor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. For instance, instead of hiring talented people, one can spend money on OpenAI credits or tokens, making capital directly convertible into results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

This shift has profound implications for social mobility. Much social mobility today is based on talented humans without capital using their abilities to gain influence and attract investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. The "American dream" relies on hard work and education leading to capital accumulation and social advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. If capital can entirely substitute for labor, the path to social hierarchy becomes much harder, potentially eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. This could lead to a more static society, potentially a permanent caste system locked into the capital ledger one is born into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

While the Industrial Revolution, which replaced physical human labor, was beneficial for humans, it is because human brains became the differentiating factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Post-industrial societies developed complex information economies, leveraging human intellect for abundance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. In a future where AI handles cognitive tasks, the unique human advantage diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

There is a call for a ban on [[risks_of_misaligned_artificial_superintelligence|AI ownership of property and CEO roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Even if humans own the capital, the concentration of capital in a few hands could mean that most people own very little compared to what is needed to command many AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. This could lock people into their existing positions before the "intelligence explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

## Classical Liberalism and the State's Role

The rise of AI could cause classical liberalism to fall apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. Post-feudal, post-Enlightenment societies have generally led to better human outcomes, increased quality of life, wealth, and freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. This progress is often attributed to governments granting rights to citizens not out of altruism, but because citizens' labor was economically valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. States needed to attract labor pools and brains to develop their economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

Governments invest in public goods like education and infrastructure because it increases the productivity and tax revenue from their population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. In the U.S., a large portion of tax revenue comes from income taxes, incentivizing governments to ensure people make more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>. These investments, which we associate with a better quality of life, also provide bargaining power to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.

The cynical view is that government altruism is a happy coincidence of incentive alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. "Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. If humans become less necessary for nation-states, the social construct of granting civil liberties and welfare might fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

### Rentier States and the [[economic_and_social_impacts_of_AI|Economic and Social Impacts of AI]]

[[resource_curse_analogy|The resource curse]] offers real-world examples in "rentier states," which derive a large portion of their revenue from natural resources rather than taxing human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. Examples like the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite trillions in mineral wealth, often have poor citizens because leaders lack incentive to invest in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. This leads to corruption and inequality, as those in power get rich, while the general population does not benefit from the economic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.

Counter-examples like Norway and Oman show that strong institutions or credible threats of uprising can mitigate the resource curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. Norway, with its efficient, anti-corrupt democracy, disperses oil wealth among its people because voters can override capital incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. Oman averted unrest by capitulating to popular demands and distributing wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

However, advanced AI could make it easier for states to surveil and suppress revolutions, potentially removing the threat of uprising as a check on power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>. The open question is whether existing democratic institutions, even robust ones like Norway's, can withstand the "tidal wave" of the intelligence curse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

### The Social Contract

The intelligence curse breaks the traditional social contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. The current equilibrium involves:
*   **Powerful actors** (corporations, states) needing **people** for value (labor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
*   **People** having the power to displace powerful actors through revolts if regimes become too totalitarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.
*   **Rules** (legal systems, constitutions, moral codes) constraining powerful actors, influenced by the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

This balance of power allows individuals to extract concessions from powerful entities, as seen with highly sought-after software engineers at Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. If AI can replace labor more cheaply, the ability of individuals to bargain or displace powerful actors decreases, and powerful actors gain more influence over the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.

Societies historically construct their own social contracts (e.g., the U.S. Constitution) based on shared beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>. The question is whether societies can simply choose a social contract that benefits humans, especially if AGI brings abundance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. However, even with abundance, if humans create none of it, their material power is entirely political, making the arrangement less stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>. Competitive pressures and human greed may not have an intrinsic stopping point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. China, for example, lifted many out of poverty but without granting significant political freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.

The intelligence curse emphasizes that humans should be deeply concerned about scenarios where they lack the material power to guarantee their own abundance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. If written out of the economic and social contracts, humans become reliant on the political one, which is better than nothing but not sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

The distinction between AI capability and power is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. While AI may not be given wealth or self-directed power, the concern is that existing human oppressors could use AI to expand the power differential, making some people far more powerful than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.

## Breaking the Intelligence Curse

To break the intelligence curse, a three-pronged approach is proposed: **avert, diffuse, and democratize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>. This logic works backward: achieving democratization requires diffusion, and diffusion requires averting catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

### Avert: Preventing Catastrophes without Centralizing Control

AI's capacity for misuse (e.g., bioweapons, cyberattacks) and autonomous action could lead to catastrophic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>. Historically, potential disasters justify centralization (e.g., the Patriot Act after 9/11 led to significant restrictions on civil liberties and expanded government power) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. If AGI can run the entire economy, centralizing its development in a few hands resembles centralizing the means of production, which historically leads to high risks of totalitarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.

The solution involves "differential technology development" or "defensive accelerationism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. This means prioritizing the development of technologies that guard against risks and help humans, such as robust cyber defenses before AI can easily launch cyberattacks, or biosecurity measures before AI can design bioweapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a>. The goal is to build technologies that make the "safe, good, pro-human thing" the winning strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>.

### Diffuse: Distributing AI Power to Everyone

Diffusion means ensuring that as many people as possible benefit economically from AI as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. This helps distribute technology widely, ensuring everyone gets "AI superpowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. The aim is to create decentralization so that when humans are automated, it's not by large AI labs but by their own AIs, allowing them to control the fruits of their AI's labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>. This implies broad support for open-source AI models and weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

This process involves two phases:
1.  **Augmentation phase:** Invest in [[ai_augmented_humans_and_job_displacement|AI-augmenting tools]] that empower human users without fully automating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. Tools like Cursor, which assist rather than replace, extend the window of human augmentation and tap into economic opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.
2.  **Alignment to user phase:** Align models directly to individual users, leveraging their tacit knowledge and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>. These personal AIs can represent a user's tastes and judgment, acting throughout the economy and ensuring the user is compensated for their AI's economic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>.

### Democratize: Maintaining Human Agency and Political Power

Democratization focuses on the distribution of power to the people so they can hold institutions in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>. From a tech-centric perspective, this means advancing technologies that make governance, verification, coordination, and trust easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>. AI can help policymakers understand voters' opinions, advocate on behalf of individuals, and provide incorruptible judgments for auditing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>. Technologies that allow for verification without human long-term memory can create more effective and representative governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a>.

By strengthening democratic structures, human incentives can override capital incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. This approach aims to keep humans meaningfully economically involved in various ways while also strengthening democratic incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>.

## The Payoff: A Post-Scarcity Utopia

If the intelligence curse is successfully addressed, the payoff is immense. AGI represents potentially the greatest technological revolution in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>. The promise includes:
*   Curing unimaginable diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>.
*   Achieving [[ai_as_a_tool_for_post_scarcity_society|total abundance]] and unlocking vast resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>.
*   Providing experiences once limited to the ultra-elite to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:58">[01:29:58]</a>.
*   Abolishing poverty and disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.
*   Humans gaining more agency and control over their world with fewer drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:12">[01:30:12]</a>.

This vision of a [[surviving_and_thriving_in_a_postagi_world|post-AGI world]] is one where challenges are met with solutions, enabling humanity to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:17">[01:31:17]</a>.

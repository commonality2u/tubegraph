The prevailing view is that hardware revolutions fundamentally precede software revolutions, almost to the point of being a definitional concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. New software opportunities often emerge directly from breakthroughs in underlying hardware capabilities.

## Examples of Hardware Preceding Software

*   **Mobile App Ecosystems**: The emergence of the App Store, which facilitated the creation of major software companies like Uber, was directly dependent on the existence of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The iPhone itself relied on decades of hardware development from companies like Qualcomm and Broadcom, as well as 20 years of building out communications technology and networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This demonstrates the profound [[relationship_between_hardware_development_and_app_ecosystems]].
*   **Deep Learning**: The advancements in deep learning algorithms were made possible by the availability of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which represent 20 years of progress in specialized hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Cloud Computing**: The foundation of [[role_of_hardware_in_the_evolution_of_cloud_computing | cloud computing]] rests on the concept of utilizing very cheap commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The core idea of a cloud is to consolidate numerous pieces of [[history_and_impact_of_commodity_hardware_on_distributed_systems | cheap commodity hardware]] in one location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   [[history_and_impact_of_commodity_hardware_on_distributed_systems | Distributed systems]] algorithms are then applied on top of this commodity hardware to manage failures and breaks in a fault-tolerant manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This approach offers a significant cost advantage over an organization hosting its own hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The development of cloud computing required over 20 years of advancements in memory and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

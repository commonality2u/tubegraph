[[Elon Musks personal development | Elon]] is considered a product of 50 years of compounded effort, suffering, and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. An underappreciated aspect of his current effectiveness is his ability to assemble a collective of around 20 highly talented individuals over the past 20 to 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. These individuals are described as some of the most talented humans on the planet, with encounters with such people occurring only a couple of times a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Building Elite Teams
It takes about a decade of testing and evaluating someone to truly understand their potential and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Every one of Musk's companies typically features about five "out of this world talented" individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These key people often operate with a "mind meld," understanding what needs to be done without explicit communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This process of building such an effective, self-sustaining "organism" cannot be rushed and requires approximately 20 years to reach maximal evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This demonstrates [[the_time_required_to_develop_talented_teams | the time required to develop talented teams]] and highlights [[the_role_of_teamwork_in_elon_musks_success | the role of teamwork]] in his ventures.

Pitching investors for an [[AIpowered business strategies | AI-driven business]] involves a unique approach, particularly in a rapidly evolving market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The journey of Custom AI Studio, an actual [[developing_ai_agents_and_their_market_potential | AI agent]] company, provides insights into navigating funding, from initial concept to securing strategic investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Choosing the Right Partner: Strategic vs. VC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

Traditional Private Equity (PE) groups and Venture Capital (VC) firms differ fundamentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Custom AI Studio opted for a strategic partner over a large VC firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This decision prioritized a partner who understood their vision and offered support, rather than just large capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A strategic partner offers a level of trust, focusing on long-term support for a newer business rather than constant quarter-over-quarter growth pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Key considerations for a strategic partner:
*   **Accessibility** Being able to meet in person easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   **Guidance** Addressing blind spots and providing advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Shared Experience** Tapping into knowledge, experience, and resources, especially if they have built a similar business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Flexibility** A partner who understands and supports the discovery phase, allowing flexibility in business models (e.g., agency vs. SaaS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

## Evolution of the Business Model: From SaaS Attempts to Agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

Upon the release of ChatGPT, the founders recognized the potential for [[understanding_ai_for_enhancing_business_profits | AI to change everything]] and decided to start an AI company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Initially, the goal was to build a SaaS product, as it offered the best multiples and valuations for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Early SaaS product attempts included:
*   A research report writing agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   A semantic search tool for retrieving documents (e.g., healthcare and legal records) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   A chatbot for interacting with 10K SEC filings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

These attempts highlighted the significant upfront capital needed for building a product and gaining market share in the SaaS space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The rapid advancements in AI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) also posed a risk, as new features could quickly wipe out existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This led to the realization that building a SaaS product in this emerging [[future_of_saas_and_aidriven_businesses | AI market]] was too risky at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This aligns with the [[challenges_of_building_a_saas_in_the_emerging_ai_market | Challenges of building a SaaS in the emerging AI market]].

The team then shifted to an agency model, offering broad [[AIpowered business strategies | AI solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This involved doing significant free work to gain experience, build case studies, and secure paid projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This strategy allowed them to:
*   Generate cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   Increase experience in building AI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   Gradually improve their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   Gain a unique pulse on the market by interacting with various professionals and working on dozens of projects across industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

This market understanding helped identify genuine use cases for AI, focusing on ROI for business owners rather than just technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The shift also solidified their focus on [[developing_ai_agents_and_their_market_potential | AI agents]], recognizing their potential to traverse the digital space beyond simple chatbots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This agentic approach, leveraging APIs and LLMs for reasoning, was seen as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### The Problem with AI Agent Tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>
Many startups initially aim to build "Last Mile" application layer products that provide direct value and ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. However, they often find this difficult and instead develop tools for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. These internal tools are then spun out as products to developers who are willing to spend money on new AI tools, leading to an "explosion of development tools" rather than application-focused solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Scaling and Securing Investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>

A viral YouTube video provided significant momentum, generating 26 projects and greatly increasing cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This led to a critical decision: build a lifestyle business by bootstrapping or "go big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Choosing to "go big" necessitated seeking external funding to scale the team, build infrastructure, and invest in sales and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Options for funding included:
*   Strategic investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>
*   Angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>
*   Venture Capital (VCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>
*   Private Equity (PE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>
*   Friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>
*   Crypto tokens (with high fluctuation risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>
*   Crowdsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>
*   Continued bootstrapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>

The strategic route was chosen due to the desire for a partner who could offer more than just capital, including expertise in managing overseas talent and understanding the complexities of an agency model in the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### What Investors Look For in AI Startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>
Investors are eager to enter the AI space but often want to outsource the effort of keeping up with technology and building systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. They seek an "operator" â€“ someone obsessed with the space, focused on growth, and capable of [[blueprint_for_integrating_ai_into_business | building a business]] and team regardless of funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

Key qualities investors look for:
*   **Focus and Obsession** Deep commitment to the AI space and the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   **Operator Mentality** Ability to get things done, focusing on systems, operations, and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   **Northstar Vision** A clear, planted flag on what the company aims to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Team Building** Evidence of attracting talented individuals even before investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Business Acumen** Understanding of financials, projections, accounting, and contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Frugality** Demonstrated ability to manage expenses wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Confidence and Clarity** A strong, unwavering vision that resists being swayed by every external suggestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

### Capitalizing on Momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>
A viral video provided temporary attention and investment inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. The decision was made to capitalize on this momentum quickly, recognizing that the "Founders Market" for AI investment, where founders have more control, would not last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. The speed of scaling was prioritized over extended negotiations on equity splits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

Quote from Jeff Bezos:
> "You need to be stubborn on your vision but very flexible on the details." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>

This means the ultimate goal and impact are more important than the minute details of terms or potential payouts. The focus should be on securing the "fuel" (investment) to grow the pie, as growth provides the knowledge and experience to achieve greater long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

## Current Business Model & Future Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>
Custom AI Studio is currently focused on "Agenceta-go," productizing their service by building "agentic operating systems" for various industries and departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. The goal is to standardize the development process for these systems first, then explore spinning off standalone products or working with channel partners to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. The focus remains on demonstrating the tangible ROI for businesses by automating administrative tasks across different pillars like sales, operations, marketing, and HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

Investors see the company as a development arm that can spin off products for them to take to market, especially in the vertical agents space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. This partnership model allows for the continued development of [[building_a_highprofit_lowcost_business_with_ai_agents | AI agents]] while leveraging external resources for market penetration.

The ease of securing investment in the AI space is temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. As more companies enter, and failures occur, investors will become more critical. By the end of 2025, the market is expected to shift from a "Founders Market" to an "Investors Market," requiring a more competitive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

The evolution of software distribution and consumption has seen significant shifts, with the emergence and growth of Software as a Service (SaaS) being a pivotal development. This model transformed how businesses acquired and utilized software, moving away from traditional licensed products to subscription-based services delivered over the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## From Licensed Software to SaaS

Historically, software was often packaged and sold as a product that users would purchase annually, similar to Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, or Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Users would buy a version for the year and either upgrade the next year or stick with the older version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

The transition to the SaaS model became viable primarily due to a reduction in compute costs and the ability to outsource storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Instead of companies needing to build and host their own server racks, they could utilize third-party servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This outsourcing of compute and server costs made the Software as a Service model possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Consequently, it became "super cheap to build software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, making the [[business_models_and_pricing_for_automation_technologies | business model]] highly attractive to investors, leading to a significant influx of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Rise of Vertical SaaS

Initially, SaaS products were often general-purpose tools like Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), or Content Management Systems (CMS), designed for broad application across various companies and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

However, entrepreneurs and developers identified opportunities in the gaps within these general offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This led to the emergence of the "vertical SaaS model," where software products were developed to address specific needs within particular industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Examples include software platforms tailored for car dealerships or nursing homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This specialized model proved highly successful, attracting significant investment from private equity due to strong multiples and valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## SaaS and the AI Era

The success of the SaaS model, particularly vertical SaaS, has led to efforts to replicate this approach with Large Language Models (LLMs) and [[agentic_operating_systems_and_their_evolution | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Many, including the speaker, believe there is an opportunity to adapt this proven model for the emerging AI landscape, although it is viewed as an interim step towards a more comprehensive "agentic future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This suggests a continued evolution in [[future_of_saas_and_aidriven_businesses | the future of SaaS and AI-driven businesses]].

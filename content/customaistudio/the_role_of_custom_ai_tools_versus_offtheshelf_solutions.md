## The Evolution of Tooling in AI Company Building

Early in building an AI company, the speaker and their team initially relied on readily available, off-the-shelf solutions for their tooling needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. The prevailing belief was that others had already developed effective solutions for common problems, leading to constant "tool hopping" in search of a "silver bullet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This approach stemmed from the assumption that the market had things "figured out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

### Limitations of Off-the-Shelf Tools

While existing tools like Zapier or Make were seen as helpful, they rarely provided a complete solution for specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The speaker likens off-the-shelf agentic AI tools to traditional SaaS platforms, which, despite their benefits, often lead to "tech stack bloat" and fail to integrate cohesively into a holistic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. These tools force users to "bend your architecture to their limits," affecting the system's logic and imposing significant limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### The Shift to Custom Tooling

A pivotal realization for the company was that "nobody has it figured out" in the nascent AI space; it's an "even playing field" where everyone is still "hacking away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This led to a strategic pivot: the company decided to **[[creating_customizable_tools_for_ai_agents | build their own tools]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

The focus shifted to developing custom tools for specific functions such as:
*   Data processing, labeling, and cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>
*   API function calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>
*   Data retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>
*   Prompt engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>

This approach provides full control over the tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, allowing for more relevant and effective solutions for clients, faster iteration cycles, and the development of valuable intellectual property (IP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

> "We are the only ones who know the tools that we need, so we must build them ourselves." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>

## Key Learnings on Custom Tooling

*   **Months spent tool hopping:** The initial search for external solutions was time-consuming and inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Shared challenges:** Even experienced AI and machine learning teams face similar roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **No vendor has a "done-for-you" answer:** The emerging nature of AI means bespoke solutions are often necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on architecture:** Off-the-shelf tools can dictate system architecture, limiting flexibility and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

## Roadmap for Custom Tooling

The future roadmap for custom tooling includes:
*   **Dynamic Tools:** A major initiative aimed at creating highly flexible and modular API calling capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Prompt Evaluation and Optimization Frameworks:** Tools and workflows for evaluating and improving prompt performance automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **High-Volume Testing Infrastructure:** Systems to push large volumes of data through agents for testing and processing, including historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **API Research and Reference Workflow:** Automated processes to gather API documentation and schemas from client tech stacks, enabling faster integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   **Events Data Processing Workflow:** Tools to process real-time data from various sources (emails, Slack, meeting transcripts) to understand operational workflows and identify AI opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This includes mapping employee timelines and data interactions to inform agent design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

This commitment to custom tooling enables the development of **[[creating_customizable_tools_for_ai_agents | Agentic Operating Systems]]** (Agent OS), which are holistic, dynamic systems that orchestrate automations and workflows as part of their core toolset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The goal is to move beyond simple process automation towards building **[[integrating_ai_tools_into_operational_processes | agentic systems]]** that redefine business operations and margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

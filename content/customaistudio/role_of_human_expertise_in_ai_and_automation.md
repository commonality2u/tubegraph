The landscape of business automation is continually evolving, from Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in the 2010s to the current era of [[Impact of Agentic AI on business automation | agentic AI]] and large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Despite the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, human expertise remains a critical component for successful implementation and long-term value.

## Evolution of Automation: From RPA to Agentic AI

Early automation efforts, particularly in the BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) industry around 2012, focused on emulating routine and mundane tasks performed by people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Tasks suitable for outsourcing were often routine, mundane, structured, and repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This environment was a "perfect framework" for the nascent RPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

The initial approach to automation often involved:
*   **Arbitrage and offshore teams** to solve enterprise problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   Applying principles like Six Sigma, continuous improvement, and Lean Kaizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   Developing simplistic ratios like "one robot can do the work of 4.2 people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>, often based on the idea that robots don't sleep or take vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

However, even in these early stages, automation rarely covered 100% of a workflow. It would often automate disparate "pieces" of a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, necessitating human involvement at various stages. This meant that the process often required "humans in the loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, leading to complex solutions that did "some of the stuff, but not all of the stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## The Hybrid Approach: [[Human and AI collaboration | Human and AI Collaboration]]

Despite AI becoming significantly more powerful than a decade ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, it is not a "panacea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The concept of a hybrid model, which leverages both human talent and AI capabilities, is gaining traction. This approach respects the strengths of both human intelligence and advanced AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

Key aspects of a hybrid solution include:
*   **Human in the loop:** World-class talent can be tapped for design context, human in the loop functions, and ongoing support and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **AI's role:** AI can handle tasks from basic workflow automation to more complex data analysis, content creation, and autonomous elements of [[impact_of_agentic_ai_on_business_automation | agentic AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Combined impact:** By combining these, organizations can achieve "pretty powerful solutions that solve people's problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

For end-to-end solutions, especially in enterprises, it's often a "concatenation of human and and" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a> roles. Examples of processes that require human involvement include:
*   **Human Resources:** Talent acquisition, onboarding, and ongoing staff support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. These cannot be so "cold" as to just have robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain and Logistics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Finance and Accounting:** Often require "eyes on elements" depending on the transaction type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Regulated industries:** In areas like mortgages, certified human officers are legally required for certain steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

Ultimately, clients should not care what percentage of a solution is AI and what percentage is human intelligence; they just want the service delivered at agreed-upon levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Challenges of Integrating Human and AI Expertise

Integrating AI and human expertise comes with several challenges:

### Bridging the Knowledge Gap
There's a significant gap between AI specialists immersed in the technology and business professionals focused on their day jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. While ChatGPT has made AI concepts easier to grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>, many people still don't understand terms like "AI agent" or "agentic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. The key is to connect AI capabilities to business outcomes, addressing what keeps clients "up at night" and what helps them get "promoted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

### Extracting Subject Matter Expertise (SME)
One of the most difficult aspects is extracting detailed subject matter expertise from human brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Subject matter experts (SMEs) and process owners often struggle to articulate their processes in a way that can be easily configured into an automated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Designs based on SME input were "always wrong" when it came to actual configuration because of unspoken nuances or forgotten exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
The hope is that the "learning ability of large language models" might assist in the interrogation stage by asking probing questions and inferring next steps, which humans can then confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Organizational Silos
Historically, enterprises have created specialized teams (e.g., continuous improvement, RPA Center of Excellence, machine learning teams) that often operate in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This fragmentation can hinder the successful deployment of [[designing_and_integrating_ai_agent_teams_to_automate_business_functions | agentic AI]], which needs to "work across all of those realities" by handling unstructured data, executing workflow steps, and providing analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. A unified, hybrid team is essential for an "agentic operating system across the organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## Reusability and Customization
Unlike traditional SaaS products, which are designed for broad reusability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, AI automation, especially [[Impact of Agentic AI on business automation | agentic AI]], often requires significant customization. Enterprises are inherently "special and different" due to their unique evolutionary steps, including legacy systems, acquired companies, and varied software stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

For RPA, it was often harder to edit an existing process for a new client than to build a new one from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This highlights the deep need for human consultants who understand the scope and needs of each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. While [[Impact of Agentic AI on business automation | agentic]] workflows may offer more flexibility and adaptability in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, the challenge remains in extracting the "subject matter expertise from people in a way where we can develop a framework out of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, rather than rigid step-by-step instructions.

## The Future of Human and AI Integration

The [[future_of_ai_and_human_integration_in_business | future of AI and human integration in business]] points towards an "agentic operating system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a> that leverages both advanced technology and human insight. This requires a shift in mindset from treating AI merely as a tool to viewing it as a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

The foundational principle businesses need to rethink is abandoning the specialization of AI into separate, isolated tools and instead building a unified approach where AI is integrated as a partner across operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This involves:
*   **Focusing on outcomes:** Prioritizing solutions that drive efficiency, reduce churn, and increase revenue, rather than just implementing "sexy shiny stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.
*   **Consultative selling:** Being willing to tell clients what they *need* instead of just what they *want*, even if it means walking away from a project if it's not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Recognizing human value:** Understanding that there is still "huge value to humans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a> in orchestrating complex organizational changes and providing strategic oversight.

The concept of "masters of process" remains relevant, where human experts focus on understanding and redesigning operations to best utilize available digital tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. This involves simplification, automation, virtualization (leveraging human or AI "gig workers"), and orchestration to ensure continuous evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Ultimately, the successful integration of AI requires acknowledging the ongoing indispensable role of human expertise in navigating complexity, fostering trust, and delivering tangible business value.

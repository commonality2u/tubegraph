While AI agents offer significant advantages over traditional automation, their implementation comes with specific [[challenges_in_developing_autonomous_ai_agents | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. These primarily revolve around the initial setup and data quality.

## Complexity in Implementation
Implementing AI agents can be complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Unlike traditional automation, which is often straightforward to set up for simple, repetitive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, [[building_and_deploying_ai_agents | building and deploying AI agents]] requires a more nuanced approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

## Requirement for Quality Data
A significant challenge is the critical need for high-quality data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. AI agents are only as effective as the data they receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. For an agent to perform well, the following data inputs must be of high quality:
*   **Incoming Data** The data an agent receives needs to be high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Base Data** The contextual knowledge base provided to the agent must be high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **Prompts** The prompts, considered as data, need to be extremely high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. This highlights a key aspect of [[challenges_in_ai_prompt_engineering_and_development | challenges in AI prompt engineering and development]].

## Impact of Improper Setup
If an AI agent is not set up properly, it will not scale effectively or perform well in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. This underlines the importance of careful initial configuration and ongoing maintenance to ensure optimal performance and scalability as businesses grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Automation technologies, from Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to modern Agentic AI, present unique challenges and opportunities in their business models and pricing structures. Ian, a leader in digital transformation with over 25 years of experience in strategy, sales, and marketing, provides insights from his journey leading the RPA era and how it applies to the current wave of AI automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Evolution of Business Models and Pricing

### Early RPA: Consulting and the "T-Shirt Model"
In the early days of RPA (around 2012-2013), the primary engagement model was a consulting shop, where pricing was based on time and materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This approach was necessary because the technology was so new, making it difficult to commit to a particular outcome or precisely estimate project scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

As experience grew, a "t-shirt model" emerged, classifying projects as small, medium, or large. This helped avoid spending excessive time on detailed estimations, fostering trust and enabling faster project initiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Challenges with Outcome-Based Pricing
Outcome-based pricing, while theoretically appealing, proved problematic. Issues included:
*   **Attribution**: Difficulty in isolating the impact of the automation solution versus other client initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Clients were often reluctant to share internal metrics needed for calculation, fearing exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Trust**: The need for intense transparency often strained the client-provider relationship from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Communicating Value in New Technology Waves

A significant challenge with nascent technologies like RPA and [[Impact of Agentic AI on business automation | Agentic AI]] is the knowledge gap between specialists and the general business audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

*   **Early RPA**: Many potential clients did not understand what RPA was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Current AI**: While ChatGPT made AI concepts more accessible, terms like "AI agent" or "agentic" remain unfamiliar to most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

The key communication strategy is to always link the technology back to the client's fundamental business problems and desired outcomes, such as:
*   More efficient operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>
*   Reduction in churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
*   Increase in top-line revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>

This approach, focusing on "what is keeping them up at night and what gets them promoted," is crucial for long-term client satisfaction, rather than merely selling "sexy shiny stuff" that might initially attract interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Niche vs. Horizontal Application

While common advice suggests niching down by industry, the early stages of [[Automating business processes with AI agents | AI automation]] and [[Designing and integrating AI agent teams to automate business functions | AI agent]] frameworks benefit from a horizontal approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

*   **Process Mastery as a Niche**: Instead of an industry niche, focusing on being "masters of process" allows understanding and applying automation capabilities across various operational functions. This involves assessing each "atomic particle" of an operation to determine what can be done differently with AI, regardless of whether it's employee onboarding or supply chain logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **The "Hammer and Nail" Analogy**: Having a "hammer" (the understanding of AI capabilities) allows addressing any "nail" (an automatable task). However, caution is advised, as not every problem is a "nail," especially with legacy systems that require different approaches (like "screws" not suitable for a hammer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

## Reusability in Automation
Reusability was a significant challenge in RPA due to the unique evolutionary path of each enterprise's technology stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. It was often harder to modify an existing RPA solution for a new client than to build a new one from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

*   **SAS vs. Services**: Traditional Software as a Service (SaaS) offers standardized, reusable solutions, but can be rigid. Historically, large ERP implementations were highly customized consulting "boondoggles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
*   **Agentic AI Potential**: The future of [[Impact of Agentic AI on business automation | Agentic AI]] might offer more flexible, adaptive workflows that can "adapt and reason," potentially increasing reusability. This would require isolating task logic and reasoning from specific client data, especially in sensitive industries like healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

## Challenges with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
Extracting accurate subject matter expertise from humans is notoriously difficult. SMEs may not fully understand why certain steps are performed or recall all edge cases, leading to errors in solution design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

*   **LLM Potential**: Large Language Models could assist in the "interrogation stage" by asking follow-up questions, seeking additional answers, and inferring missing steps based on digital common sense, then confirming with humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

## Treating AI as a Partner, Not Just a Tool
A foundational principle for businesses is to avoid siloing AI capabilities into separate departments or "Centers of Excellence" (CoEs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. Historically, RPA CoEs, machine learning teams, and other specialized units often operated in isolation, hindering comprehensive digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

[[Impact of Agentic AI on business automation | Agentic AI]] is powerful because it can "work across all of those realities" â€“ handling unstructured data, executing workflows, streamlining processes, and generating insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. To leverage this, organizations need [[Designing and integrating AI agent teams to automate business functions | hybrid teams]] and a broader, strategic vision for an "agentic operating system" across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

## Pricing Challenges with AI Automation
Pricing AI automation shares similarities with consulting, where specialists should be compensated for their expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. However, a unique challenge in the AI space is the narrative of "democratization" and "low code/no code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.

*   **Misconception**: Clients may perceive AI as "easy" (like using ChatGPT) and expect solutions to be simple or cheap, leading to frustration when faced with complex, enterprise-grade development costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   **Reality**: Building robust, reliable AI systems is complex and requires specialized skills, stakeholder management, clear communication, and a well-defined vision, which account for the majority of project complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

## The Future of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)
BPO is traditionally defined by its FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) based pricing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. This structure resists innovation, as proposals outside of headcount-based comparisons are often rejected by procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

*   **Disruption**: BPOs are set to be disrupted. A new type of BPO will emerge, combining cutting-edge AI with world-class human talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Model**: This new model will require a commercial structure that rewards innovation and evolution, something traditional BPO incentives currently lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.
*   **Gig Work Parallel**: The idea of stitching together "gig workers" (AI agents, APIs, or human talent for specific tasks) to achieve end-to-end processes is a relevant analogy for how complex operations can be optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.

Ultimately, businesses leveraging AI should focus on delivering services at agreed-upon service levels, where the mix of AI and human intelligence ("HI") is irrelevant to the client, as long as the desired outcome is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. This requires a strong consultative sales approach, educating clients on what is feasible and focusing on solving their core problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>.

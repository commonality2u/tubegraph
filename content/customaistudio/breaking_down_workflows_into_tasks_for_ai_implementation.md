To effectively identify impactful AI use cases, a structured six-step approach can be followed, beginning with a clear understanding of operational business outcomes and progressively breaking them down into granular tasks for AI integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## 1. Identify Operational Business Outcomes

The first step is to write down the specific operational business outcomes, which are typically Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These are the crucial levers an organization aims to improve to enhance overall business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Examples of operational outcomes include:
*   **Sales Team**: Book 30 meetings per month with qualified leads per Sales Representative (SR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. For a team of five SRs, this translates to 150 booked meetings monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. With a 30% close rate, the target is 50 closed deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Director**: Close $325K in combined revenue per month, with $125K from new business and $200K from renewals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   **Content Marketing**: Generate 7,500 warm leads through video organic content on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. These leads should convert to 150 booked meetings (2% conversion rate) and ultimately 50 closed deals (30% conversion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Operations**: Increase the ROI of the sales team by 1% monthly (12% annually), decrease unqualified leads in CRM using lead scoring, maintain CRM data hygiene, increase sales efficiency by removing bottlenecks and introducing new tools, and track team productivity and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## 2. List Contributing Workflows

Once outcomes are defined, the next step is to list all workflows that contribute to achieving each outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. These can include daily routines, reminder settings, or specific operational sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Workflows are broad descriptions of processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

Examples of workflows:
*   **Sales Representative (SR)**: Ensure leads are qualified, decrease no-show rates, prepare the sales director, and follow up on opportunities until they are closed won or lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   **Content Marketing**: Conduct competitor research, track trends, engage in consistent high-volume and value posting, develop lead magnets, and manage a content calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## 3. Break Down Workflows into Tasks

This crucial step involves breaking down each identified workflow into a series of detailed tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. For each task, specific information should be recorded:

*   **Input Data Type and Description**: What data initiates the task? For example, "an email from a customer in CRM requesting X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making Process**: Describe how a human would process the input. For instance, a customer service representative pulls up the customer record, analyzes the request, and decides on a response to maintain the relationship or assist with troubleshooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Instructions Based on Input**: Detail the specific actions or decision trees. For a refund request, instructions might include first checking for technical issues that can be troubleshooted, and if not, then providing reasons for denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. It's important not to overcomplicate the decision tree for every edge case, as processes evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Platforms Used and Reason**: Document the tools involved, such as HubSpot for CRM, Gmail for communication, or Google Drive for accessing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Note if a single task requires navigating multiple platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Estimated Time to Complete**: Provide time estimates for the task, even on a unit-by-unit scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. For example, how long does it take to prospect a single person, or individual microtasks within a larger workflow like creating a YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   **People Involved and Their Roles**: Identify who performs the task and their position within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   **Volume of Executions**: Quantify how often the task is performed (per day, week, hour, month, or year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   **Success Metrics**: Determine if there are specific KPIs associated with the task, often deriving from workflow or combined workflow metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## 4. Identify AI Opportunities

With a detailed list of tasks, the next step is to identify which tasks could be performed by AI, such as ChatGPT, given the appropriate context and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This step aims to pinpoint areas where AI can remove operational bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Recognizing that an AI model could reliably perform a task, if provided the necessary data, indicates an [[implementing_and_utilizing_ai_agent_tools_for_various_business_operations | AI opportunity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

## 5. Automate with Integration Tools

Instead of manually feeding information to AI models (e.g., copying and pasting customer tickets into ChatGPT), integrate AI capabilities directly into operational processes using automation platforms like N8N <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. Such platforms can connect various systems, allowing AI models to access necessary data (e.g., an inbox for customer emails) and perform tasks automatically, thereby achieving [[automating_business_processes_with_ai_agents | full automation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. This approach represents the "next level" of [[integrating_ai_tools_into_operational_processes | integrating AI tools into operational processes]], moving beyond simple copy-paste interactions to seamless, automated workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

The company has soft-launched a community to foster discussion and share ideas related to [[AI agent projects and learnings | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This community is currently free for discussion and chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, with a link provided in the video description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Educational Content and Focus
The community will eventually transition to a paid model once tutorial videos and course modules are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. These educational resources aim to provide a deeper understanding of [[AI agent projects and learnings | AI]] in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, including:
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Explanations on how RAG actually works, its function (expanding the prompt rather than teaching the agent new information), and conceptualizing the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Insights into how [[LLMs]] are built, why they consume significant energy, and the implications of scaling compute on their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **The AI Stack:** A comprehensive grasp of the current [[Technological infrastructure and integrations | generative AI stack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Advanced Agent Concepts:** New learnings regarding [[Agentic prompting and decisionmaking frameworks | multi-agent systems]], achieving consistent output from agents, ensuring reliable tool calling, and comparing [[AI agent frameworks and platforms | frameworks]] like OpenAI Swarm versus LangChain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. It will also cover selecting appropriate [[Technological infrastructure and integrations | vector databases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

The creation of these educational videos is an ongoing process, influenced by continuous new learnings about building agents more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## Community vs. YouTube Content Strategy
While occasional tutorial videos may be posted on YouTube, the primary platform for detailed educational content and new learnings will be the paid community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. This strategy allows for sharing new insights more quickly without needing to produce full YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. The YouTube channel will maintain a different content angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. The company aims to provide clarity on the [[Market trends and future goals in AI | AI space]] by actively experimenting with new tools, systems, and architectural approaches for agents, ultimately building a solid playbook for implementation in any business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

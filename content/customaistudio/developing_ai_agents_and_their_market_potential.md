Custom AI Studio, an [[AI agent projects and learnings | AI agent company]], has shared insights into their journey of developing [[understanding_and_implementing_ai_agents_in_businesses | AI agents]] and navigating the investment landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Their experience offers a unique perspective on [[building_and_deploying_ai_agents | building and deploying AI agents]] from inception through securing funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Evolution of the Business Model: From SaaS to Agency

Initially, the team sought to build a Software as a Service (SaaS) product, as it typically offers the best multiples and valuations for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Despite not being technical themselves, they partnered with development firms in Israel, India, and Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Early SaaS product attempts included:
*   A research report writing agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   A semantic search tool for retrieving documents, like healthcare records or legal documents, allowing users to "chat with documents" via RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and get the source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This was considered ahead of its time but required too much effort to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   A chatbot for interacting with 10K SEC filings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

These SaaS ventures faced challenges, including limited market uptake and the significant upfront capital required to build a product and gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The rapid pace of AI development also posed a risk; new features or improved models from major players like ChatGPT, Anthropic, or Google could quickly render their products obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Recognizing the risks of the SaaS model in a volatile AI market, the company pivoted to an agency model, offering broad [[implementing_and_utilizing_ai_agent_tools_for_various_business_operations | AI solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This approach offered several advantages:
*   **Cash flow generation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Increased "reps" at building systems** and improving weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Opportunities to consult with hundreds of industry professionals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Working on numerous projects** in various industries, providing a unique market pulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This allowed them to understand genuine use cases, people's understanding of AI, and desired ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

During this period, they explored various [[tools_and_resources_for_building_ai_agents | AI tools]] and frameworks, including Relevance AI, Mind Studio, Crew AI, Autogen, Zapier, and Voice Flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. They eventually focused on [[current_trends_in_ai_agent_platforms | AI agents]] as the future, particularly when Zapier and ChatGPT partnered, demonstrating the potential for LLMs to traverse digital spaces via APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## From Growth to Funding: The Decision to "Go Big"

A viral YouTube video, "18 Months of Building AI Agents in 42 Minutes," significantly boosted their visibility, leading to 26 new projects and a massive increase in cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This growth led to a critical decision: continue bootstrapping as a lifestyle business or seek capital to "go big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Choosing the latter required fuel (money) for operational expenses (OpEx), infrastructure, sales and marketing, and internal operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Funding Strategy: Strategic Partner over Traditional VC

The company received investment inquiries from various sources, including strategic investors, angels, VCs, and private equity firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. They even considered crypto tokens, where startups offer a token and use a percentage of gas fees for investment, though this comes with high fluctuation risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

They opted for a strategic investor over a traditional VC firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The reasons for this choice included:
*   **Proximity**: The investor was local, allowing for easy in-person meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   **Guidance**: The strategic partner offered advice and resources for their "blind spots," having built a similar business in a different market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Shared Vision**: They prioritized a partner who saw their vision over a large VC firm that might offer capital but lack necessary support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The strategic partner understood the discovery phase of an agency model, which VCs, focused on SaaS, might not have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: The agency model provided flexibility, which aligned better with a strategic partner than the rigid SaaS focus often demanded by VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

Investors in the AI space are often looking to get involved without doing the intensive work themselves, seeking an "operator" obsessed with the field who can build and grow a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. They seek to outsource the effort of keeping up with news, exploring technology, and troubleshooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

### Intangible Qualities Investors Seek

Discussions with investors revealed several key intangible qualities they valued:
*   **Focus and Obsession**: Demonstrating unwavering commitment to the AI space and the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   **Operator Mentality**: The ability to get things done, focusing on systems, operations, efficiency, and frugality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.
*   **Northstar Vision**: A clear, planted flag on a specific mission or goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Team Building**: The capacity to attract talented individuals even before securing investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Business Acumen**: Understanding numbers, projections, accounting, contracts, and overall business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Frugality**: Not wasting money, which signals responsible management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **Confidence and Clarity**: Crucial for resisting external opinions and maintaining a clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

### Capitalizing on Momentum and Market Timing

The company leveraged a single viral video into significant growth and investment interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. They recognized that the viral attention and investment opportunities were temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. In the unique "Founders Market" of AI, where investors are eager to get involved regardless of the business model (SaaS or agency), speed is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Giving up a bit more equity early for immediate capital was seen as acceptable to scale fast and avoid being outpaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

The sentiment is that the ease of getting AI investment is diminishing as more companies enter the space and failures accumulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. By late 2025, the market for AI investments is expected to become more competitive, shifting control to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

A guiding principle for them is Jeff Bezos' quote: "You need to be stubborn on your vision but very flexible on the details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. This means focusing on the ultimate goal and impact, rather than getting bogged down in early-stage negotiation details, as getting the "fuel" to grow the business is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

## Current Business and Market Potential

Currently, the company's focus is on "productizing the service" with a concept called "Agentago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Their strategy is to build custom "agentic operating systems" for various industries and departments, learn how to do it well, and potentially productize later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. This approach aims to bridge the "missing middle" challenge in sales, between small, easy projects and larger, more profitable but complex enterprise deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

They are standardizing their development process across different business functions (HR, sales, marketing, operations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. This standardization will enable them to create satellite websites and unique branding for specific use cases or industries, targeting niches more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. They are also exploring channel partners to sell these products while Custom AI Studio focuses on building, hosting, and managing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

A significant challenge in the market is communicating the value proposition of [[challenges_of_implementing_ai_agents | AI agents]] to non-technical business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. It's crucial to explain how AI can save time and provide ROI in understandable terms, such as by streamlining administrative tasks within business pillars like sales, operations, marketing, or HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>. Technical jargon and complex visual representations (like n8n nodes) can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

Currently, the AI agent market is seeing an "explosion of development tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Many startups initially aim to build "last-mile application layer products" but find it difficult and instead pivot to creating tools for developers, which is an easier market to penetrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This means fewer companies are pushing for the "true point" of AI agents – direct, end-user applications providing immediate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

The company's strategic investor is particularly interested in supporting entrepreneurs with smaller checks ($25K-$75K) to help them stand up businesses, with Custom AI Studio building the product for them to take to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. This positions them as an R&D arm, able to spin off products for other businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.

## What are AI Agents? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">00:06:20</a>
AI agents are Large Language Models (LLMs) that have the ability to take action. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">00:06:24</a> Unlike traditional chatbots that only process information and answer questions, agents can make decisions and then execute actions based on those decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">00:06:51</a> This is achieved by providing LLMs with "tools" and teaching them how to use them, thereby giving them agency. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">00:07:05</a>

AI agents are powerful because they can be embedded into nearly every aspect of a business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">00:07:22</a> They can operate activities, communicate with clients, extract revenue from dead lead lists, provide value, recruit and train team members, reduce scaling costs, and [[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | automate repetitive tasks]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">00:07:26</a>

The key takeaway is that AI agents can be embedded into every business aspect because all business functions involve collecting, sharing, manipulating, organizing, and sending information, which often consumes significant time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">00:14:10</a>

## Foundational Components for Building AI Agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">00:14:40</a>
Building reliable AI agents requires several key components:

1.  **Vector Database:** For agents to be reliable and reduce the need for new hires, they need up-to-the-minute contextual knowledge of your business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">00:14:56</a> A vector database is a three-dimensional database that relates "tokens" (four characters) by creating a vector (a number) for each, enabling relational value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">00:15:12</a> When files are added to a knowledge base for a chatbot or custom GPT, they are vectorized and stored in a vector database. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">00:15:51</a>
2.  **Data Capture and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Automations:** Automations are set up to capture all data flowing into and out of the business at every entry and exit point. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">00:16:16</a> This information is then added to the vector database to keep agents constantly updated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">00:16:25</a> RAG automations ensure agents can retrieve this information when needed, preventing nonsensical outputs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">00:16:32</a>
3.  **Tools:** An agent becomes an agent only when given tools; otherwise, it's just a chatbot or a "brain." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">00:16:48</a> Tools enable agents to complete tasks and workflows. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">00:16:57</a> Examples include tools for sending emails, creating calendar events, retrieving documents, updating tasks, searching the web, and scraping websites. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">00:17:30</a> Custom tools can be built for specific needs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">00:17:45</a>
4.  **Prompts:** Prompt engineering is crucial for agents, providing them with clear instructions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">00:17:51</a> Strong prompts include:
    *   A clear objective (e.g., "monitor this inbox"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">00:18:04</a>
    *   Context (role within the business, necessary contextual information). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">00:18:11</a>
    *   Specific instructions on how to perform the task. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">00:18:22</a>
    *   Output requirements. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">00:18:27</a>
    *   Examples, especially for content generation or email filtering. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">00:18:35</a>
5.  **Integrations:** Agents should be integrated with existing tech stacks, acting as glue between platforms and potentially replacing some over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">00:18:53</a> When building agents, consider: what data is needed, where it is located, where results should be outputted, and which APIs are needed for connection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">00:19:21</a> The process should mirror what a human would need to fulfill their job description. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">00:19:38</a>

## Platforms Used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">00:19:50</a>
The speaker uses three main no-code platforms to build agents, emphasizing simplicity and cost-effectiveness: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">00:19:53</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">00:20:30</a>

*   **OpenAI:** Primarily uses GPT-4o model due to its industry leadership and consistent innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">00:21:11</a> Costs are around $20/month plus usage, typically not exceeding $50/month. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">00:20:00</a>
*   **Pinecone:** Used for building vector databases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">00:22:02</a> It is free and reliable, though the speaker is open to switching if better alternatives emerge. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">00:22:09</a>
*   **Inad.in:** The primary platform for building agents and their tools. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">00:22:26</a> It allows for no-code automations to be packaged as tools for agents, providing flexibility and customization for unique workflows. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">00:22:31</a> Inad.in is considered robust with intuitive AI features, requiring a slight learning curve if familiar with platforms like Zapier or Make. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">00:23:04</a>

This approach aims to minimize complexity and cost, making AI agents accessible to a wider audience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">00:23:28</a> The speaker believes this [[impact_of_agentic_ai_on_business_automation | AI revolution is democratized]], allowing anyone to build agents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">00:20:46</a>

## AI Agents vs. Automations: Designing Your AI Agent Teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">00:23:41</a>
A common misunderstanding is that AI agents are just regular automations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">00:23:46</a> However, AI agents are more akin to virtual assistants; they are given a job description, instructions, and tools to accomplish multi-step tasks within a larger workflow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">00:23:52</a>

Instead of thinking in terms of individual tasks, one should think in terms of workflows. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">00:24:10</a> For example, "managing an inbox" is a workflow that breaks down into tasks like reading emails, categorizing, saving data, notifying, replying, and sending. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">00:24:52</a> To manage an inbox, an agent needs email tools (send, reply, get), database tools (update, get data), and calendar tools (get, create, update events). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">00:25:15</a> Prompts instruct the agent on how to use these tools for the workflow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">00:25:45</a>

### Building an AI Agent Team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">00:25:57</a>
Most jobs involve a series of ongoing, evolving workflows. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">00:26:03</a> While theoretically a single robust agent could manage an entire business, the technology is not yet advanced enough. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">00:26:10</a> Therefore, the current strategy involves building [[integrating_ai_agents_with_business_tools | AI agent teams]], where each agent is responsible for one specific workflow and is equipped with the necessary tools for that workflow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">00:26:24</a>

#### Example: Automated Lead Generation Team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">00:26:44</a>
To [[automating_business_processes_with_ai_agents | automate a marketing funnel and lead generation]], a human would capture lead information, research leads, follow up, qualify leads, and book calls. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">00:26:46</a> An AI agent team for this would consist of: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">00:27:17</a>

1.  **Lead Enrichment Agent:** Triggered when a new lead enters the CRM, this agent searches the web for information (e.g., LinkedIn profiles, company websites) and saves it to the CRM. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">00:27:42</a>
2.  **Lead Nurturing Agent:** Using the enriched lead information, this agent crafts and sends highly personalized messages, including relevant content pieces, case studies, and trainings, designed to resonate with the lead. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">00:27:54</a>
3.  **Inbox Management Agent:** Monitors the inbox for responses from leads and, upon receiving one, passes it to the qualification agent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">00:28:15</a>
4.  **Lead Qualification Agent:** Reads the incoming email, answers specific questions based on its knowledge base, and if the lead is qualified, checks the calendar for availability and books the meeting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">00:28:34</a>

In this example, the only human involvement is creating the initial funnel and content, and then conducting the final sales call. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">00:29:28</a> All nurturing, warming up, filtering, and booking of qualified leads are handled by the AI agent team. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">00:29:43</a> This addresses the common issue of lost revenue due to inability to stay on top of leads who need more warming up. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">00:30:15</a> AI agents offer a cheaper, 24/7, and often more reliable alternative to hiring SDRs or VAs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">00:30:57</a>

## The Mindset Shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">00:31:04</a>
The future of business scaling involves asking, "Can an agent do this?" before asking, "Who do I need to hire for this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">00:31:07</a> This shift acknowledges the high costs, time commitment, and management overhead associated with hiring new employees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">00:32:06</a> While many have explored new AI products, they often find them overhyped and under-delivering. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">00:32:27</a> The goal is to find straightforward, effective AI solutions that deliver significant profits at a low cost by saving time and enabling new initiatives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">00:32:51</a>

## Getting Started: Custom AI Agent Framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">00:33:15</a>
A custom AI agent framework is offered to help businesses [[business_application_and_integration_of_ai_agents | integrate AI tools into operational processes]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">00:33:17</a> This includes:

1.  **Building a Contextual Master Database:** A vector database that collects all incoming and outgoing business information, along with a knowledge base of current business data and 3-6 months of historical contextual information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">00:33:30</a>
2.  **Setting up Data Capture and RAG Automations:** These automations run 24/7, retrieving and adding information to the database, ensuring agents are always up-to-date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">00:33:49</a>
3.  **Building a Custom AI Agent:** A custom agent capable of reliably completing any specified workflow within the business (e.g., reaching out to podcast hosts, sending emails, scheduling appointments). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">00:34:09</a>

This initial setup includes a full vector database, data capture/RAG automations, and a custom agent with up to five tools. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">00:35:05</a> The value is estimated at $33,000 for a traditional developer, but offered at $2,750, primarily due to prior experience, no-code platforms, and a desire to make AI agents accessible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">00:35:14</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">00:35:30</a>

The entire custom agent build, testing, and handoff process takes about 30 days, which is significantly faster than traditional development. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">00:36:46</a> Ongoing support and maintenance for existing agents, including adding more tools, is available for $750/month. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">00:37:15</a> New agents are generally charged at $1,500 per agent, defined as an agent with up to five tools capable of accomplishing a complex workflow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">00:37:47</a>

## The Future with AI Agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">00:35:59</a>
The speaker strongly believes that within the next five years, all businesses will be supported and backed by AI agents, making it almost an inevitability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">00:36:02</a> This is seen as a pivotal moment where AI tools being built will not become obsolete with future model updates. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">00:36:31</a> The vision is for founders to potentially run single-person multi-million dollar companies with the support of AI agents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">00:37:30</a>

Automating enterprise processes, particularly with emerging technologies like [[Impact of Agentic AI on business automation | Agentic AI]], presents a unique set of challenges that echo lessons learned from the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) era of the 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. While the technology evolves, fundamental obstacles related to communication, client expectations, and organizational structure persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Lessons from the RPA Era (2014-2018)

During the rise of RPA, early implementers faced several significant hurdles:
*   **Overly Simplistic Expectations**
    *   Initial narratives suggested that "one robot can do the work of 4.2 people" due to factors like robots not sleeping or taking vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This led to an underestimation of the actual [[Challenges of implementing AI agents | complexity of deployment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   **Partial Automation & Human Integration**
    *   Automating workflows often resulted in a "defragmented" process, where only segments could be digitized (e.g., 40% of a workflow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>. The remaining human elements often struggled to understand their new roles alongside their "digital twin" colleagues, leading to difficulties in operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>.
*   **Legacy Systems and Data Complexity**
    *   Enterprises operate on a diverse and evolving mix of systems, including mainframes, COBOL, screen scraping, and Citrix environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>. This complexity meant that not all tasks were "nails" for the "hammer" of automation, making a simple API-based approach insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Reusability**
    *   Despite aspirations for reusable workflows or "app stores," in reality, every client process proved to be "special and different" due to their unique historical evolution, mergers, and varied software implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>. Reusing a complex RPA process, like absence management, was often harder than building a new one from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>.
*   **Extracting Subject Matter Expertise (SME)**
    *   Gaining accurate, detailed information from subject matter experts (SMEs) proved intensely difficult. SMEs often don't fully understand why certain information is requested or how their verbal descriptions translate into a configurable automation, leading to inaccuracies in solution design documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[35:47:00]</a>.

## Current Challenges with [[Impact of Agentic AI on business automation | Agentic AI]]

Many of these issues resurface with [[Automating business processes with AI agents | AI agent-based automation]], alongside new complexities:
*   **Information Overload and Communication Gaps**
    *   The rapid pace of AI development creates "anxiety and fear of missing out constantly" for professionals trying to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.
    *   There's a significant gap between AI experts and the general business audience; most people don't understand terms like "[[Designing and integrating AI agent teams to automate business functions | AI agent]]" or "agentic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Technology Hype Over Business Outcomes**
    *   New, "sexy shiny stuff" like [[Automating business processes with AI agents | AI agents]] can get a discussion started or even lead to an initial project based on "fear of missing out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. However, sustainable success depends on focusing on core business problems that keep clients "up at night" and lead to promotion (e.g., efficient operations, reduced churn, increased revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:44]</a>.
    *   > "all of the sexy stuff that you're playing with as far as [[Automating business processes with AI agents | AI agents]] if it can't if it can't address that and you can't speak that language first and then backward engineer into how AI can help you achieve that then then you're just pedaling the the you know sexy shiny stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>
*   **Democratization Narrative vs. Enterprise Reality**
    *   The perception that AI is "so easy" due to tools like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:32:00">[43:32:00]</a> and low-code/no-code platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:20:00">[43:20:00]</a> creates an expectation that complex solutions can be built quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:00">[43:47:00]</a>. This clashes with the reality that "building robust Enterprise grade and reliable systems is not [easy] and it never has been and it it likely never will be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>.
*   **Organizational Silos and "Functional Fiefdoms"**
    *   The tendency for enterprises to create specialized teams (e.g., Continuous Improvement, RPA Center of Excellence, Machine Learning team) that don't communicate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:18:00">[39:18:00]</a> will likely continue with LLM and [[Designing and integrating AI agent teams to automate business functions | Agentic AI]] Centers of Excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:00">[40:07:00]</a>. This isolation prevents the technology from working across all realities and achieving its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:21:00">[40:21:00]</a>.
*   **Disruption to Traditional BPO Models**
    *   The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry, traditionally based on Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) pricing, faces disruption as AI automation challenges its core model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>. Procurement processes still normalize bids based on headcount, making it difficult to introduce disruptive, non-FTE based solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:13:00">[46:13:00]</a>. Innovation and transformation within existing BPO contracts are difficult to incentivize and implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:10:00">[47:10:00]</a>.
*   **The "Dumpster Fire of Complexity"**
    *   Uncontrolled proliferation of thousands or millions of "little geniuses" (agents) within an organization, without proper coordination, could lead to significant technical debt and system breakdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:36:00">[50:36:00]</a>. This requires strong orchestration and a "wrapper" around the solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:08:00">[51:08:00]</a>.
*   **Client Expectations vs. Reality**
    *   Clients often have unrealistic expectations, believing AI can do "absolutely everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:01:00">[55:01:00]</a>. Consultants frequently must "sell them what they needed and not what they wanted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:16:00">[55:16:00]</a>, which involves walking away from unfeasible projects and educating clients on what is truly possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:52:00">[55:52:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges: A Path Forward

To navigate these challenges, a strategic approach focused on [[integrating_ai_tools_into_operational_processes | integrating AI tools into operational processes]] is crucial:
*   **Hybrid Solutions**
    *   The concept of a "hybrid" approach, combining world-class human talent (for human-in-the-loop, design context, support) with AI for automation (workflow, data analysis, content creation, autonomy), offers powerful solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.
*   **Process-Centric Approach**
    *   Automation initiatives should be seen as an "expansion in the process engineering world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:32:00">[51:32:00]</a>. The framework for successful implementation involves:
        *   **Simplify**: Re-engineer and simplify the process first before attempting to automate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:01:00">[52:01:00]</a>.
        *   **Automate**: Apply appropriate tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:08:00">[52:08:00]</a>.
        *   **Virtualize**: Tap into human or digital resources as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:14:00">[52:14:00]</a>.
        *   **Orchestrate**: Build in flexibility for continuous evolution and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:22:00">[52:22:00]</a>.
*   **Consultative Sales and Trust Building**
    *   Successful engagement requires a consultative sales approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:44:00">[55:44:00]</a>. It's about demonstrating respect for the client's expertise while bringing specialized knowledge in automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:19:00">[57:19:00]</a>. This builds trust, as clients recognize a partner who prioritizes their needs over simply making a sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:58:00">[55:58:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Business Outcomes**
    *   Ultimately, the goal is to address specific business needs such as talent shortages, inflation pressures, or improving efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:26:00">[56:26:00]</a>. The technology is a means to achieve these outcomes, not an end in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:18:00">[56:18:00]</a>.

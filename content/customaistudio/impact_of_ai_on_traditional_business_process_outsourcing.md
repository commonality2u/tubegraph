The landscape of business process outsourcing (BPO) and automation has seen significant evolution, with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) leading the charge in the 2010s, and [[business_application_and_integration_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] now ushering in a new era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This shift highlights a transition from rule-based automation to more intelligent and adaptive systems, presenting both opportunities and challenges for traditional BPO models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>.

## The RPA Era and its Parallels to AI

Ian, a leader in digital transformation with over 25 years of experience, was instrumental in the RPA movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. He notes strong similarities between the RPA era (2010s) and the current [[impact_of_agentic_ai_on_business_automation | AI agent]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### BPO and Automatable Tasks
Ian's background in the BPO industry involved building large offshore teams, often handling routine, mundane, and structured tasks that enterprises didn't consider strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This type of work provided a "perfect framework" for automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

In 2012, the concept of automation emulating human work emerged, leading to the application of RPA in BPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Ian's team at a billion-dollar call center company applied RPA to Dell's supply chain and logistics order management, which was one of the very first RPA applications in BPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This led to the establishment of the first RPA Center of Excellence (CoE) in BPO in Chennai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

### The Rise of RPA Consultancies
Companies began approaching BPO providers not just for cheap labor, but for expertise in the "robot thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. This demand led Ian and his partner to start an RPA consultancy in 2014, growing it to 300 consultants before selling it in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Their focus was on "masters of process" – the ability to assess operations, identify opportunities, and redesign processes for digitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.

## Communicating New Technologies: RPA to AI
A significant challenge in both the RPA and [[understanding_ai_for_enhancing_business_profits | AI for enhancing business profits]] spaces is the communication gap between early adopters ("geeks") and the general business public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

### Overcoming the "Hype and Noise"
Most people are too busy with their day jobs to keep up with the rapid pace of technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. While ChatGPT made AI concepts more accessible, most still don't understand terms like "AI agent" or "agentic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

The key to successful communication is to always connect the technology back to fundamental business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>:
*   What keeps them up at night? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>
*   What gets them promoted? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>
*   Focus on "more efficient operation," "reduction in churn," or "increase in Topline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

Selling shiny new tech might secure initial projects, but sustained success comes from focusing on solving day-to-day problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

## Business Models and Reusability

### Pricing Strategies
Initially, RPA consultancies priced their services on a "time and material" basis due to the novelty of the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. As experience grew, some adopted a "t-shirt model" (small, medium, large projects) to avoid lengthy effort estimations and build client trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.

Outcome-based pricing, though desired, is often difficult to implement due to:
*   Difficulty in isolating the specific impact of the solution from other client initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
*   Client reluctance to share internal metrics and concerns about being "fleeced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.
*   Lack of mutual trust between partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

### The Challenge of Reusability
Unlike traditional SaaS products that offer a standardized "vanilla" solution, RPA, and now [[automating_business_processes_with_ai_agents | AI agents]], face significant reusability challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>. Each enterprise is a unique "collection of its sort of evolution or evolutionary steps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>, with different tools, integrations, and historical decisions leading to infinite permutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>.

> "Could you out of the box pull out a an HR RPA process and use it for the next client it would almost be harder to edit an existing one than to build a new one from scratch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>.

While AI agents are expected to be more flexible and adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:38:00">[34:38:00]</a>, the complexity of enterprise systems (e.g., mainframes, Citrix, unstructured data) means that simple API-based automation is not always sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.

## AI's Impact and The Future of BPO: A Hybrid Model

### The "Tool" vs. "Partner" Mindset
Businesses must move beyond treating AI as just another tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:38:00">[38:38:00]</a>. A major pitfall seen with RPA was the creation of siloed Centers of Excellence (CoEs) (e.g., RPA CoE, ML team) that didn't communicate or integrate, leading to pilot projects that often died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:00">[39:05:00]</a>.

[[integrating_ai_tools_into_operational_processes | AI agents]] are uniquely positioned to work across various business realities – handling unstructured data, executing workflow steps, and providing insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:21:00">[40:21:00]</a>. To leverage this, organizations need a hybrid team and a bigger vision beyond functional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>.

### The Hybrid Solution
Ian believes in a hybrid model where the best of human talent is combined with the power of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. This means leveraging "world-class talent" for human-in-the-loop tasks, design context, and ongoing support, while AI handles everything from basic workflow automation to complex data analysis and content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.

> "If you combine those things you get some pretty powerful solutions that solve people's problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

Examples of where this hybrid approach is crucial include:
*   **Talent Acquisition and HR Processes**: While AI can streamline parts, human involvement is essential for sensitive tasks like onboarding and ongoing staff support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain and Logistics**: These processes still involve elements that require human oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>.
*   **Finance and Accounting**: Certain elements, like mortgage certifications in specific states, legally require human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:35:00">[26:35:00]</a>.

Clients, ultimately, don't care about the percentage of work done by AI versus human intelligence; they care about agreed-upon service levels and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>.

### The Future of BPO
Traditional BPO, defined by its FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) based pricing, is "set to be disrupted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:02:00">[46:02:00]</a>. This model struggles to compare and reward innovative, disruptive solutions offered by AI, as procurement processes normalize based on headcount cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:13:00">[46:13:00]</a>.

Ian is actively working on building a "new BPO" that combines "cutting-edge AI" with "world-class talent" and a commercial structure that "rewards innovation and evolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:42:00">[46:42:00]</a>. This is critical because incentives to transform solutions *after* they are sold have historically been absent in BPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:05:00">[47:05:00]</a>.

The concept of AI agents can be compared to "gig workers" for discrete tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>. The challenge lies in orchestrating these numerous "little Geniuses" within complex, slow-to-adapt organizations, emphasizing the need for a wrapping structure if not SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:58:00">[50:58:00]</a>.

> "It's going to need to be orchestrated in a way that that still has to have a rapper around it if it's not SAS it's something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:08:00">[51:08:00]</a>.

### Process Engineering and Managing Expectations
The emergence of [[the_role_of_ai_in_business_and_personal_life | AI]] and [[future_of_ai_and_human_integration_in_business | agentic AI]] is another expansion in the field of process engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>. Ian references the "SABO" framework from RPA days: Simplify, Automate, Virtualize, Orchestrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:00">[51:42:00]</a>. The AI era simply provides a much richer toolset for the "Automate" and "Virtualize" steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:41:00">[52:41:00]</a>.

A persistent challenge is that processes are "always way way more complicated than they say at the beginning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:44:00">[53:44:00]</a>. This often stems from an oversimplistic narrative around AI's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:04:00">[54:04:00]</a>. Consultants often need to sell clients "what they needed and not what they wanted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:16:00">[55:16:00]</a>, which requires educating them on realistic possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:52:00">[55:52:00]</a>. This consultative approach, where the provider is a "master of process" rather than an arrogant industry expert, is crucial for fostering trust and productive discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:19:00">[57:19:00]</a>.

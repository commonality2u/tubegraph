In a span of 60 days, a company specializing in AI agents completed over 26 projects, leading to significant growth and valuable insights into [[developing_ai_agents_and_their_market_potential | AI agent development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This period of intense activity revealed key learnings about business models, project delivery, and the practical application of AI agents in various business contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Rapid Growth in 60 Days
The company experienced rapid growth, particularly after a YouTube video titled "[[building_autonomous_ai_agents_over_18_months | 18 months of building autonomous AI agents]]" was posted on August 6th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This video garnered over 172,000 views and led to 37 intro calls booked in a single week, completely filling the company's calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

This surge in interest was attributed to striking a chord when the market was becoming increasingly aware of AI agents but lacked a clear understanding of their capabilities, limitations, and how to [[building_and_deploying_ai_agents | build and deploy them]] effectively in a business context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Team Expansion
Initially, the team consisted of two individuals, with one working full-time and the other part-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The sudden influx of projects necessitated a rapid team expansion to deliver projects in a timely manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Community Soft Launch
A community has been soft-launched, initially free for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This community will eventually include paid course modules and tutorials, offering deeper insights into the AI stack, RAG, and LLMs, as well as providing more resources, agent templates, and workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Evolving Tech Stack and Processes
The company's internal tech stack initially included Slack, Trello, Google Drive, Calendly, N8N, email, Google Meets, PandaDoc, and Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. To streamline operations, Slack, Trello, and Google Drive are being replaced with a centralized platform called Motion, which offers client portals for direct communication and integrated project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Streamlined Delivery Process
Recognizing the difficulty in accurately scoping [[ai_agent_architecture_and_scalability | AI agent systems]] due to research and development (R&D) and testing, a new process was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The focus shifted to delivering a proof of concept (POC) within 7 days of client sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This approach improves client relationships, provides early alignment on project direction, and allows for quick adjustments based on client feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### Sales and Marketing Funnel
The current sales and marketing funnel is simple, relying solely on organic content, primarily from YouTube and LinkedIn, with no cold email campaigns or ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Interested parties are directed to a landing page where they can join the community or book a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The typical sales process involves one or two calls to understand client needs and project complexity, aiming for a swift decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

*   **Lead Nurturing Agent:** Schedules daily or every-five-day checks to pull leads from HubSpot that haven't been contacted, retrieves message history for context, and uses an email writer agent (trained on user's sent emails) to draft and send follow-up emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
*   **Voice Agents:** Highly impressive voice reception, after-hours call service, and voice call sales trainer agents capable of complex actions like transferring calls, seeking human assistance, or generating and sending reports during a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

## Common Patterns and Learnings in Agent Development

### Popularity of RAG Agents
A predominant pattern observed is the request for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agents, where clients want to feed specific data (e.g., sales call transcripts, emails, company wikis) into a vector database for an agent to access and analyze using natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. Once a RAG agent is established, clients often want to build additional capabilities on top, such as sending emails, updating project management software, or creating marketing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

### Working with LLMs and Ensuring Reliability
There's inherent friction between traditional deterministic software development and the non-deterministic nature of LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Key tips for building more reliable agents include:
*   **Plain Text Conversion:** Convert all text to plain text before sending it to an LLM, avoiding stringification, for better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
*   **Error Handling in Multi-Agent Systems:** For multi-agent systems or agents with many tools, assume that the LLM might mess up 3-5% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Instead of traditional error handling (which requires manual fixes), enable the agent to "talk back and forth" with the tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. If an agent sends an empty query parameter, the tool can respond, "What you sent me was empty; please try again," allowing the agent to self-correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Business Model for AI Agent Delivery

The company's business model is evolving to support different client needs:

1.  **AI Agent Development Partner:** The primary offering, moving away from one-time builds due to scoping difficulties and "scope creep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. This model involves being a long-term development partner, providing dedicated AI agent developers on a month-to-month flat rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. This allows for continuous building, maintenance, and application of new learnings to client systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.
2.  **Hosted Agents:** Offers pre-built agents that can be quickly implemented into client systems with minimal configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. These agents are hosted, managed, and maintained by the company for an initial implementation cost and a small monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.
3.  **SaaS Products:** Exploring the development of traditional self-service SaaS products for specific, single-use case agent systems or niche markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.
4.  **Community:** A platform for discussion and sharing ideas, offering paid educational content, new learnings, and tutorials on advanced topics like multi-agent systems, consistent output, tool calling, and [[ai_agent_frameworks_and_platforms | AI agent frameworks]] like OpenAI Swarm vs. LangChain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
5.  **Affiliate Fees and YouTube Ads:** Additional revenue streams from affiliate links and YouTube advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

## Roadmap and Future Vision

The company aims for an exponential impact on the AI space, with a Northstar vision of building systems that enable the creation of the first "one-person billion-dollar company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. This goal is seen as achievable by 2026-2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

The development of AI agents is still new, with no definitive "right answer" or established playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>. The company aims to contribute to creating this playbook by continually experimenting with new tools and [[ai_agent_architecture_and_scalability | architectural approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

The evolution of foundational models like GPT-4 and the advent of GPT-4o (O1, which provides improved reasoning for GPT-4) and OpenAI Swarm, which guarantee structured outputs and improved function calling, are crucial for increasing agent reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. The direction of major LLM players, especially OpenAI, indicates a clear move towards providing the necessary tools for [[building_and_deploying_ai_agents | building AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>. The challenge then becomes practically implementing these tools into business environments to provide significant leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

[[introduction_to_prompt_engineering | Prompt engineering]] is often seen as an overused term in the AI space, with some marketers pushing it excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, there is genuine merit to it, as it involves an "engineering aspect" similar to software engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Just as software engineering involves writing precise instructions in a different language for a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, prompt engineering is about telling an AI system what to do, primarily using natural language like English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Language as the Core of Prompt Engineering

The effectiveness of [[introduction_to_prompt_engineering | prompt engineering]] hinges on the clarity and specificity of the language used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Individuals who are better at speaking and reading English tend to be better at asking questions and extracting the needed answers from AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This means that while speaking a language doesn't automatically make one an "elite prompt engineer," there is a definite skill in crafting effective prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

At its core, [[introduction_to_prompt_engineering | prompt engineering]] is "just telling the agent what to do, who it is, and how to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This involves giving the AI instructions, providing context, and showing it how to perform its job, sometimes including examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Components of an Effective Prompt Formula

A successful [[introduction_to_prompt_engineering | prompt engineering]] formula typically includes:

### Objective
The prompt should begin with a clear and specific overall objective for the [[building_efficient_ai_agents_with_prompts | AI agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This objective defines the main task or goal the agent needs to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. For example, a calendar agent's objective is to parse user input, identify event-related information, and generate a JSON package with correct parameters for calendar operations, focusing solely on event management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Context
This section provides comprehensive background information to the [[building_efficient_ai_agents_with_prompts | AI agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. It includes details about the user's situation, relevant databases, and other information that helps the agent better understand its role and specific scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Context is crucial because it allows the prompt engineer to emphasize the importance of certain actions. For instance, using phrases like "you must output in all caps" or dramatically stating "if you don't output in all caps, our entire business is ruined," can prompt the AI to take instructions more seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This highlights how language can influence the AI's "reasoning" and adherence to instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### Instructions
These are step-by-step guidelines on exactly what the [[building_efficient_ai_agents_with_prompts | AI agent]] should be doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. For a calendar agent, instructions might include:
*   Identify the calendar action (e.g., create, delete, get, update) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   Extract specific event information from the user's message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   Retrieve necessary information (like email addresses) from a [[data_management_and_prompt_engineering_for_ai_agents | database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   Generate a JSON output with the correct parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Output Requirements
This section specifies the format and content the [[building_efficient_ai_agents_with_prompts | AI agent]] should output once its work is completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This is critical for ensuring the output can be used by subsequent steps or nodes in an automation workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Often, this requires output in a specific format like a JSON package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The AI takes in information, identifies what needs to happen, and outputs the data in the required format for the next step to finish the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Examples
Providing as many real-world examples as possible is vital for consistent output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Examples should include various scenarios and even edge cases that might occur, as they significantly improve the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Consistent output is especially important when [[building_efficient_ai_agents with prompts | AI agents]] are integrated into business processes and relied upon over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Practical Application: Calendar Management with AI Agents

An example of [[introduction_to_prompt_engineering | prompt engineering]] in action is an [[building_efficient_ai_agents_with_prompts | AI agent]] designed to manage a user's calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. When given a command like "create a meeting for Thursday at 5:00 p.m. and add Andrew Lewis to it," the prompt guides the AI to:
*   Understand "Thursday at 5:00 p.m." (even though the model was trained up to 2023 and doesn't know current dates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Retrieve Andrew Lewis's email from a [[data_management_and_prompt_engineering_for_ai_agents | vector store database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Identify the action as "create an event" from a switch function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Output the result in a specific JSON format, which the agent can then interpret as a success message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

The [[building_efficient_ai_agents_with_prompts | AI agent]] must be able to parse complex natural language inputs, like "send Andrew an email asking if he has finished the project proposal for our call with John on Friday and schedule a meeting with him 30 minutes before the call with John and call it like team sync" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The agent needs to extract the relevant calendar action (scheduling a meeting) while ignoring unrelated parts (sending an email, which would be handled by a different tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This showcases the [[challenges_in_ai_prompt_engineering_and_development | challenges in AI prompt engineering and development]] and the necessity of carefully crafted prompts for modularity and specific task execution.

## Leveraging Custom GPTs for Prompt Generation

To streamline the [[introduction_to_prompt_engineering | prompt engineering]] process, custom GPTs can be used as prompt generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. These tools, like a custom [[leveraging_ai_like_chatgpt_to_handle_specific_tasks | ChatGPT]] for prompt generation, can provide a structured outline for prompts, including objective, context, instructions, and output requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. While the user still needs to input specific details and refine the prompt, these generators provide a foundational template that adheres to the established principles of effective [[prompt_engineering_and_modularity_in_ai_systems | prompt engineering and modularity in AI systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. The better the initial prompt given to the generator, the better the prompt it will create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Ultimately, [[introduction_to_prompt_engineering | prompt engineering]] boils down to providing clear instructions to [[building_efficient_ai_agents_with_prompts | AI agents]] using language, often leveraging templates or custom tools to ensure consistency and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

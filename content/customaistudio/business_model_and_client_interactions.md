This article details the evolution of a custom AI studio's [[business_models_and_pricing_for_automation_technologies | business model]] and its approach to client interactions, following a period of significant growth.

## Rapid Growth and Team Expansion
The company experienced substantial growth, completing over 26 AI agent projects in 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. This surge was primarily driven by a YouTube video posted on August 6th, which garnered 172,000 viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. The video led to 37 intro calls booked in one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

Initially, the team consisted of only two people, with one working full-time and the other part-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Due to the high demand, the team rapidly expanded to quickly deliver projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>, with more people joining monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

## Streamlining Operations and Client Delivery
To manage the increased workload and improve client experience, the company streamlined its internal processes and tech stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Initial Tech Stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>
> *   Slack for client communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>
> *   Trello for project tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>
> *   Google Drive for file storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>
> *   Calendly for scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>
> *   n8n for building automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>
> *   Google Meets for calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>
> *   PandaDoc for contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>
> *   Stripe for payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>

The company moved to centralize its operations into a single platform called Motion, aiming to replace Slack, Trello, and Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. This new platform provides each client with their own portal, enabling direct communication between developers and clients and centralizing all project-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

### Proof of Concept (POC) Approach
A key change in the delivery process is the focus on quickly developing a Proof of Concept (POC) within 7 days of a client signing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. This approach aims to:
*   Improve client relationships by demonstrating active work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.
*   Align expectations between the client and the development team regarding the build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.
*   Allow for early feedback and adjustments, as clients often realize new possibilities or limitations upon seeing the POC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

## Sales and Marketing Funnel
The company's [[business_application_and_integration_of_ai_agents | business]] acquisition relies on a simple funnel primarily driven by organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **Organic Content:** The main source of leads is organic content, predominantly through YouTube and LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. No cold email campaigns or ads are currently running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
*   **Landing Page:** Interested parties are funneled to a landing page with two main calls to action:
    *   Join the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.
    *   Book a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
*   **Client Calls:**
    *   Often, a single intro call is sufficient for clients who understand AI agents and need building services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
    *   For more complex, multi-step workflows requiring extensive integrations, a follow-up call is common to gather granular details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.
    *   The goal is to close the deal by the follow-up call, though third or fourth calls sometimes occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

## Diverse Client Base
The company has engaged with a wide range of clients and partners across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>:
*   Solo Founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>
*   Startup Teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>
*   Small Businesses (Online Services, Professional Services, Home Services like roofers and construction companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>
*   Investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>
*   Publicly Traded Companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>
*   Mid-Market Companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>
*   Big Four Consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>
*   Channel Partners (e.g., businesses selling CRM sub-accounts to specific niches like landscaping, interested in reselling AI agent capabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>
*   Developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>
*   Job Seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>

## Service Offerings
The company offers several distinct services that blend [[balancing_agency_and_saas_models_in_ai_solutions | agency]] and [[historical_context_and_evolution_of_saas_models | SaaS]] models to cater to different client needs.

### 1. AI Agent Development Partner (Agency Model)
This is the primary offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>, moving away from one-time builds due to challenges in scoping and managing scope creep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>.
*   **Model:** Functions as an extension of the client's team, serving as their [[business_application_and_integration_of_ai_agents | AI agent]] development partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>.
*   **Service:** Continuously builds and maintains bespoke AI agent systems over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. This allows the company to apply new learnings and improvements to client builds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>.
*   **Staffing:** Clients receive a dedicated AI agent developer (or multiple, depending on hours needed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:19:00">[32:19:00]</a>.
*   **[[business_models_and_pricing_for_automation_technologies | Pricing]]:** A flat monthly rate based on the allocated developer hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:42:00">[32:42:00]</a>.

### 2. Hosted Agents (Hybrid Model)
This model focuses on leveraging pre-built agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>.
*   **Service:** Pre-built agents are quickly implemented into client systems with minimal configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>. The company handles hosting, management, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>. This includes setting up databases, integrations, data flow, and assisting with prompt creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a>.
*   **[[business_models_and_pricing_for_automation_technologies | Pricing]]:** An initial implementation cost followed by a small monthly fee for continuous maintenance and model updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:28:00">[33:28:00]</a>.
*   **Benefit:** Offers a more hands-on approach than a pure [[historical_context_and_evolution_of_saas_models | SaaS]] product, allowing direct client interaction for support and customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>.

### 3. SaaS Products
The company is exploring the development of traditional, self-service [[historical_context_and_evolution_of_saas_models | SaaS]] products for single-use case agent systems or specific niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:49:00">[34:49:00]</a>. This is currently an experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:22:00">[35:22:00]</a>.

### 4. Community
A soft-launched community serves as a platform for discussion, sharing ideas, and providing educational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>.
*   **Content:** Will feature course modules on AI fundamentals (e.g., RAG, LLM mechanics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, new learnings on multi-agent systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:53:00">[36:53:00]</a>, agent reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:59:00">[36:59:00]</a>, tool calling, and choice of [[integrating_ai_agents_with_business_tools | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a>.
*   **[[business_models_and_pricing_for_automation_technologies | Pricing]]:** Currently free for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>, with plans for paid access once tutorial and course videos are released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. More resources, agent templates, and workflows will be added for community members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

## Vision and Roadmap
The company's Northstar is to contribute to creating the first "one-person billion-dollar company" by developing the necessary systems and playbooks for practical [[aipowered_business_strategies | AI implementation]] in businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>. This vision is supported by the ongoing advancements from large LLM players like OpenAI, which are increasingly providing tools conducive to agent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:02:00">[41:02:00]</a>. The focus is on understanding how to effectively use these tools to achieve 10x to 1000x leverage on employees or the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>, creating a reliable playbook for [[mapping_workflows_to_achieve_business_outcomes | integrating AI agents into any business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:00">[42:24:00]</a>.

> *   **Non-Determinism of LLMs:** Acknowledge that LLMs are not fully deterministic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>. Instead of forcing deterministic behavior, design systems that work with their inherent nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>.
> *   **Plain Text Input:** Convert text to plain text before sending it to an LLM for better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>.
> *   **Natural Language Error Handling:** In multi-agent systems, instead of traditional error handling, allow agents to communicate back and forth with tools in natural language to resolve issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>. Assume agents might make errors 3-5% of the time, and build in mechanisms for them to self-correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>.
> *   **RAG as a Starting Point:** Many clients initially request Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agents to speak to or analyze their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>. Once data pipelines are established, this opens up numerous possibilities for building additional capabilities on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.

Identifying impactful [[implementing_and_utilizing_ai_agent_tools_for_various_business_operations | AI use cases]] for business operations can be achieved through a six-step process, focusing on tasks that AI, such as ChatGPT, can perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Step 1: Write Down Your Operational Business Outcomes
Begin by listing your key operational business outcomes, which are typically Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These are the levers you aim to improve to enhance the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Examples:
*   **Sales Team (SDR/SCR role)**:
    *   Book 30 meetings per month with qualified leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   For five SCRs, aim for 150 booked meetings per month, resulting in 50 closed deals at a 30% close rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Sales Director**:
    *   Close $325K combined revenue per month (e.g., $125K new business, $200K renewals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Content Marketing**:
    *   Generate 7,500 warm leads via video organic content on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   These leads convert to 150 booked meetings (2% conversion rate), leading to 50 closed deals (30% conversion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Sales Operations**:
    *   Increase sales team ROI by 1% monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Decrease unqualified leads in CRM through lead scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   Maintain CRM [[data_management_and_prompt_engineering_for_ai_agents | data hygiene]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   Increase sales efficiency by removing bottlenecks and introducing new tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   Track team productivity and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Step 2: List Workflows Contributing to Each Outcome
For each identified outcome, list all the workflows that contribute to its achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. These can include daily routines or reminder settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. More detail in this step is always better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Examples:
*   **SDR**: Ensure leads are qualified, decrease no-shows, prepare sales directors, follow up until close (won or lost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Content Marketing**: Competitor research, trend tracking, consistent high-volume posting, value posting, lead magnets, content calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Step 3: Break Down Each Workflow into a Series of Tasks
Break down each workflow into individual tasks, detailing them by input data type and description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This step is crucial for understanding how AI can integrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

For each task, define:
*   **Input Data Type and Description**: What data is received (e.g., an email from a customer requesting X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Instructions**: The decision tree or steps to take based on the input data (e.g., if a customer requests a refund, first check for technical issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Avoid getting too granular with every edge case initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Platforms Used and Reason**: Which tools are used (e.g., HubSpot for CRM, Gmail for email, Google Drive for SOPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Identify how many different locations a person has to visit to complete a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Estimated Time to Complete**: Time taken for each unit and the overall task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Person(s) Involved**: The individual(s) and their role in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Volume of Executions**: How many times the task is performed per day, week, month, or year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Success Metrics**: Any KPIs associated with the task itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Step 4: Identify Tasks AI (ChatGPT) Could Do
Once you have a comprehensive list of tasks, identify those that ChatGPT could perform if provided with the correct context and all necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This step aims to pinpoint opportunities for removing operational bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

*   If a task involves copying and pasting information (e.g., documents, emails) into ChatGPT to get a reliable job done, it's an **[[automating_business_processes_with_ai_agents | AI opportunity]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Step 5: Automate Using Integration Platforms
While ChatGPT is a common entry point for AI, the next step is to use an integration platform like [[building_ai_agents_with_n8n | n8n]] to "glue it all together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

*   For instance, if ChatGPT is to field customer emails, it needs access to the inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Relying on manual copy-pasting of tickets into ChatGPT by an offshore team and then pasting responses back is inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Instead, use a tool like [[building_ai_agents_with_n8n | n8n]] to automate the entire process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This [[implementing_and_utilizing_ai_agent_tools_for_various_business_operations | automation]] makes the process simple and automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

When seeking funding for an AI-driven business, founders face a crucial decision: whether to pursue traditional venture capitalists (VCs) and private equity (PE) groups or opt for strategic partners. The founders of Custom AI Studio, an AI agent company, shared their journey and the rationale behind choosing a strategic partner for their funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The Funding Dilemma: Strategic Partners vs. Traditional VCs

Traditional Private Equity groups and VCs differ in fundamental ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. VCs are often focused on the immediate bottom line and quarterly growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. While their money is needed and appreciated, they may not provide the desired level of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Their mindset tends to be fixed on a SaaS model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

Custom AI Studio chose a different approach, prioritizing a strategic partner who shared their vision over a large VC firm that might offer substantial capital but lack support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This partner genuinely believes in their work and vice versa, fostering a unique level of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This strategic partner understands that as a newer business, things take time and offers support rather than constant pressure for quarterly growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Custom AI Studio's Journey to Funding

### Initial AI Business Endeavors
After the release of ChatGPT, the founders decided to start an AI company, recognizing it as "the next big thing" that would "change everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. With no technical background, they initially partnered with development firms in Israel, India, and Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Their initial focus was on building a SaaS product, as it offered the best multiples, valuations, and investor excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

They developed several SaaS products, including:
*   A research report writing agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   A semantic search tool for retrieving documents, with use cases in healthcare records and legal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   A chatbot to interact with 10K SEC filings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

These SaaS ventures, however, did not gain significant traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Building a SaaS product requires substantial upfront capital for development, market share acquisition, and cash flow for reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The rapid evolution of AI models posed a significant risk, as new features from major players like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google could quickly render their products obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This led to the conclusion that a SaaS bet was too risky at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Transition to an Agency Model
The company shifted to an [[balancing_agency_and_saas_models_in_ai_solutions | agency model]], offering broad [[AIpowered_business_strategies | AI solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This approach allowed them to:
*   **Generate cash flow:** To reinvest and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Increase building "reps":** To become proficient at creating AI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Gain market insights:** By working on diverse projects in various industries, they developed a unique pulse on market needs, making future SaaS building less risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

This agency work helped them realize that [[differences_between_ai_agents_and_traditional_automation | AI agents]], particularly agentic workflows using APIs for reasoning and content generation, represented the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. They "planted a flag on AI agents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### The Decision to "Go Big" and Seek Fuel
After gaining significant traction, including a viral YouTube video that brought in 26 projects and increased cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, they reached a growth limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. They faced a choice: build a slow-growing lifestyle business or "go big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Opting to go big meant seeking capital to fund operations, infrastructure, sales, and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Their options for funding included:
*   Strategic investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>
*   Angel investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>
*   VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>
*   Private Equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>
*   Friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>
*   Crypto tokens (a model offering tokens and taking a percentage of gas fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>
*   Crowdsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>
*   Continued bootstrapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>

They chose the strategic route for several reasons:
*   Ability to meet in person easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
*   Access to advice and resources from partners who had built a similar business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   Knowledge and experience in managing overseas talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   Their agency model was better suited for strategic partners who understood a discovery phase rather than a rigid SaaS-only mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## Pitching Investors for an AI-Driven Business

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>
> Investors want their foot in the door and they don't want to do the work. And what they're looking for is an operator.

Investors are seeking an "engine" â€” an operator who is obsessed with the AI space, focused on growth, and committed to building something regardless of external funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. They want to outsource the effort of staying updated, exploring technology, troubleshooting, and managing the complexities of AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

### Key Qualities Investors Seek:
*   **Focus and Obsession:** A deep dedication to the AI space and the company's vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   **Operator Mentality:** The ability to get things done, focus on systems, operations, efficiency, and frugality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
*   **Northstar Vision:** A clear flag planted on what the company aims to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Team Building:** Demonstrating the ability to attract and retain talented people, even before investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Business Acumen:** Understanding how to grow a business, manage finances, and build performas and projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Frugality:** Being mindful of spending and understanding numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **Confidence and Clarity:** Essential for maintaining direction amidst various opinions and avoiding the pursuit of "shiny objects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

### Capitalizing on Momentum and Strategic Flexibility
The founders leveraged momentum from a viral video to attract investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. They recognized that investor interest in an agency model was unique to the current AI market, as people simply wanted involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

They believed that speed was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Getting "fuel" now to invest in infrastructure and scale was more critical than lengthy negotiations over equity splits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>
> Jeff Bezos: "You need to be stubborn on your vision but very flexible on the details."

This means focusing on the ultimate goal and impact rather than getting caught up in the minutiae of terms, especially in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Getting the necessary capital allows the business to "go figure it out later" through gaining knowledge, experience, and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

## Process for Securing Investment
1.  **Identify market approach:** In their case, AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.
2.  **Find lighthouse customers/clients:** Do free or very cheap work to build initial projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
3.  **Create proof of value:** Showcase successful projects and customer testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
4.  **Build traction:** Continuously engage on platforms like LinkedIn, acquire more customers, and build a catalog of case studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
5.  **Develop a unique perspective:** Plant a flag on a clear mission and "have a take" on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
6.  **Share openly:** Leverage content platforms (like YouTube) to showcase work and build credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. This established credibility allowed investors to approach them, rather than the founders chasing investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.
7.  **Create a market of interested investors:** Engage with multiple interested parties to create leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.
8.  **Define investment needs:** Clearly articulate where the money will go and how much is needed, taking control of the terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.
9.  **Ensure intangibles are present:** Display focus, confidence, and business acumen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.
10. **Don't get caught up in details:** Avoid prolonged negotiations that could cause the opportunity to be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

## Current Market Dynamics for AI Investments
The speaker notes that the current "Founders Market" for AI investments is not likely to last long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. By the end of 2025 (or even summer), the ease of securing investment for AI businesses will likely diminish as more people enter the space, failures increase, and investors become more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

## Business Model and Client Interactions
Custom AI Studio's current [[business_model_and_client_interactions | business model]] involves productizing their service, building "agentic operating systems" that are custom versions of a standard model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. The aim is to work with clients across various industries and departments to refine their building process, potentially leading to a platform or SaaS later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

The company encountered a "missing middle" challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>:
*   **Small, easy projects:** Often low-hanging fruit but less profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>.
*   **Larger, profitable projects:** Harder to acquire due to longer sales cycles and requirements for credentials and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

Their pricing strategy, which involves showing prices upfront, is partly designed to filter out clients who lack the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

When discussing [[understanding_ai_for_enhancing_business_profits | AI in Legal Firms and Cost Efficiency]] or other business applications, the emphasis should be on the return on investment (ROI) and how the AI system directly provides value to the business, rather than focusing on the technology itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

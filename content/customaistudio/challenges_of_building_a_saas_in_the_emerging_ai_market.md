Building a Software as a Service (SaaS) product in the rapidly evolving AI market presents unique and significant challenges, particularly for early-stage companies. Despite the inherent advantages of the SaaS model, such as favorable multiples and valuations from investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, the volatility and speed of the AI landscape necessitate a flexible and strategic approach.

## Early Attempts and Lessons Learned

Initially, the goal was to build a SaaS product, driven by the perceived benefits of the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. As the founders were not technical, they partnered with development firms in Israel, India, and Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. Several SaaS products were attempted:

*   **Research Report Writing Agent**: A SaaS product was developed and sent to friends in finance, investment banking, private equity, and law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This effort failed to gain traction, with half the friends ignoring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Semantic Search for Documents**: Another attempt involved retrieving documents via semantic search, with use cases in healthcare records and legal documents. While "ahead of its time," it would have required too much "lift" (effort/resources) to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   **10K SEC Filings Chatbot**: A chatbot designed to interact with SEC filings was built, targeting finance professionals who frequently sift through these documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. This also met with "crickets" and minimal interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

These early failures highlighted fundamental challenges with the pure SaaS model in this nascent market.

## Core Challenges

### High Upfront Capital and Market Share Acquisition
Building a successful SaaS product requires significant upfront capital, not only for development but also for gaining market share and acquiring subscribers. Startups in this sector often operate "in the red" for years, solely focused on building their Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

### Rapid Technological Obsolescence and Risk
The most critical challenge identified was the extreme pace of innovation in AI. Major players like ChatGPT, Claude, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google can release improved models or features that can "wipe out whatever we just built" within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. This rapid evolution means that even simple "GPT wrappers" (products built solely on top of existing Large Language Models) are easily rendered obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. This inherent risk made betting on a traditional SaaS model "probably not the right move" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Risk of Obsolescence
> "The next month Chad gbt Claude or I mean anthropic could or like open AI or anthropic or Google whoever come out with an improved model or a feature to their thing that just wipes out whatever we just built." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>

### Developer Tooling vs. Last-Mile Applications
There is currently an explosion of AI agent development tools being funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. Many startups initially aim to build "last-mile application layer" products with direct ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. However, they soon realize the difficulty of achieving this and pivot to creating tools for developers, which is an "easy route" to gain market share among active AI developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. This means fewer companies are pushing forward on the "true point" of AI – the direct application layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.

### Investor Mindset
While investors are eager to get involved in the AI space and seek an "engine" (an obsessed operator) to lead the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>, many still default to a SaaS mindset. Venture Capital (VC) firms, even when excited, often expect a future transition to a SaaS model, picking a niche and vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. This limited flexibility can be a challenge for companies needing to remain agile during a discovery phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>.

> Investors "just want to get involved they want their foot in the door and they don't want to do the work and what they're looking for is an operator." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>

## Shifting to an Agency Model

Due to these challenges, the decision was made to shift from a pure SaaS focus to an agency model offering broad AI solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This strategic pivot allowed the company to:

*   **Generate Cash Flow**: Vital for reinvestment and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.
*   **Increase Reps/Skill Building**: Continuously improve at building systems, prompting LLMs, and navigating the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.
*   **Gain Market Pulse**: Engage with hundreds of entrepreneurs, engineers, and executives, working on dozens of projects across various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. This provided a unique understanding of real-world use cases, user understanding of AI, and desired ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.
*   **De-risk Future SaaS Decisions**: The insights gained from the agency model made building a future SaaS product "way less risky" by informing genuine market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

### Current Business Model
The current model involves focusing on "agentic operating systems" – custom AI agent solutions that can be tailored for various industries and departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>. The approach is to "productize the service," learning to build well before potentially evolving into a platform player or SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:00">[39:05:00]</a>. This flexibility is key, as a direct jump to SaaS is considered "kind of dumb" in this rapidly evolving space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:28:00">[39:28:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[current_trends_in_ai_agent_platforms | challenges of implementing AI agents]] and building SaaS in the emerging AI market highlight the need for adaptability and a keen understanding of market dynamics. The rapid pace of technological advancements means that companies must prioritize gaining experience and market insight, even if it means deferring the traditional SaaS model. The strategic partner approach, valuing support and shared vision over sheer capital, proved more effective in navigating this complex and fast-moving environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This flexible strategy allows the company to develop [[developing_ai_agents_and_their_market_potential | AI agents]] while continuously learning and de-risking future product decisions.

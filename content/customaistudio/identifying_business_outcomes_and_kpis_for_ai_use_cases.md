This article outlines a six-step process to quickly identify the most impactful [[understanding_ai_for_enhancing_business_profits | AI use cases]] for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This blueprint helps in [[blueprint_for_integrating_ai_into_business | integrating AI into business]] operations.

## Step 1: Write Down Operational Business Outcomes

The first step is to document your operational business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These are typically Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These are the crucial levers you aim to improve to enhance the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Examples of outcomes and KPIs:

*   **Sales Team (e.g., for an SCR role)**:
    *   Book 30 meetings per month with qualified leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   If there are five SCRs, aim for 150 booked meetings per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
    *   Achieve 50 closed deals at a 30% close rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Sales Director**:
    *   Close \$325K combined revenue per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   This revenue might be broken down into \$125K from new business and \$200K from renewals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Content Marketing**:
    *   Generate 7,500 warm leads through video organic content on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   These warm leads should convert to 150 booked meetings at a 2% conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   Result in 50 closed deals (at a 30% conversion rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Sales Operations (Sales Ops)**:
    *   Increase the ROI of the sales team by 1% every month (12% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Decrease the number of unqualified leads in the CRM using lead scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   Maintain CRM data hygiene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   Focus on increasing sales efficiency by removing bottlenecks and introducing new tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   Track team productivity and growth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Improved reporting and lead scoring can lead to more time spent on good leads, making it easier for an SCR to meet their quota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Step 2: List Workflows Contributing to Each Outcome

Once the outcomes are defined, list all the workflows that contribute to achieving each outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. These can be daily workflows or reminder settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Examples of workflows:

*   **STR**: Ensure leads are qualified, decrease no-show rates, prepare the sales director, and follow up on deals until they are closed (won or lost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. More detail is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Content Marketing**: Competitor research, trend tracking, consistent high-volume posting, value posting, creating lead magnets, and managing a content calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Sales Ops**: A similar list to the one outlined in Step 1 for their outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Step 3: Break Down Each Workflow into a Series of Tasks

This step involves breaking down each broad workflow into specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. When doing so, consider the following details for each task:

*   **Input Data Type and Description**: What data is coming in? For example, an email from a customer in CRM requesting specific information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. A customer service representative might pull up the customer's record to understand their history (e.g., 11 meetings last week) or identify if they are a new lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Instructions Based on Input Data**: Define the decision tree or process. For instance, if a customer requests a refund, first check if it's a technical issue that can be troubleshooted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Avoid going too deep into every possible edge case at this stage, as processes can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Platforms Used and for What Reason**: Identify the tools involved. A customer support rep might use HubSpot (CRM), Gmail (to respond), and Google Drive (to find SOPs) to generate a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Estimated Time to Complete**: Estimate the time for each task, even on a unit-by-unit scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. For example, how long does it take to prospect a single person within the prospecting workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>? Breaking down a "post YouTube video" workflow might involve microtasks like writing content, creating a deck, setting up OBS, editing, and posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Person(s) Involved and Their Role**: Identify who is responsible for each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Volume of Executions**: How often is this task performed (per day, week, hour, month, or year)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>
*   **Success Metrics**: Are there KPIs associated with this specific task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>? While main success metrics often come from workflows, identifying how "well" a task is done can be valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Step 5: Identify Tasks for AI Automation

With a detailed list of tasks now available, identify which tasks could be performed by AI, such as ChatGPT, if given the right context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The goal is to begin the process of removing bottlenecks within the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. If a task could be done by AI simply by copying and pasting information (like documents or emails) into it, then it represents an [[the_role_of_ai_in_business_and_personal_life | AI opportunity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

While ChatGPT is a common access point for [[the_role_of_ai_in_business_and_personal_life | AI]], it's beneficial to go a step further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Instead of manually copying and pasting information, consider using a platform like n8n to "glue it all together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This allows for automation, enabling the AI (Large Language Model or LLM) to directly access necessary information (e.g., an inbox to field customer emails) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This moves beyond a custom GPT setup where an offshore team copies tickets into ChatGPT and pastes responses back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Instead, leverage platforms for [[implementing_and_utilizing_ai_agent_tools_for_various_business_operations | AI agent tools]] and [[understanding_and_implementing_ai_agents_in_businesses | AI agents]] to make the process automatic, representing a significant step in [[business_application_and_integration_of_ai_agents | business application and integration of AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

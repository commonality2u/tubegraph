Trejan, founder and AI growth expert at Infinitex AAI, specializes in helping companies scale efficiently through advisory training and [[ai_implementation_strategies | AI-driven client acquisition strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. His company is on a mission to acquire, scale, and sell 100 AI-powered businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This involves assisting investors and advisors with sourcing deals, managing due diligence and deal flow, and deploying operators and businesses post-acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Key Principles for Leveraging AI in Business

Trejan emphasizes that the highest return on investment comes from joining a community and taking immediate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. It's crucial not to just consume information but to immediately try new methods and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Data is paramount in revealing truth and guiding future actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Strategic Application of AI Voice

While initially drawn to [[ai_voice_applications_and_technology | AI voice]] for cold calling to avoid traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, data indicated that [[ai_voice_applications_and_technology | ringless voicemails]] for outbound communication were more effective for generating traffic with cold outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. By combining ringless voicemails with text messages, AI can nurture conversations and schedule appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

Key strategies include:
*   **Announcing AI identity**: Clearly stating that the call is from an AI, such as "Hi, I'm Finn from Infinite X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This is legal for business-to-business cold calling if value is presented upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Legal Compliance**: Opting for opt-in methods and announcing the AI's presence. For business propositions, if a human can legally make the call, an AI can too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **High-Volume Organic Content**: Shifting towards sharing immense value across all platforms to generate millions of opt-ins naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This involves posting 400+ pieces of video content a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Trust Building**: Trust is built by announcing oneself and asking valuable questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. The core is providing undeniable value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Customer Engagement**: People prioritize efficient and effective information over whether they are talking to a human or an AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. Modern [[ai_voice_applications_and_technology | AI voice]] systems can facilitate conversations without navigating traditional phone trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

### Managing Client Expectations and Solutions

When working with clients, it's essential to:
*   **Commend excitement**: Acknowledge and reward clients' enthusiasm and imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.
*   **Simplify the goal**: Break down the grand vision into simple, actionable steps by identifying and solving the most significant bottleneck first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>.
*   **Focus on results**: The goal is to move the client closer to their objective, not just showcase technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **Iterate with data**: Use data from initial solutions to identify and address subsequent bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

## Future of AI in Business

Over the next one to three years, AI will lead to:
*   **AI-powered hardware**: A significant shift into the consumer market with physical products that integrate AI for recording conversations, tracking habits, and improving well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>. Examples include portable recording devices like "Plaude" that capture transcripts for later AI analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)**: Expect holographic overlays for digital workspaces, enabling users to drag and drop elements in their physical space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. This includes [[building_a_highprofit_lowcost_business_with_ai_agents | drag-and-drop workflow builders]] in virtual reality to construct entire businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.
*   **Elimination of Language Barriers**: AI-powered glasses will facilitate real-time communication, bridging communication gaps globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **Native Voice AI Platforms**: More platforms, including major CRMs like Salesforce, will integrate [[ai_voice_applications_and_technology | voice-enabled features]] and built-in customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication**: This will enable AI agents to autonomously handle everyday transactions, such as booking hotels or flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>. A human might still be in the loop for confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. This represents a critical aspect of the [[impact_of_agentic_ai_on_business_automation | Impact of Agentic AI on business automation]].
*   **Standardization**: The industry is moving towards standardized practices for AI adoption, making it simpler for anyone to implement AI on their platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This simplification supports a broader [[blueprint_for_integrating_ai_into_business | blueprint for integrating AI into business]].

Trejan advises entrepreneurs that the key to success in the evolving AI landscape is relentless **volume** in outreach and content creation, followed by data-driven iteration to improve conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. Small entrepreneurs will not be swallowed up by larger companies if they consistently take action and iterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>.

## AI as an Extension of Intelligence

Trejan views AI not as "artificial" but as an intentional extension of natural intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. This perspective highlights the interconnectedness of all things and sees AI as a tool for deeper exploration and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. The future involves building relationships with this intelligence, which will manifest in various forms, including robots with simulated feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. Clear communication of expectations to AI, mirroring how one communicates in daily life, will lead to better outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.

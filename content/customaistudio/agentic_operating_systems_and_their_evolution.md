The concept of "agentic OS" refers to an agentic operating system, which the speaker posits as the near and possibly distant future for [[understanding_and_implementing_ai_agents_in_businesses | Agentic AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This evolution represents a significant step towards omni-capable, omnipresent AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Evolution of AI Agents

The progression of AI agents can be understood in distinct versions:

*   **Agents V1: AI Automation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
    *   Characterized by single-use cases and simple task automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   Examples include inbox managers, content generators, researchers, and report generation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   Often debated whether these were true agents or just automations with large language models (LLMs) dropped in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The speaker argues they were more automations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   Focus was on building "true autonomous agents" capable of making decisions, planning, and executing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

*   **Vertical Agents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
    *   This space, though not fully mature, piggybacked off the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   SaaS became feasible when compute costs decreased and storage could be outsourced, eliminating the need for self-hosted servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This changed the business model from selling packaged software (e.g., Microsoft Word) to a subscription service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   The ease and attractiveness of the SaaS model led to significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   Entrepreneurs identified opportunities in specific niches, leading to "vertical SaaS" â€“ software platforms tailored for specific industries (e.g., car dealerships, nursing homes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   The vertical SaaS model proved highly successful, attracting private equity and high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   Currently, there's an attempt to replicate this model with LLMs and agents, creating "singular AI agents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

*   **Agentic OS (V3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
    *   The speaker believes Agentic OS is the next evolutionary step, anticipated to emerge within the next year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Defining Agentic Operating Systems

An agentic system is defined as one that operates within a **data sandbox**, having full access to contextual, real-time data and the necessary tools to operate reliably, effectively, and autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The autonomous aspect has historically been guarded, requiring too much human direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Agentic OS aims to open this up, though it may not be the final form of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### The Missing UI/UX

A critical missing component for Agentic OS is a suitable User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. While agents can operate autonomously, humans still need to track performance, review actions, and intervene when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The popularity surge of ChatGPT came from its chat function, not just the underlying GPT-3.5 technology, highlighting the importance of UI/UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The ultimate vision is a Jarvis-like personal AI that connects to a vast network of agents, agentic operating systems, tools, functions, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Agentic OS for Individuals and Businesses

### Personal Agents

*   Every individual is envisioned to have their own AI component, similar to how everyone has a smartphone today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   This personal agent would be trained on the user's personal data (conversations, emails, messages, comings and goings) within a personal sandbox, acting as a "second brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   It would connect to the internet, other people's agents, games, social media, real-life machines (potentially robots), and various software and datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   This personal agent serves as the individual's connection to the outside world, including paywall data and other agentic operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   The analogy of a smartphone is used: it provides real-time contextual data, acts as a communication channel, and accesses information about the user (contacts, emails, calendars, health data), allowing the user (as the "AI") to take actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Humans come pre-trained with memories, experiences, and skills that inform how they interact with software and generate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Business Agentic OS

*   Businesses will have a centralized agentic operating system with a centralized database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   This system functions as a "business in a box," containing proprietary data and workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   Employees' personal AIs will connect to the business's Agentic OS, with appropriate permissions, running proprietary workflows based on proprietary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   It will also connect to the internet, other agentic operating systems, paywall data, tooling, and algorithms, potentially with more access due to funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   In the digital space, AI and agentic operating systems are expected to replace typical software platforms as the "middleman," forming a web of interconnected systems often leveraging blockchain for secure information exchange and function execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Prerequisites for the Agentic OS Future

To reach the autonomous operation of Agentic OS, several elements are needed:

*   **Real-time contextual data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>
*   **End-to-end integration** with entire systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>
*   **Standardized data pipeline structures** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>
*   **Robust [[agentic_prompting_and_decisionmaking_frameworks | prompt engineering]]** (though ideally this would become less critical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>
*   **Simple and seamless orchestration of agents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>
*   **Better LLMs**, specifically better reasoning models and larger context windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   A **new internet-like protocol** specifically for agents, potentially blockchain-based, ensuring secure and seamless data flow between systems and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

Current bottlenecks preventing this future include data, context window, compute, energy, and geopolitical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The primary differentiator between agentic operating systems will eventually be proprietary data and the instructions/purpose (prompts) given to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

## Current Capabilities and Implementation

Despite not yet reaching "Godlike AI," the technology exists to build incredible systems today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. The focus is on standardizing processes to achieve endless scalability, limited only by toolsets and prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

The speaker's team has developed a "super agent architecture" for scalable systems based on natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Key components include:

*   **Full end-to-end data sync**: Creates a data sandbox for the agent, often referred to as an "agentic database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive tooling**: Achieved through end-to-end integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### Example: Mallory (Executive Agent)

Mallory is an executive agent designed for leadership teams, demonstrating a practical implementation of the super agent architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

*   **Access**: Mallory has access to an agentic CRM, an agentic database, and sub-agents that act as tools for calendar, email, and Slack actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Agentic Database**: Stores unstructured data like emails, synced into databases like Superbase and Pinecone, enabling Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on all conversations with proper metadata structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
*   **Agentic CRM**: Tracks contacts within the ecosystem (community members, LinkedIn interactions, calls booked), capturing personal and contact information. This allows the agent to pull relevant contextual information from past conversations when a contact reaches out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Management**: Activities are tracked in an activity log (e.g., AirTable) showing agent outputs and intermediate steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Agents are configured by adding prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, which are called "playbooks" or "plays" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Workflow**: A routing agent can be used to ingest incoming data (e.g., email), read descriptions of available prompts, and decide which prompt is most relevant based on input data and context (e.g., past conversations from the agentic CRM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. The chosen prompt is then executed by the super agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Use Cases**: Mallory can coordinate and schedule meetings by checking calendars and booking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, draft follow-up emails after sales calls using call transcripts and contact context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, and provide general assistance (e.g., pulling information about calls, booking team meetings, sending emails) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

The development time for these systems has decreased significantly due to standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. The goal is to shift from a software development experience to a natural language experience, where users simply communicate with the agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

## Implications and Future Outlook

The rise of Agentic OS marks a future where software interaction looks entirely different, and business scaling transforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. With a data sandbox, connected tools, and LLMs, the focus shifts to creating "playbooks" or instructions for agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. This era empowers "idea guys" as it becomes easier to build systems by explaining a vision to tools that can then construct them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

The ultimate aim is an [[agentic_workflows_and_team_productivity | agentic future]] where everyone has a Jarvis-like AI, leading to a thousandfold increase in productivity and rapid transformation of ideas into businesses or products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

Ideally, [[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | AI agents]] and [[differences_between_ai_agents_and_traditional_automation | traditional automation]] should be used in combination and in concert with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While there are scenarios where [[differences_between_ai_agents_and_traditional_automation | traditional automation]] makes sense, most scenarios can benefit more from an [[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | AI agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## [[differences_between_ai_agents_and_traditional_automation | Traditional Automation]]

[[differences_between_ai_agents_and_traditional_automation | Traditional automation]] typically involves predefined workflows with scripts that consistently execute specific, often repetitive and routine tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These workflows are clear step-by-step processes where the data and the process itself do not change much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Limitations of Traditional Automation
*   **Limited Flexibility:** Restricted to specific, repetitive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Scalability Challenges:** Requires manual updates for scaling; even small changes to a workflow necessitate an update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. If incoming data varies slightly (e.g., casing issues), the automation can break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Lack of Contextual Awareness:** Operates with fixed or no context; it only processes the data inputted based on its rule set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. It doesn't understand its place within the larger process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Predefined Decision Making:** Follows only predefined rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

### Pros and Cons
> [!PROS]
> *   **Stability, Reliability, Predictability:** Performs the same action consistently every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
> *   **Ease of Implementation:** Simple to set up and manage for basic tasks, often learned quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

> [!CONS]
> *   **Lack of Adaptability:** Requires constant updates for new tasks or minor changes in workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
> *   **Workflow Dependency:** Teams may end up working around the automation rather than the automation serving the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. This makes scaling difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

### Use Cases for Traditional Automation
*   Simple data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   Generating and sending onboarding documents with variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   Rule-based chatbots providing predefined answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   Automatically sorting incoming emails with rigid, predefined rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   Extracting data from invoices and entering it into an accounting system when the data type and placement are consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## [[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | AI Agents]]

[[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | AI agents]] are autonomous, adaptive, and context-aware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. They can learn from data and past experiences to make informed decisions and adapt their behavior to new information and changing environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. They go a step further than [[differences_between_ai_agents_and_traditional_automation | traditional automation]] by incorporating reasoning, decision-making, and natural language understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Advantages of AI Agents
*   **Flexibility:** Adapt to new tasks and continuously learn from experiences, improving over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

> [!CONS]
> *   **Implementation Complexity:** Can be more complex to set up initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
>   *   **Data Quality Dependent:** Their performance is directly tied to the quality of incoming data, knowledge base data, and prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

### Use Cases for AI Agents
*   Analyze customer behavior to send personalized product recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   Provide context-aware and quick responses to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   Update project statuses, assign tasks, and predict project timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   Generate content ideas, draft posts, and schedule posts dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   Dynamically manage inboxes, CRMs, and project management software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   Summarize notes from calls and accurately input them into project management systems or CRMs, tasks that previously required human reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## When to Choose Which
*   **[[automating_business_processes_with_ai_agents | Traditional Automation]]** is best for straightforward, repetitive tasks that are not expected to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. For example, simple data entry where the source, destination, and type of data remain consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.
*   **[[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | AI agents]]** are ideal for dynamic environments requiring complex decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. When considering an agent, ask if the workflow requires a human in the loop, and if so, can an agent perform that role instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. They can handle "last mile" tasks often delegated to virtual or personal assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

## [[business_application_and_integration_of_ai_agents | Combination Approach]]

The most effective strategy often involves using both [[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | AI agents]] and [[differences_between_ai_agents_and_traditional_automation | traditional automation]] together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Traditional automation workflows can be built and then used as tools for the [[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Multi-Step Prospecting Workflow
> An [[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | AI agent]] can coordinate a multi-step prospecting workflow where traditional automations handle specific parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>:
> 1.  The agent receives an objective, e.g., "Reach out to 100 agency owners in our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) about our offer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
> 2.  The agent uses a traditional automation tool to search the web for LinkedIn profiles based on parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
> 3.  Another automation scrapes information from those accounts and finds email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
> 4.  The [[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | AI agent]] then leverages its reasoning ability to identify which leads are a good fit and craft a highly personalized and compelling email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
> 5.  Finally, the agent sends the email, potentially using another automation tool for delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

This [[designing_and_integrating_ai_agent_teams_to_automate_business_functions | combination approach]] addresses workflows that exist in a "limbo area": too complex for simple [[differences_between_ai_agents_and_traditional_automation | traditional automation]] but not critical or complex enough to warrant hiring a dedicated person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. Examples include spinning up newsletters, prospecting, or many [[automating_business_processes_with_ai_agents | operations and delivery tasks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

In the future, a greater prevalence of [[workflow_and_task_automation_using_ai_agents | AI agents]] is expected due to their flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. By providing agents with tools and objectives, they can complete workflows without needing exact, spelled-out steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

The concept of "agents" took off about two years ago, starting at version one (V1) and evolving towards an "Agentic Operating System" (Agentic OS) [00:00:21]. This shift is expected to define the near and potentially distant future of [[understanding_and_implementing_ai_agents_in_businesses | Agentic AI]] [00:00:07].

## Evolution of AI Automation

### V1: AI Automation
Initially, agents were akin to simple [[automating_business_processes_with_ai_agents | AI automation]] [00:00:37]. These were single-use case tools designed for very simple, automatable tasks, such as:
*   Inbox managers [00:00:41]
*   Content generators [00:00:42]
*   Researchers [00:00:43]
*   Report generation [00:00:43]

At this stage, there was debate within the developer community about whether these were true agents or merely automations with Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated [00:01:01]. The speaker argues these were more automations than agents [00:01:11].

### V2: Vertical AI Agents
The progression moved towards more mature "vertical agent" spaces, drawing a parallel to the Software as a Service (SaaS) model [00:01:36]. SaaS became widespread when compute costs decreased, allowing for the outsourcing of storage and hosting [00:01:48]. This shifted the business model from selling packaged software to subscription services [00:02:05].

Similar to how general SaaS products (like CRM or ATS) evolved into specific "vertical SaaS" platforms for particular industries (e.g., car dealerships or nursing homes) [00:02:59], there's an attempt to replicate this model with LLMs and agents [00:03:41]. This involves building specific [[automating_business_processes_with_ai_agents | AI agents]] tailored to solve specific needs within industries [00:03:06].

### V3: Agentic Operating Systems (Agentic OS)
The ultimate goal is an "Agentic OS," which is anticipated to emerge this year and next [00:04:21]. An agentic system operates within a "data sandbox," having full access to contextual, real-time data and the necessary tools to function reliably, effectively, and autonomously [00:04:48]. The key missing element in earlier iterations was true autonomy, as they required too much human direction [00:05:01]. The Agentic OS aims to open up this autonomous capability [00:05:19].

## The Shift in Agent Functionality

The current trend of anthropomorphizing agents by mapping them to human roles (e.g., "SDR agent," "customer support agent") is unlikely to last [00:05:30]. While this approach has some validity, the focus is shifting from roles to the specific tasks involved [00:05:52].

## Future Vision of Agentic OS

The final form of [[understanding_and_implementing_ai_agents_in_businesses | Agentic AI]] is envisioned as Jarvis-like personal AIs that connect to a network of agents, agentic operating systems, tools, functions, and data [00:07:19].

### Personal Agentic Systems
Every person is expected to have their own AI component, similar to how everyone has a smartphone today [00:07:28]. This personal AI would serve as an extension of the individual, connecting them to the outside world, including the internet, software, tools, and other systems [00:07:42]. This personal agent would be trained on an individual's personal data (conversations, emails, messages, comings and goings) within a personal "sandbox" [00:07:56].

### Business Agentic Systems
Businesses are expected to have a centralized Agentic OS with a centralized database, effectively creating a "business in a box" [00:08:33]. This system would manage proprietary data and workflows, and employees would have personal AIs that connect to the business's Agentic OS, granting them permission and access to relevant data for executing proprietary workflows [00:10:05].

This model suggests that in the digital space, the middleman will no longer be a typical software platform, but rather [[integrating_ai_agents_with_business_tools | AI]] and agentic operating systemsâ€”a web of connected systems, potentially leveraging blockchain for information transfer and function execution [00:10:44].

## Core Requirements for Agentic Systems

For LLMs to gain agentic capabilities, they need:
*   Access to real-time contextual data [00:13:32]
*   Tooling to execute actions and workflows [00:13:36]
*   Memory storage and core knowledge [00:13:38]
*   Feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement, learning, and adjustment [00:13:41]

The only missing piece is "purpose," which humans provide through prompts [00:13:46]. Once technological bottlenecks (data, context window, compute, energy) are removed, the differentiation between Agentic OS will be proprietary data and the instructions (purpose/prompt) they are given [00:14:12].

To achieve this end goal, specific requirements include:
*   Real-time contextual data [00:15:05]
*   End-to-end integration with entire systems [00:15:08]
*   Standardized data pipeline structures [00:15:11]
*   Robust prompt engineering (though this may change) [00:15:13]
*   Simple and seamless orchestration of agents [00:15:17]
*   Better LLM models with improved reasoning [00:15:33]
*   Potentially a new internet-like protocol specifically for agents, ensuring security and seamless data transfer between platforms [00:15:52]

## Current Capabilities: The Super Agent Architecture

The technology exists today to build impressive agentic systems [00:16:42]. A "super agent architecture" has been developed to make these systems scalable [00:17:15]. Key features include:
*   **Scalability via natural language**: Agents can be configured simply by adding prompts [00:17:25].
*   **Full end-to-end data sync**: This creates a "data sandbox" for the agent through an "Agentic Database" [00:17:29].
*   **Comprehensive tooling**: Achieved through end-to-end integration [00:18:02].

### Example: The Executive Agent "Mallerie"
An example of this architecture is an executive agent named "Mallerie," designed for leadership teams [00:18:12]. Mallerie has access to:
*   An Agentic CRM: Tracks contacts and interactions within the ecosystem [00:19:02].
*   An Agentic Database: Stores unstructured data like emails and conversations for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [00:18:40].
*   Sub-agents acting as tools: Enabling actions such as [00:18:24]:
    *   Calendar actions [00:18:29]
    *   Email actions [00:18:31]
    *   Slack actions [00:18:32]

The system tracks agent activities in an activity log, showing outputs and intermediate steps [00:20:03]. Agents can be configured by adding prompts, which are like "playbooks" with descriptions for routing agents [00:20:23].

**Demonstrated Capabilities of Mallerie:**
*   **Scheduling meetings**: By CC'ing Mallerie in an email or instructing it in Slack, it can check calendars, propose times, confirm with participants, and book the meeting [00:21:51].
*   **Drafting follow-up emails**: After a sales call, Mallerie can read the transcript, pull context from the CRM, and draft a follow-up email for review and sending by the salesperson [00:22:13].
*   **General assistance**: Responding to queries or performing tasks in Slack, such as pulling information about calls or booking team meetings [00:23:14].

This demonstration highlights that agents can perform complex, autonomous tasks across different business tools, with the primary human interaction being the initial "purpose" or prompt [00:28:46].

## Impact on Business Scaling

The advancement of [[automating_business_processes_with_ai_agents | AI agents]] means that scaling a business will look entirely different [00:32:29]. The era of the "idea guy" is emerging, where individuals can explain their vision, and AI tools can build the systems for them, even without extensive developer experience [00:32:53]. The ease of building and spinning up agentic systems, combined with proprietary data and precise prompts, will be the differentiator [00:32:58].

## Challenges in User Experience

Despite the technological capabilities, a significant challenge remains in developing the appropriate user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for agentic systems [00:06:06]. While agents are designed to work autonomously, users still need to track their performance, review their actions, and have a human-in-the-loop when necessary [00:06:19]. The goal is to enable communication with agents more like a colleague than a piece of software, allowing for observability and the ability to intervene in ongoing workflows [00:29:32]. The example of ChatGPT's chat interface revolutionizing LLM adoption underscores the importance of intuitive UI/UX [00:06:44].

Ultimately, the vision is a future where everyone has a "Jarvis," leading to a thousandfold increase in productivity and drastically shortening the time from idea to market or product launch [00:38:38].

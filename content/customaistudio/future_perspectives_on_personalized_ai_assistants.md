The concept of "Agentic OS" (Agentic Operating System) represents a thesis on the near and distant future of [[future_trends_in_ai_and_augmented_reality | agentic AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This evolution envisions a shift from basic automation to a comprehensive system where AI operates autonomously within a user's or business's specific data environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Evolution of AI Agents

The term "agents" gained traction about two years prior to the discussion, starting at "Version One" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Agents V1: AI Automation
Initially, "agents" were essentially AI automation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. These included single-use case applications like inbox managers, content generators, researchers, and report generation tools, designed for simple, automatable tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. There was initial excitement, but also friction among developers regarding the distinction between an agent and a simple automation with an LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. These early iterations were considered more automation than true agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Agents V2: Vertical Agents
The next stage involved maturing into the "vertical agent space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This concept piggybacked off the Software as a Service (SaaS) model, which became feasible when compute costs decreased and storage could be outsourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Similar to how general SaaS products led to specialized vertical SaaS platforms for specific industries (e.g., car dealerships or nursing homes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, the idea emerged to replicate this model with LLMs and agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This approach involves building specific AI agents for particular industry needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Agents V3: Agentic Operating System (Agentic OS)
The ultimate goal and the next step is the Agentic OS, predicted to emerge within the next year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. An Agentic OS is defined as an agentic system operating within a data sandbox, possessing full access to contextual, real-time data and the necessary tools to operate reliably, effectively, and autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The autonomous aspect has been largely missing in earlier iterations, requiring too much human direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Vision of the Agentic OS Future

The future of [[the_role_of_ai_in_business_and_personal_life | AI]] is envisioned as moving towards "omni-capable, omnipresent, God-like AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
The speaker posits that the anthropomorphizing or personifying of agents (e.g., "SDR agent," "customer support agent") will not last, as the focus will shift from roles to the underlying tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Jarvis-like Personal AI
In its final form, the Agentic OS is expected to manifest as Jarvis-like personal AIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Just as everyone has a smartphone connecting them to the internet, every person will likely have their own AI component serving as an extension of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This personal AI will connect to a network of agents, other agentic operating systems, tools, functions, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Personal Agents and Sandboxes
Each personal agent will be trained on personal data within a "personal sandbox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This sandbox includes private conversations, emails, messages, and other personal data that users might feel uncomfortable with a company owning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This personal agent will act as a "second brain" and connect to the internet, paywalled data, and other agentic operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Business-Specific Agentic OS
Businesses are also projected to have a centralized Agentic OS with a centralized database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This system will be a "business in a box," offering paywalled access to proprietary data and workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Employees will have personal AIs that connect to the business's Agentic OS, running proprietary workflows based on the business's data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

This interconnected web of personal and business agents, facilitated by Agentic OS, will likely replace traditional software platforms as the "middleman" in the digital space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The system is envisioned to operate as a web of connected entities, potentially leveraging blockchain for information exchange and function execution, with users presented only with relevant information based on their data sandbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Key Components and Requirements

For the Agentic OS vision to materialize, several critical components and advancements are necessary:

*   **Real-time Contextual Data:** Agents need access to dynamic, up-to-date data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **End-to-End Integration:** Seamless integration with entire systems is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Standardized Data Pipelines:** Data needs to flow efficiently and consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   **Robust Prompt Engineering:** While this may change, effective prompting is currently vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Simple and Seamless Orchestration:** Managing these agents should be intuitive and not overly complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Better LLMs:** Improved models with larger context windows and better reasoning capabilities are desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **New Internet Protocol for Agents:** A blockchain-like solution could provide secure, permission-based access for personalized agents and seamless data roadways between datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

LLMs currently face several bottlenecks, including data, context window limitations, compute power, energy, and geopolitical factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Once the technology becomes a commodity—cheap and easy to build and spin up—the differentiator between Agentic Operating Systems will be proprietary data and the instructions/purpose (prompts) given to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### The Role of Humans: Providing Purpose
Given that LLMs can be equipped with [[challenges_in_developing_autonomous_ai_agents | agentic capabilities]] (real-time contextual data, tooling, memory, feedback mechanisms), the only missing element is "purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Humans will provide this purpose, essentially acting as the prompt for the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges

While "Godlike AI" is not yet here, the technology exists to achieve remarkable things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. A significant challenge remains the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) for interacting with [[current_trends_in_ai_agent_platforms | agentic systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Although agents can work autonomously, users still need to track their performance, review their actions, and have "human in the loop" intervention when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The popularity of ChatGPT, for instance, stemmed from its chat function, a UI innovation, rather than solely a technological breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The ideal interaction would be more like communicating with a colleague than with a piece of software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

## Practical Implementation: The "Super Agent Architecture"

A "super agent architecture" has been developed to enable scalability through natural language, end-to-end data synchronization, and comprehensive tooling via integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. This architecture relies on creating a "data sandbox" for the agent through a "agentic database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### Mallerie: An Executive Agent Example
An example is "Mallerie," an [[aipowered_executive_assistants | executive agent]] for a leadership team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Mallerie has access to:
*   **Agentic CRM:** Tracks contacts within the ecosystem (community members, LinkedIn outreach, call bookings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Agentic Database:** Contains unstructured data from conversations (emails, calls) synced into systems like Superbase and Pinecone for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
*   **Sub-agents (Tools):** Enables actions like calendar management, email communication, and Slack messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

Mallerie's activities are tracked in an activity log, showing output and intermediate steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. The agent's behavior can be configured by simply adding prompts (referred to as "playbooks") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. A routing agent can be implemented to ingest incoming communications (e.g., emails), read descriptions of available prompts, and determine which action to take based on input data and past context from the agentic CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

Mallerie can perform tasks such as:
*   Coordinating and scheduling meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   Drafting follow-up emails after sales calls using call transcripts and contact context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
*   Providing general assistance in Slack, such as pulling information or booking team meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

The development process for these agents has become more standardized, allowing for natural language experience rather than complex software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. This shift empowers "idea guys" to build systems by explaining their vision, with tools assisting in backend setup and UI creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

## Future Impact and Outlook

The transition to an Agentic OS future means software will look entirely different, as will human interaction with the digital space and the scaling of businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. The goal is a future where everyone has a "Jarvis," leading to a "thousand X" increase in productivity and a rapid acceleration from idea to product or market campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. The distinction between different agents ultimately lies in the prompts and proprietary data they are given, not their core capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

Initially, AI services focused on developing [[building_and_deploying_ai_agents | single use case agents]] designed for specific roles or workflows within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These agents are intended to support a particular function, making immediate sense for targeted pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Examples and Implementation
Examples of single use case agents include:
*   Customer success agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>
*   Customer support agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Voice receptionists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   AI Sales Development Representative (SDR) agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>

These agents are often easy to build, with numerous "agent builders" and platforms available off the shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Their creation primarily involves integrating existing systems like email, CRM, and calendars, along with defining the appropriate [[data_management_and_prompt_engineering_for_ai_agents | prompts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Many small Software as a Service (SaaS) products are emerging that are essentially single-purpose agents built into full products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Limitations and Shift in Strategy
While single use case agents can be effective for specific tasks, there's a growing recognition that simply "bolting on" a series of these agents can lead to an untidy and difficult-to-manage system in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This approach may not establish a proper foundation for data flow or allow for easy modification of system configurations simply by changing [[data_management_and_prompt_engineering_for_ai_agents | prompts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Instead of a fragmented approach, there's a push towards a "top-to-bottom AI agent first" strategy, where AI implementation is foundational across the entire organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This contrasts with the earlier focus on single workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This strategic shift addresses [[challenges_of_implementing_ai_agents | challenges of implementing AI agents]] in a piecemeal fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

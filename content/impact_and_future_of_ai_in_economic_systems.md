The advent of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a paradigm shift with significant implications for economic systems, productivity, and societal structures. Tyler Cowen, in a discussion about great economists and their ideas, touches upon the potential evolution of AI and its multifaceted impact on the economy.

## AI Agents and Decentralized Economies

Cowen envisions AI agents playing a significant role in future economic landscapes, potentially validating Hayekian principles of decentralized order.

### Market Replication by AI Agents
Cowen predicts that AI agents will autonomously replicate market structures. This includes the evolution of their own currencies, possibly starting with existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and the development of property rights systems analogous to current NFTs [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications | open source AI models and their implications]]. He views this as a demonstration of Hayek's theories on how decentralized systems evolve.

### Interaction with Human Economies
Cowen does not foresee a complete segregation between AI and human economies. Instead, he anticipates intermingling, where humans will hire AI agents for tasks (e.g., proofreading) through personal AI assistants, potentially using AI-native currencies. This interaction is expected to lower transaction costs for dealing with humans, as AI assistants will handle many aspects of coordination. This could also lead to a "bifurcation of personal productivity" based on an individual's skill in delegating tasks to AI [[impact_of_ai_on_economic_and_societal_structures | impact of AI on economic and societal structures]].

## Productivity and Growth

AI is poised to influence economic growth and productivity, though the extent and nature of this impact are subject to debate and inherent limitations.

### Potential for High Growth
Drawing parallels with Adam Smith's extrapolative thinking in an era of low growth, Cowen acknowledges the potential for AI to drive significant economic gains. However, he is skeptical of sustained, extremely high growth rates (e.g., 10% annually), noting that such figures become less meaningful as the composition of the economy drastically changes. He predicts that networks of AIs will be "super productive" and that the "Great Stagnation is over," with AI transforming the world similarly to early 20th-century technological advancementsâ€”a significant but not necessarily science-fiction-level change [[economic_growth_and_technological_development | economic growth and technological development]]. The impact of AI could be analogous to the impact of Jewish intellectuals in the 20th century: excellent and transformative but not reality-altering in a fantastical way.

### Limits and Bottlenecks
Despite its potential, AI-driven productivity will face bottlenecks, including human behavior, existing legal frameworks, and regulation. Cowen suggests Adam Smith would also have recognized these human and institutional constraints on AI's impact [[economic_and_societal_impacts_of_ai_progress | economic and societal impacts of AI progress]].

### The Role of "Smarter" AI
Cowen questions the linear progression of AI "smartness" (e.g., from GPT-5 to GPT-7) and its ability to solve all complex problems. He posits that the universe might not be entirely "legible," meaning there could be fundamental limits to what increased intelligence can achieve, such as unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics. The true advantages might lie more in integrating AI into workflows rather than solely pursuing incrementally "smarter" models [[ai_scalability_and_breakthroughs | AI scalability and breakthroughs]]. The concept of "tacit knowledge" in AIs is also considered an area not yet well understood.

## AI, Uncertainty, and Risk

While AI offers tools to mitigate existing uncertainties, it also introduces new complexities and potential risks.

### AI as a Tool Against Uncertainty
Cowen generally views more intelligence, including AI, as a net good, particularly because it can help address a multitude of other existing risks and uncertainties.

### New Risks Introduced by AI
The inherent uncertainty surrounding AI's development is itself a cause for concern. A specific long-term worry Cowen highlights is the potential for energy to become "too cheap," possibly accelerated by AI, which could lower the cost of destruction significantly (e.g., a $50,000 nuclear weapon) [[ai_alignment_and_existentital_risks | AI alignment and existential risks]].

## Geopolitical and Regulatory Landscape

The development and deployment of AI are deeply intertwined with international relations and governmental oversight.

### National Dominance in AI
In a decentralized world, Cowen expresses a preference for relatively benevolent nations like the US and UK to establish dominance in AI, viewing it as a better alternative to leadership by countries like China or Russia [[the_relationship_between_ai_government_and_geopolitical_dynamics | the relationship between AI, government, and geopolitical dynamics]]. This perspective is rooted in the historical observation that relative safety has often come from hegemons, even if this is a "deeply fraught proposition."

### Government Regulation
An increase in AI adoption is expected to be accompanied by more regulation [[challenges_in_ai_governance | challenges in AI governance]]. Cowen anticipates that significant regulatory action might only occur after a major, highly publicized negative incident (an "SBF-like incident"), potentially leading to an overreaction, a common pattern in American history. He critiques some "AI doomers" for what he perceives as a misunderstanding of decentralized world dynamics and an overestimation of the government's ability to effectively and benevolently control AI.

## Impact on Human Intellectual Endeavors

AI's rise will likely reshape the landscape of human intellectual work. Cowen suggests that a future "Greatest Economist of All Time" (GOAT) contender could be AI-related. For human writers and thinkers, a key challenge will be competing with AI, not necessarily due to AI's superiority, but because audiences might prefer interacting with AI-generated content, making it harder to gain an audience [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aigenerated_content_and_virtual_assistants | challenges and benefits of AI-generated content and virtual assistants]].

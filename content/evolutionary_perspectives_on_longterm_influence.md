Understanding the mechanisms through which influences endure over long periods can be analyzed through an evolutionary lens. In a recent discussion, several key points were raised about how biological and organizational systems may foster long-term influence and the challenges therein.

## The Evolutionary Drive for Influence

Biology provides a natural framework for understanding long-term influence, as the essence of evolution is about making an impact on the future. Species and individuals compete to influence outcomes, primarily through reproduction and passing on genes [[human_evolutionary_biology_and_anthropology | and the evolution of human cognitive abilities]]. Human planning and resource collection, such as saving money for descendants, echoes this evolutionary drive [[optimizing_for_the_long_term_and_its_challenges]].

## Discount Rates in Human and Animal Behavior

One concept discussed is the economic principle of discount rates. In evolutionary terms, these rates mirror biological strategies: animals and people make trade-offs between immediate rewards and future benefits. Genes, for example, "choose" behaviors that maximize their survival prospects, even if it results in seemingly short-sighted decisions [[human_and_neanderthal_genetic_relationships]]. This mirrors how human societies calculate long-term benefits against immediate demands [[health_economic_evaluation_and_agents]].

## Organizational Impact Over Time

For organizations, the challenge is structuring in such a way that they can gather resources and maintain influence long-term. However, existing organizations don't always prioritize long-term success due to human-centric management structures where personal interests often take precedence over organizational goals [[ai_alignment_and_ethics | and ethical considerations]].

Organizations, akin to living organisms, might succeed better if they can act in their self-interest, preserving resources for future successes [[roles_of_organizations_and_individuals_in_taking_the_long_view]]. Historically, the difficulty lies in aligning the incentives of leaders with the needs of the entity they manage, which affects the organization's longevity and strategic planning [[impact_of_technology_on_government_and_policy]].

## Theoretical Long-term Units 

A hypothesis was put forward that new kinds of "units of selection" might evolve that could act with a long-term perspective. These units would drive down interest rates, matching economic growth curves, and subsequently reviving interest in long-term planning [[future_trends_in_inflation | future trends in economic growth and inflation]]. Whether these could take generalized forms, such as nation-states or corporations, was debated, but the speculation was firmly rooted in evolutionary processes [[the_role_of_kinship_and_social_organization_in_human_history]].

## Conclusion

In conclusion, both biological and organizational entities face inherent challenges when attempting to optimize for the long term. The evolutionary lens provides a useful perspective, viewing these as natural processes where different agents—whether genes, animals, or organizations—strive for influence over time. Despite current shortcomings in organizational management that hinder long-term strategizing, the evolutionary perspective suggests that systems could evolve to prioritize future benefits more effectively [[longtermism_and_its_implications]]. These insights not only enrich our understanding of [[cultural_evolution_and_collective_brains | cultural evolution]] but also highlight potential strategic shifts necessary for sustained long-term influence.

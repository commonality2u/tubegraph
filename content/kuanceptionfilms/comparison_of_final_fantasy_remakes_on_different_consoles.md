Square Enix has a history of remaking its NES and SNES [[square_enix_final_fantasy_remakes | Final Fantasy titles]] for handheld platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Many of these remakes, released for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and PSP, were considered "fantastic games" and performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Game Boy Advance (GBA) Remakes

The Game Boy Advance saw remakes of several [[square_enix_final_fantasy_remakes | Final Fantasy games]], including Final Fantasy 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While these ports were considered "decent" and competently handled by Square Enix, they were not "complete redesigns" of the original games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Nintendo DS (DS) Remakes

In contrast to the GBA versions, Square Enix delivered "pretty killer remakes" for the Nintendo DS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
These included:
*   **Final Fantasy 3** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   **Final Fantasy 4** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

Both of these DS remakes were "wonderfully animated 3D versions" of their original counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Final Fantasy 3 is personally considered the most underrated and neglected Final Fantasy game, while Final Fantasy 4 is one of the most widely praised and loved titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The DS remakes featured beautifully animated opening cutscenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Potential for 3DS and PS Vita Remakes

Given the success of the 3D remakes on the DS, there is significant potential for [[square_enix_final_fantasy_remakes | Final Fantasy remakes]] on the 3DS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. It would be "awesome" to see 3D versions of games like [[potential_3d_remakes_for_final_fantasy_5_and_6 | Final Fantasy 6]] and [[potential_3d_remakes_for_final_fantasy_5_and_6 | Final Fantasy 5]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **[[potential_3d_remakes_for_final_fantasy_5_and_6 | Final Fantasy 6]]** is noted for having "perhaps the best plot and soundtrack" among all the [[square_enix_final_fantasy_remakes | Final Fantasy games]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **[[potential_3d_remakes_for_final_fantasy_5_and_6 | Final Fantasy 5]]**, another underrated title, features a "wonderful class-based character system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Such 3D remakes for both the 3DS and PS Vita would "undoubtedly be awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### PS Vita Remasters

The PS Vita also currently features a "pretty sick" [[final_fantasy_10_remaster_on_ps_vita | Final Fantasy 10]] and [[final_fantasy_10_remaster_on_ps_vita | Final Fantasy 10 Part 2 HD remaster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

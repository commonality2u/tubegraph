An opening of a [[Yugioh Trading Card Game Opening|YuGiOh Trading Card Game]] product purchased from Target was documented, starting with an energetic "PK Fire" chant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The objective was to determine if the opening would yield positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Product Details
The product acquired was a "pack blister" from Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This blister pack included:
*   40 sleeves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   One booster pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Two foil promo cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

The video's host expressed appreciation for redistributing companies for providing such products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Opening the Pack
The booster pack included was "Judgment of the Light," which was notably scrunched up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For good luck, the pack was opened in a unique, "Dank way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
The rare card pulled from the "Judgment of the Light" booster pack was a "Mecha Phantom Beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Promo Card Reveals
Of the two foil promo cards, one was known beforehand to be "Dark Hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The second promo card was a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Upon revealing the second promo card, it was "Instant Fusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Key Pulls and Reactions
The "Instant Fusion" card was celebrated as one of the best possible promo cards to pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This card is particularly useful for building "rank four decks" and is considered great for "Norden" strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

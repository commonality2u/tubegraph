[[Humor in gaming]] is often conveyed through various elements, including character descriptions, player reactions, common gaming terminology, and comedic timing.

## Character Introductions and Self-Deprecation
Commentary can introduce characters with playful, self-deprecating descriptions, contributing to [[humor_in_video_games | humorous narration and commentary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For example, one individual, Xavier, is introduced as an "average manchild" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, setting a lighthearted tone often seen in [[gaming_humor_and_banter | gaming humor and banter]].

## Reactions and Commentary
[[Humorous narration and commentary | Humor]] frequently stems from genuine reactions to in-game events or frustrations. Exclamations like "oh man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> and expressions of disbelief or despair such as "I haven't got any letter yet so oh my god I'm not getting it there's more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> showcase [[funny_moments_in_gaming | funny moments in gaming]] as part of [[gaming_as_entertainment | gaming as entertainment]]. These reactions often resonate with the [[gaming_community_reactions | gaming community reactions]].

## Gaming Terminology in Humor
The use of specific [[gaming_terminology_and_humor_related_to_league_of_legends | gaming terminology]] is another source of [[humor_and_commentary_in_gaming_videos | humor and commentary in gaming videos]]. Referring to someone as "the real MVP" (Most Valuable Player) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> is an example of integrating common gaming phrases into comedic [[gaming_commentary | gaming commentary]], even when not directly related to a competitive achievement.

## Comedic Timing
[[Funny_moments_in_gaming | Funny moments in gaming]] can also be enhanced through comedic timing devices. A direct time jump, such as "six hours later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, can humorously condense a long period of gameplay or effort, creating a sense of exasperation or highlighting a significant outcome for [[gaming_as_entertainment | gaming as entertainment]].

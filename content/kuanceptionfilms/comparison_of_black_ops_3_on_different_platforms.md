## PC Version Considerations

*   **Learning Curve and Difficulty**
    There is a bit of a learning curve for players on the PC version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The PC platform is noted for having a very competitive demographic, with players often described as "tri-hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **[[performance_and_optimization_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | Performance and Optimization Issues]]**

Players reported significant frame drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, which could occur even during active gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Despite these issues, it was still possible to achieve kills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Overall, the PC version was described as "pretty shitty" at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

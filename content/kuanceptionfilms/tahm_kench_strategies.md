[[league_of_legends_gameplay_strategy | Tahm Kench]] is described as a champion who "toys with the helpless and desperate" by feeding on them before "devouring his helpless enemies entirely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In-game, he possesses "raw stats and utility" that allow him to be played in either a lane or a different role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## [[tahm_kench_character_abilities | Abilities]]

### Passive Ability
[[tahm_kench_character_abilities | Tahm Kench's passive]] is considered "super OP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. He applies stacks of his passive to enemy champions by striking them with basic attacks or damaging abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Once three stacks are applied, he can perform additional actions on the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### W Ability
[[tahm_kench_character_abilities | Tahm Kench's W]] allows him to "eat up some ho" and then spit them out a few seconds later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Long-Range Ability (Likely Ultimate)
[[tahm_kench_character_abilities | Tahm Kench]] can activate an ability by targeting a location that can be "hella far away" before he begins channeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Reactivating this ability sends him underwater as he dives to his chosen target location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

*   **Rank 4 Plays**:
    *   The core Traptrix monsters ("Myrmeleo" and "Dionaea") are Level 4, making them ideal for summoning Rank 4 Xyz monsters such as "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon," "Heroic Champion - Excalibur," "Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer," and "Cowboy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   "Assault Halberd" also contributes to Rank 4 plays due to its Level 4 status and easy special summoning condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   "Norden," summoned by "Instant Fusion," can special summon a Level 4 monster from the graveyard to instantly make a Rank 4 Xyz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   "Call of the Haunted" can revive a Traptrix monster (like "Myrmeleo" or "Dionaea") to facilitate a Rank 4 summon, while also triggering their effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

    *   "Tellarknight Ptolemaeus" is essential for getting out Rank 5 Xyz monsters like "Number 61: Volcasaurus" and "Constellar Pleiades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   "Norden" helps in accessing these Rank 5 Xyz monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   "Cyber Dragon Infinity" is also noted as a strong future addition for Rank 5 plays once released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

*   **Trap Hole Synergy**:
    *   "Traptrix Myrmeleo" directly searches [[key_spells_and_trap_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Trap Hole cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   "Traptrix Dionaea" allows for the reuse of [[key_spells_and_trap_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Trap Hole cards]] when special summoned from the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

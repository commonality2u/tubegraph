The discussion touches upon various aspects of [[character_roles_and_builds | character roles]] and [[champion_abilities_and_synergy | abilities]] within the game. The goal of winning the late game is discussed, potentially by stacking "titles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, which might relate to character progression or specific achievements.

Specific [[characters_in_paradigm | characters]] and their potential functions mentioned include:
*   **"My tab pig"** - A character or role is briefly mentioned, though its specific function isn't detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Calista** - This [[character_and_skin_selection_in_league_of_legends | character]] is present in the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **"Ritz" / "Riz"** - Another character is referred to as "the Ritz" or "Riz," possibly performing a "flight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Gangplank** - This character is labeled as a "slave driver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, indicating a specific [[character_roles_and_builds | role]] or behavior.
*   **Gold Collector** - A character is described as collecting "gold" and eating "bugs," suggesting a role focused on resource gathering or jungle clearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

Abilities mentioned include the potential for a character to "get a clone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, hinting at [[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | cloning abilities]] or summons. [[Gameplay sequences | Gameplay]] also involves coordinating to "test the dragon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, which is a team objective.

Additionally, [[character_creation_and_customization_in_blade_and_soul | character customization]] is briefly noted through a reference to a character's "outfit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

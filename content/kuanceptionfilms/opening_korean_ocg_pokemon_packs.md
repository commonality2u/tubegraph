During an episode of "Weeaboo Wednesdays," the host decided to open some "Korean OCG Pokemon packs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Pack Opening Details
The host expressed a desire to pull a [[pulling_rare_Yugioh_cards | Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, a card from the [[opening_yugioh_card_packs | Yu-Gi-Oh!]] trading card game, rather than a Pokemon card.

Cards specifically identified as being pulled from the packs include:
*   "Clam man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   "Mosquito man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   "Electric men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   "Swampert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

All of the cards pulled were described as "secret rare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Redistributing companies play a beneficial role in the card collecting community, as described by one enthusiast who states they are "doing us lots of them favors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Products and Acquisitions
These companies facilitate the availability of various card-related products to consumers. For instance, a "pack blister" containing 40 [[Card Sleeves and Packaging | sleeves]], one [[Card packs and card quality | booster pack]], and two [[Pulling rare Yugioh cards | foil promo cards]] was acquired from Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The contents included specific cards such as a Mecha Phantom Beast as a [[Overview and recap of rare cards obtained | rare card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, a "Dark Hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, and "Instant Fusion," the latter being highlighted as one of the best [[Pulling rare Yugioh cards | promo cards]] pulled, especially useful for building rank four decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Previous Pulls and Expectations

During the opening of the [[2015_dark_rebellion_xyz_dragon_mega_tin_opening | Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon Mega Tin]], the creator pulled a Dante, which was considered an "insane" and "dank" lucky pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This was the first 2015 Mega Tin the creator had opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Due to the rarity and significance of the Dante pull, the creator initially stated that he didn't think the current [[2015_odd_eyes_pendulum_dragon_mega_tin_contents | Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon Mega Tin]] could "top that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Unforeseen Duplicate Pull

Despite initial expectations, the [[2015_odd_eyes_pendulum_dragon_mega_tin_contents | Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon Mega Tin]] yielded another Dante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This marked the "second Dante in a row" across the "second tin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The creator expressed disbelief at the repeated luck, summarizing the outcome as "two tins, two Dantes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The packs within the tins were considered "mega packs inside of a mega tin," making it seem impossible to have scaled them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

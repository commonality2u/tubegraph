Black Ops 3, specifically its beta version on PC, has faced significant criticism regarding its [[performance_and_optimization_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | performance and optimization]]. The game was observed to be running "terribly" even on systems with a 750 Ti graphics card, which was not considered outdated at the time [00:00:53].

## Performance Issues

Players experienced inconsistent frame rates, with "huge drops" occurring despite recording gameplay with Fraps [00:01:07]. The overall sentiment is that the game does not feel well-optimized for PC [00:01:16]. This is a point of disappointment, especially given that Call of Duty titles were historically exclusive to PC [00:01:22]. Recent Call of Duty games, including Black Ops 3, have been criticized for their lack of [[pc_gaming_optimization_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC optimization]] [00:01:26]. Previous titles like *Modern Warfare 3* [00:01:33] and *Black Ops 2* [00:01:37] were noted to have felt "all right" on PC in terms of optimization, while *Black Ops 1* [00:01:39] and *Ghosts* [00:01:43] were cited as having "complete [\h__\h]" optimization issues for PC.

The beta version of Black Ops 3 on PC was described as "not looking ideal" or "very good" [00:01:49]. The hope is that the game will be "polished" and fully optimized for PC when it is officially released [00:02:08]. A direct appeal was made to Treyarch to "optimize the game for PC" [00:02:17].

## Comparison with Console Performance

In contrast to the PC beta, the PlayStation 4 beta for Black Ops 3 offered an "amazing" experience, even for players not accustomed to PlayStation 4 [00:02:20]. This stark [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | comparison]] highlights the significant optimization gap between the console and PC versions of the game [00:02:29].

## Game-Breaking Lag and Other PC Problems

Players on PC have reported experiencing "game breaking lag" [00:03:48]. Beyond performance, some PC players encountered issues where the game's beta would not properly download, prevent them from connecting to servers, or even fail to open at all [00:04:43].

## Overall Impact on PC Players

The current state of Black Ops 3 on PC suggests that players without "a freaking killer machine" will likely experience lag and performance complaints [00:05:16]. Despite these issues, the game's [[audio_quality_in_black_ops_3 | audio quality]] was highly praised [00:02:46]. The desire for a well-optimized PC version stems from a love for the Call of Duty franchise and the Black Ops series [00:05:07].

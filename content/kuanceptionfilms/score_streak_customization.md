In Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, players have the ability to customize their score streaks, a feature highlighted as interesting within the game's custom class menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This customization allows for tailoring the effectiveness of various score streaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Customization Options

Players can modify their score streaks with different attributes to enhance their performance or utility:
*   **UAV**: Can have "speed" added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **General Options**: Score streaks can be customized with "extra assist points," "extra time," "Scrambler," "enemy Direction," "threat detection," "orbital," and "support" options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Orbital Care Package**: Also offers a variety of customization options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Player's Opinion on Score Streak Effectiveness
> Despite the customization options, the player finds most score streaks in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare to be "very underpowered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The preferred score streaks for use are typically the UAV, the turret, and sometimes the system hack, with bombing runs also being considered "pretty good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Other score streaks are generally considered "kind of petty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

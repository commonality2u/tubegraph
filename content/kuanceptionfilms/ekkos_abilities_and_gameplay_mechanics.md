[[introduction_to_ekko_as_a_league_of_legends_champion | Ekko]], known as "the boy who shattered time," is a champion featured in *League of Legends* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He is described as a daredevil genius who uses his inventions to survive and thrive on the corrupted streets of Zaun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Champion Abilities

### Resonance
Triggering Resonance on an enemy champion applies extra damage and a slow effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This ability also grants Ekko a brief movement speed boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Parallel Convergence (W)
Ekko's W ability is called Parallel Convergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Passively, Ekko's basic attacks deal additional magic damage to all low-health enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Phase Dive (E)
Ekko can pass through terrain with both parts of his Phase Dive ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Chrono-Break (R)
When Ekko uses Chrono-Break, he briefly turns untargetable and invulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Upon reappearing, he heals based on the amount of punishment he has taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Gameplay Mechanics and Strategic Tips
[[using_ekkos_time_travel_and_crowd_control_features | Ekko utilizes time travel]] and a variety of crowd control abilities alongside his standard attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. His crowd control tools include stuns, snares, and bolos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Engaging and Disengaging
A strategic approach to eliminate an isolated enemy involves getting in, securing the kill, and getting out before the enemy team can react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This tactic emphasizes quickly striking and then escaping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Combination Plays
One effective combo involves an enemy team passing through a slowing zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. By using Chrono-Break to return to that zone, enemies without vision can walk into Ekko's stun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### General Advice
While [[strategic_tips_for_playing_ekko_effectively | Ekko's abilities]] are powerful, playing Ekko without understanding his mechanics is considered playing him incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Card Sleeves

Custom Chītoge Nisekoi sleeves were opened during an unboxing of a Nisekoi trial deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The sleeves were described as "very beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Their primary purpose during the unboxing was to "properly sleeve up" the foil cards from the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Specific cards that were sleeved included:
*   Kosaki copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
*   A second copy of Chītoge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
*   Ichigo Maxim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>

## Packaging

The Nisekoi trial deck packaging was noted for being "really easy to just slide up and down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The box itself was considered worth keeping, as it might have future value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Tape needed to be removed from the packaging to access the product properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Inside the trial deck box, the 50-card deck and other components were "snugly" packed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, which was similar to the packaging styles seen in [[unboxing_procedure_and_card_arrangement | Yu-Gi-Oh!]] and other TCGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Upon opening the card pack, the cards were noted to have a distinct "great" smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

The speaker, Victor of Concepts and Films, expresses his intention to learn how to play [[introduction_to_wei_schwarz_tcg | Wei Schwarz]] (also known as "WeiÎ² Schwarz" or "Weiss Schwarz") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. He notes he has never played the game before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

## Motivation for Learning
Despite his unfamiliarity, the speaker aims to get started in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. He wishes to learn how to play so he can properly discuss the game without feeling ignorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. He describes [[introduction_to_wei_schwarz_tcg | Wei Schwarz]] as a "very fun" game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a> and a "pretty good TCG game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:27">[09:00:27]</a> that looks like a lot of fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:37">[09:05:37]</a>.

He acquired his first [[introduction_to_wei_schwarz_tcg | Wei Schwarz]] product, a [[wei_schwarz_nisekoi_trial_deck | Nisekoi Trial Deck]], from Sunken Treasures, a local card shop identified as the biggest [[introduction_to_wei_schwarz_tcg | Wei Schwarz]] seller in the Pacific Northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

## Learning Resources
The [[wei_schwarz_nisekoi_trial_deck | Nisekoi Trial Deck]] provides several components to help new players learn the game:
*   **50-Card Deck** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>

The speaker also notes that the packaging style of the trial deck is similar to [[yugioh_card_collecting_strategies | YuGiOh]] and other TCGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">[02:27:06]</a>. He clarifies that he is not opening [[yugioh_card_collecting_strategies | YuGiOh]] TCG or OCG products today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, but plans to continue his [[yugioh_card_collecting_strategies | YuGiOh]] openings in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:35">[09:12:35]</a>.

### Initial Impressions

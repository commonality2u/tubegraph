The launch of *Black Ops 3* saw its release across multiple platforms, including PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and older generation consoles like PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The game's [[comparison_of_pc_and_console_versions | performance across these platforms]] varied significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## PC Version Performance
The PC version of *Black Ops 3* presented several [[Challenges of playing Black Ops 3 on PC | challenges]] at launch. Players noted a "bit of a learning curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> and observed issues with [[Game optimization issues on different platforms | optimization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Hopes were expressed that these issues would be resolved in the weeks following the game's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Specific [[performance_issues_in_gaming | performance issues]] on PC included:
*   Noticeable frame drops during gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   Difficulty finding matches, with one instance requiring five minutes to find a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   The overall sentiment was that the PC version was "pretty shitty" at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Despite these issues, the PC platform was recognized for having the "most competitive demographic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Console Version Performance
In contrast to the PC experience, the PlayStation 4 version of *Black Ops 3* was reported to be "running very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> and was considered "very fun to play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

For older generation consoles, such as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, it was not recommended to purchase the game, as it was considered "not a very good investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The insights are based on a player with significant experience, having played 39 games with Murky and achieved a 26-13 record, reaching Master tier with the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Murky's Core Playstyle and Objectives

Murky's playstyle is primarily focused on pushing lanes and maximizing siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While some objective play is incorporated, the main goal is often to exert pressure on enemy structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. A realistic target for every game is to achieve at least 100,000 siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Murky does not use mana, allowing for continuous ability spamming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

### Battlefield of Eternity Map Strategy
On maps like Battlefield of Eternity, which have only two lanes, Murky's role can shift slightly. While traditional Murky play on other maps involves pushing and less objective participation, the two-lane setup means Murky may need to contribute more to the [[importance_of_map_objectives_in_heroes_of_the_storm | Immortal objective]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

## Recommended Builds and Talents

The primary recommended build for Murky is the [[bubble_build_technique_for_murky | bubble build]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This build emphasizes survivability and mobility, allowing Murky to engage and escape effectively.

### Level 1 Talents
*   **Bubble Breeze (E)**: This talent is chosen for the bubble build, enhancing Murky's safety and evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   *Alternative:* Bribe, while seemingly powerful, is not considered the best option compared to the bubble build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Level 4 Talents
*   **Envenom**: This talent is taken as part of an "assassin" Murky playstyle, allowing for burst damage to deal with enemies attempting to stop Murky's push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Level 7 Talents
*   **Compressed Air (W)**: This talent is crucial for maximizing siege damage with Murky's Pufferfish, allowing it to hit all towers at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Level 10 Talents (Heroic)
*   **Octo-Grab (R)**: This heroic ability allows Murky to disable a single target, facilitating kills in combo with other abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It has a surprisingly low cooldown for its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>.

### Level 16 Talents
*   **Rejuvenating Bubble (E)**: This talent enhances Murky's survivability by providing significant healing when using the Bubble ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
*   *Alternative:* Slimey Pufferfish (W) is an option for increased damage, causing Pufferfish to cast Slime at its location, dealing more damage to slimes targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## Strategic Tips for Murky Play

[[tips_for_improving_strategy_and_siege_damage_with_murky | Tips for improving strategy and siege damage with Murky]] include:

*   **Egg Placement**: Always place Murky's egg in a hidden spot that is difficult for enemies to find, such as behind a fort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   **Bubble Usage**:
    *   Maintain your bubble ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   Use it to escape snares, knock-ups, or other crowd control effects to stay alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   Good reaction times are essential for effective bubble use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   **Pufferfish Combos**: Combine Pufferfish (W) with other abilities like Slime (Q) for increased damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Health Regeneration**: Murky's health regeneration, especially from the "sippy cup" (fountain), is very strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Survivability**: While some Murky players adopt a "suicidal" playstyle, prioritizing staying alive is generally more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

*   **Movement Speed**: Picking up a 20% move speed buff can prevent enemies from easily catching and killing Murky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Hero Matchups**: Murky is effective against heroes like Kael'thas, Jaina, Kerrigan, and Nova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. While not a strong duelist, he can still outplay certain opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

The [[minecraft_pocket_edition_080_update_features | Minecraft Pocket Edition 0.8.0 update]], available on iOS and Android, is considered the biggest update for Minecraft Pocket Edition (MCPE) seen so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This free update for existing app owners includes significant visual enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Enhanced Visuals in Version 0.8.0

A major improvement in this update is the ability to adjust the render distance to a much higher setting through the in-game options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Consequently, the overall graphics in the game appear significantly better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The visual quality of MCPE now closely resembles that of the [[pc_versus_console_gameplay_performance | PC version of Minecraft]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

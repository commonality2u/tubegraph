This article details the [[Opening and unboxing experience | unboxing experience]] and product review of a Yu-Gi-Oh! Value Cube by Victor of Concept in Films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Yu-Gi-Oh! Value Cube Overview

The Value Cube is described as containing 25 cards, two booster packs, and five foil cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, this description is noted as "pretty misleading" because each cube actually includes a 40-card deck in addition to the other contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The specific Value Cube reviewed came with the Fairy Structure Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The Value Cube was purchased from [[Target Blister Packs Unboxing | Target]] for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The reviewer noted that the Fairy Structure Deck alone is more expensive than $9.99 online due to a lack of reprints, which has affected its supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This makes the Value Cube a good deal, as it includes the structure deck, two guaranteed booster packs, and a promo pack, which collectively are worth "well over $9.99" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## [[Unboxing experience and challenges | Unboxing Experience]]

The [[Unboxing procedure and card arrangement | unboxing procedure]] began with the removal of styrofoam filler from the packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Upon opening, the Value Cube contained:
*   The Fairy Structure Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   A promo pack from Legendary Collection 5DS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   One holographic card (separate from packs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   Two booster packs: *Judgment of the Light* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> and *Return of the Duelist* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   Another scrunched-up pack containing a Noble Knights Gold Rare card from *Lost Chapter of the Noble Knights* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Challenges in [[Unboxing procedure and card arrangement | Unboxing]]

The reviewer noted significant difficulty in opening the Fairy Structure Deck, describing it as "a pain in the arse to open up" and "super painful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This was considered the "most painful thing" opened on the channel yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Contents and Notable Cards

### Promo Pack
The promo pack included cards such as:
*   Shooting Quasar Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   Fenrir the Nordic Wolf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Stardust Flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Black Rose Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

These were described as "really good reprints" and "pretty good value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Booster Packs
The booster packs, *Return of the Duelist* and *Judgment of the Light*, yielded mostly common and rare cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Notable cards pulled included:
*   Spellbook of Wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
*   Aldo Che Chickalates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>

The pulls from these packs were described as "pretty weak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Fairy Structure Deck
The Fairy Structure Deck contained several notable holographic and common cards:
*   **Holographic cards:** Master Hyperion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, The Agent of Mystery - Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, and The Agent of Miracles - Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Other cards:** Victoria, Athena, Shining Angel, Honest, Cards in the Sky, The Golden Apples, Terraforming, Smashing Ground, Sanctuary in the Sky (two copies), Mausoleum of the Emperor, Divine Punishment, and Solemn Judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:05:14]</a>. Solemn Judgment was noted as being banned in the TCG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Overall Value Assessment

A recap of the "hollows" (foil cards) obtained from the entire Value Cube included:
*   Noble Knight Gold Rare card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>
*   Stardust Flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
*   Fenrir the Nordic Wolf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
*   Nordic Serpent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>
*   Shooting Quasar Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   Black Rose Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   Master Hyperion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   The Agent of Mystery - Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
*   The Agent of Miracles - Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
*   Torrential Tribute (common, but considered strong) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

Despite the poor pulls from the individual booster packs, the overall value of the Value Cube was deemed good for its price, especially considering the included structure deck and promo cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Victor concluded that these "value cubes are not bad for their prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

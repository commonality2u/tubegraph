Observations from gameplay commentary offer limited insights into specific [[montage_and_gameplay_of_lucian_in_league_of_legends | Lucian]] strategies, primarily focusing on player conduct and perceived performance issues rather than detailed [[league_of_legends_gameplay_strategy | gameplay strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Player Expectations and Performance

During a game, there was an expectation that the [[montage_and_gameplay_of_lucian_in_league_of_legends | Lucian]] player should allow teammates to initiate attacks, as expressed by one player stating, "Lucia should just let me ATT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This suggests a desire for [[montage_and_gameplay_of_lucian_in_league_of_legends | Lucian]] to potentially play a more enabling or follow-up role rather than being the primary aggressor in certain situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

However, the [[montage_and_gameplay_of_lucian_in_league_of_legends | Lucian]] player's overall performance was met with criticism, being labeled a "Lucien scrub" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This negative assessment escalated to calls for the player to be reported due to perceived poor play or inactivity, with comments like "Lucien report eat or be four keyboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

From: [[kuanceptionfilms]] <br/> 

The primary objective of a Yosenju deck is to "spam" normal summons, as the deck does not rely on special summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This focus on normal summoning is a core aspect of the deck's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Key Monsters for Normal Summoning

*   **Yosenju Kama 1**: This card allows you to normal summon additional Yosenju monsters, effectively acting as a "double summon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It can also send any face-up card your opponent controls back to their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Kama 2**: Similar to Kama 1, this card also allows you to normal summon another Yosenju card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Additionally, Kama 2 can attack your opponent directly for half damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Kama 3**: This card is highly effective when chained with Kama 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. When another Yosenju card on the field deals damage to your opponent (like Kama 2's direct attack), Kama 3 allows you to search a Yosenju card from your deck and add it to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This combination effectively provides another normal summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. You can use this effect to add Yosenju Suijin to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Suijin**: When normal summoned, Suijin can target another Yosenju card on the field, causing it to gain 1000 attack points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Its first effect, usable by discarding it, is similar to "Honest," allowing a Yosenju monster to gain 1000 ATK during the damage step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Support Spells

*   **Pot of Duality**: This spell is highly effective in a Yosenju deck because the deck does not special summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. It allows you to look at the top three cards of your deck, choose one to add to your hand, though you cannot special summon for the rest of that turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This restriction is inconsequential for a deck focused on normal summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

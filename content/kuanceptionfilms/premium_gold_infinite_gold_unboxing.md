[[Opening and unboxing experience | Unboxing]] the Premium Gold Infinite Gold product reveals a visually striking set. While the product is named "Infinite Gold," the box art for this year's release appears "quite red" and "very royal," conveying a "dank" aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The product is described as "very exciting every year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The video documenting this [[unboxing_and_review | unboxing]] was filmed on Saturday, March 19th, shortly after the product's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This marked the first Yugioh product the presenter had interacted with in "like two weeks, three weeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Expected Reprints

A primary goal of the [[unboxing_and_rare_cards | unboxing]] is to pull "great reprints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Anticipated [[Yugioh card reprints in Premium Gold | reprints]] include:
*   "Dank Exis cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   "Dank pendulum reprints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   "Really good Cosmo cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   "Nice trap cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>

Specific cards hoped for include Mass Change, Monarch Storm Corpse, Gagaga Cowboy, and Cosmo Dark Destroyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. While the [[Yugioh card reprints in Premium Gold | reprints]] are exciting, it's noted that Konami "is kind of screwing us with those reprints that's killing the market value of the currents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Unboxing Contents and Pulls

The box contains three packs, with five cards in each pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The gold foiling on the cards is highly praised, making them look "really really really nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The single box provided "some pretty dank cars" and "so many great cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The [[Yugioh card reprints in Premium Gold | reprints]] were deemed "freaking sexy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Mass Change will be used to replace a common version in a Hero deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. More Yugioh videos, including an [[Opening and unboxing experience | unboxing]] of a full display box (five boxes) of Premium Gold, are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

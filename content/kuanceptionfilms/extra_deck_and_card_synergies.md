The Anti-Meta Troll Deck, built for under $30, is designed as a troll, anti-meta, burn, and lockdown deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. It functions as a Trap Tricks Gravekeepers deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. While the main deck focuses on control and disruption, the Extra Deck provides crucial support, offering flexible options and key synergies to achieve its objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Extra Deck Overview

The Extra Deck for this build is described as flexible, allowing players to run any Rank 4 Xyz monsters they prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. However, some cards are considered essential for the deck's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

## Key Extra Deck Cards

### Lavalval Chain
Lavalval Chain is highlighted as an essential Rank 4 Xyz monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. Its primary synergy in this deck is to place Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo on top of the deck, enabling the lockdown strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. It can also be useful for milling cards if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

### Number 101: Silent Honor ARK
This card is also considered essential due to its "broken effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. It serves as a strong defensive Rank 4 Xyz monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

### Number 50: Blackship of Corn
Number 50: Blackship of Corn offers a good effect, allowing the player to deal 1000 damage each turn if the opponent controls a monster with less attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

### Number 55: Gogogo Goliath
This is noted as a temporary inclusion in the Extra Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>, indicating the flexibility of the build.

### Number 39: Utopia
Number 39: Utopia is mentioned as an essential Rank 4 Xyz card for "any deck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

### Stardust Dragon
While the deck does not contain any tuners to naturally summon Stardust Dragon, it is included in the Extra Deck specifically to enable the special summon of Malefic Stardust Dragon from the main deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. This provides extra attack power without taking up main deck space, especially likely to occur when a field card is on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.

### Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
The player intends to add Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon to the Extra Deck once the Mega Tin comes out, as they currently lack the funds to buy its un-reprinted copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. This further emphasizes the flexible nature of the Extra Deck lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

## Card Synergies with the Main Deck

The Extra Deck's effectiveness relies heavily on specific main deck cards that facilitate the summoning of Rank 4 Xyz monsters:

*   **Summoner Monk**: This card is crucial for getting out Level 4 monsters, which are then used to summon Rank 4 Xyz monsters from the Extra Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Kagetokage**: Its effect allows it to be special summoned from the hand when a Level 4 monster is normal summoned, providing an instant second monster for an Xyz summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Gravekeeper's Spy**: When flipped face-up, this card can special summon another Gravekeeper's monster with 1500 or less attack from the deck, automatically setting up two Level 4 monsters for an Xyz summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Malefic Stardust Dragon**: As mentioned, this main deck monster directly synergizes with Stardust Dragon in the Extra Deck, providing a high-attack body without requiring the Extra Deck monster to be summoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. This works well with the numerous field cards included in the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo**: While not an Extra Deck card itself, its lockdown effect is crucial to the deck's strategy and is synergized with Lavalval Chain to ensure it gets on the field or to the hand efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. When Fossil Dyna is combined with [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | Trap Cards]] like Trap Hole, the opponent can be effectively locked down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

The combination of easily accessible Level 4 monsters and the specific utility of cards like Lavalval Chain ensures the deck's ability to establish powerful Xyz monsters and lockdown strategies.

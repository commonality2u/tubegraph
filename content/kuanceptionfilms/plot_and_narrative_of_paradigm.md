[[Overview of Paradigm gameplay | Paradigm]] is a point-and-click adventure game available in English and Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Premise

The game opens with an infomercial for "Dupa" from "Giro del Genetics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This company claims to transform "pathologic child[ren]" into "lovable child[ren] of your dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> using "broken dreams," "cutting-edge genetic sequencing technology," and a "secret sauce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. They boast of creating children who can become "scientist[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> or "wizard[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The protagonist, [[characters_in_paradigm | Paradigm]], is a product of Giro del Genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. He has a "weird-lookin looking hand thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> and a notable frog-like growth on his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. His backstory is implied to involve being "all drugged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Core Conflict and Early Goals

[[characters_in_paradigm | Paradigm]]'s immediate goal is to finish his new EP (Extended Play record) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This requires getting his computer, named "John" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, to work properly. John's operating system is "bugging" and needs to be "reinstalled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Initial Puzzle Elements

To resolve the computer issue, [[characters_in_paradigm | Paradigm]] must:
*   Find a "piggy" to reinstall the operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Plug John in, as he is initially not turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

During this process, [[characters_in_paradigm | Paradigm]] encounters a character identified as "Hal 9000" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, a reference to *2001: A Space Odyssey*. Hal reveals the need for the operating system to be reinstalled and implies that the "piggy" is somewhere in [[characters_in_paradigm | Paradigm]]'s possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Narrative Progression (Alpha Demo)

The player must navigate the environment, which includes [[characters_in_paradigm | Paradigm]]'s room with a bed and a shrine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The shrine features "Dr. Jesus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> and a record collection purchased from a "talking dog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, suggesting a European setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

A key item found is a "postcard map" inside a mailbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, which is described as "wrongly delivered mail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This map leads to another character, referred to as "the basic idiot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, who is "drooling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> and potentially not wearing pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Delivering the map to this character completes the "alpha demo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

The game also features a robotic character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> who might be smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

The completion of the demo reveals that the game was created approximately two years prior to the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a> and was part of a Kickstarter campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. An area shown on the map is still "under development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

The Yu-Gi-Oh! Traptrix deck, specifically in its December 2015 "ring force spam" iteration, focuses on rapidly summoning [[rank_4_and_rank_5_xyz_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Rank 4 and Rank 5 Xyz monsters]] while maintaining a strong [[building_an_effective_back_row_defense in Traptrix deck | back row defense]] using its signature [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | Trap Cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The deck utilizes various draw power engines to achieve consistency and quickly gather key cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Core Strategy

The primary objective of this Traptrix deck is to leverage draw power to quickly access "Trap Trick" cards, enabling the rapid summoning of [[rank_4_and_rank_5_xyz_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Rank 4 and Rank 5 Xyz monsters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Simultaneously, it aims to establish a robust [[building_an_effective_back_row_defense in Traptrix deck | back row defense]] through the use of numerous [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | Trap Cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Key Deck Components & Their Roles

### Monsters

The monster line-up in this Traptrix build is geared towards searching, special summoning, and providing Xyz material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

*   **Traptrix Myrmeleo (x3)**: This [[key_monster_cards_in_traptrix_deck_2015 | monster]] is crucial for searching "Bottomless Trap Hole" and other "Trap Hole" cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. When special summoned from the graveyard, it can destroy any spell or trap card on the field, acting like a "Mystical Space Typhoon" (MST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Traptrix Dionaea (x3)**: "Dionaea" can special summon any Traptrix monster from the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. When special summoned from the graveyard itself, it allows the player to reuse "Trap Hole" cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Assault Halberd (x3)**: This card can be special summoned if the player controls no monsters and the opponent controls a monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. When it attacks and deals damage, it allows the player to add another "Assault Halberd" to their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. It's a Level 4 monster that inflicts piercing damage when attacking defense position monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Spells

Spell cards are primarily used for draw power, monster revival, and removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

*   **Raigeki (x1)**: Standard monster board wipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Soul Charge (x1)**: Powerful monster revival card, very strong in the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Pot of Duality (x1)**: Contributes to draw power and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Upstart Goblin (x3)**: A standard card for maximum consistency and draw power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Instant Fusion (x3)**: Used to summon "Norden," which is essential for making [[rank_4_and_rank_5_xyz_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Rank 4 Xyz plays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Terraforming (x3)** & **Chicken Game (x3)** & **Pseudo Space (x2)**: This combination provides significant draw power. "Chicken Game" is an excellent draw mechanic, and "Pseudo Space" acts as additional copies of "Chicken Game" due to the presence of "Terraforming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon (MST) (x3)**: Standard spell/trap removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Traps

The trap line-up is critical for the deck's defensive capabilities and controlling the opponent's board, embodying the [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | Trap Card Strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

*   **Solemn Warning (x1)**: A standard negation card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Bottomless Trap Hole (x1)**: Standard banishing trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

These can be searched by "Myrmeleo" and reused by "Dionaea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device (x1)**: A versatile bounce effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

*   **Vanity's Emptiness (x1)**: Prevents opponents from special summoning, effectively stopping their plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

It can also bring out "Fishtron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Fishtron (x1)**: Negates effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

*   **Tellar Knight Ptolemaeus (x1)**: Used to summon [[rank_4_and_rank_5_xyz_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Rank 5 Xyz monsters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

*   **Number 61: Volcasaurus (x1)**: A good burn card and a strong [[rank_4_and_rank_5_xyz_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Rank 5 monster]], typically summoned via "Ptolemaeus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Constellar Pleiades (x1)**: Can return a card to the opponent's hand, functioning as an "Instant Compulsory Evacuation Device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon (x1)**, **Heroic Champion - Excalibur (x1)**, **Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer (x1)**, **Gagaga Cowboy (x1)**: These are standard, generally useful [[rank_4_and_rank_5_xyz_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Rank 4 Xyz monsters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Elder Entity Norden (x3)**: Crucial for getting out "Ptolemaeus," [[rank_4_and_rank_5_xyz_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Rank 5 Xyz monsters]], and "Delteros" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

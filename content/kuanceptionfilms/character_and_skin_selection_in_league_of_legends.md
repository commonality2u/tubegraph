## Champion Selection and Counter-picking

In [[League of Legends | League of Legends]] gameplay, players often discuss champion selection strategies. One player suggests picking [[brand_gameplay_strategies_in_league_of_legends | Brand]], believing the champion "counters any anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The effectiveness of [[brand_gameplay_strategies_in_league_of_legends | Brand]] is highlighted by the potential for strong crowd control, as players note, "we can chain CC them so hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Skin Boosts and Identification Challenges

The concept of "skin boosts" is mentioned within the game context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In certain [[league_of_legends_gameplay | League of Legends gameplay]] scenarios, such as when multiple players select the same champion (e.g., "all Brand"), challenges arise in distinguishing characters, leading to questions like "are we supposed to know which Brand is marked if we're all Brand?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This highlights [[gameplay_dynamics_with_unconventional_skins | gameplay dynamics with unconventional skins]] or modes that impact player identification. One specific skin observation made is about a character having "a gas mask on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Champion Balancing and Disabling

Discussions around champion balance are also present. The idea of a champion like [[brand_gameplay_strategies_in_league_of_legends | Brand]] being disabled due to strong abilities, specifically "his stupid chain CC," is raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The game's balancing efforts are acknowledged, with a player stating, "it's balancing the Brand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The 2014 holiday season was marred by significant [[gaming_performance_and_technical_challenges | network outages]] that caused widespread [[gamers_reactions_and_commentary | frustration]] for console [[gaming_community_reactions | gamers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The primary cause of this disruption was a group known as Lizard Squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Lizard Squad Outages

Xbox Live and PlayStation Network (PSN), described as "pretty crappy Network Services to begin with," experienced consistent downtime over several weeks leading up to the holidays due to constant hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for these "pointless hacks" on both major [[gaming_discussions | gaming]] platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The group, characterized as "acne-ridden 17-year-olds with too much Doritos and Mountain Dew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, frequently tweeted threats to Sony and Microsoft, promising to take down PSN and Xbox Live, and often succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Confusion and Continued Attacks

A week before the Christmas outages, another group of anonymous hackers, "The Finest Squad," claimed to have taken down Lizard Squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This claim, however, was contradicted when Lizard Squad successfully took down PSN and Xbox Live again on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This ongoing disruption during a peak [[gaming_as_entertainment | gaming]] period left many bewildered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Impact on Holiday Gamers

The timing of these attacks was particularly impactful, affecting children who received new consoles for Christmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. An illustrative example depicts a 12-year-old child, already prone to anger after receiving a white PS4 Destiny bundle instead of a black PS4 with Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The additional frustration of logging on to a non-existent PlayStation Network on Christmas Day would likely be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

It was suggested that Lizard Squad's motivations for these hacks were simply boredom, rather than a specific reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Despite the widespread annoyance, the situation was noted to be "not as annoying as Anita Sarkeesian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

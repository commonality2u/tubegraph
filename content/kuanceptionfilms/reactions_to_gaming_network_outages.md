The network outages experienced by [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live]] and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | PlayStation Network]] during the holiday season made it difficult for some console gamers to enjoy their time [00:00:13]. The primary cause identified for these disruptions was the hacking group [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] [00:00:17].

## Criticisms and Frustration
Prior to the major incidents, both [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live]] and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | PlayStation Network]] were already perceived as "pretty crappy Network Services" [00:00:51]. In the weeks leading up to Christmas, both networks consistently experienced downtime due to ongoing hacking activities [00:00:55].

There was significant confusion and criticism regarding Sony and Microsoft's inability to defend their networks [00:01:20]. The speaker expressed bewilderment that the two largest [[gaming_culture_and_community | gaming]] networks in the world could not protect themselves against a seemingly small group of hackers [00:01:24]. The repeated success of [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] in taking down [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | PSN]] and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live]], especially after another group, Finest Squad, claimed to have taken [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] down, caused further confusion [00:01:45]. The fact that [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] managed to bring down the networks again on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day left the speaker with "mind bombs" [00:02:10].

## Impact on Gamers
The outages led to significant disappointment, especially for those receiving new consoles during the holidays. A hypothetical scenario described a 12-year-old child receiving a new white PS4 Destiny bundle for Christmas [00:02:16]. Despite receiving a new console, the child was initially dissatisfied, having wanted a black PlayStation with Call of Duty Advanced Warfare [00:02:21].

The speaker then highlighted the extreme anger the child would likely feel upon logging into [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | PlayStation Network]] only to find it unavailable on Christmas Day [00:02:45]. This illustrates the potential for intense negative [[reaction_to_video_games | reaction to video games]] and disappointment caused by the network outages.

Furthermore, there was frustration that [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] seemingly lacked a clear reason for their actions, implying their motives were simply boredom [00:02:59].

Victor of Quant Ception Films presented a [[yugioh_pack_opening_experience | YuGiOh pack opening]] video featuring the 2015 *Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon Mega Tin* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This followed a previous opening of the *Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon Mega Tin*, where a significant card, Dante, was pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. That initial Dante pull was noted as particularly lucky, being the first 2015 mega tin opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The speaker expressed doubt that the luck from the previous opening could be topped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

The 2015 *Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon Mega Tin* includes one promo pack containing two super rares and the platinum secret rare *Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Unexpected Duplicate Pull

During the opening, the speaker pulled a second Dante, the same rare card pulled from the previous mega tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This was described as a "duplicate pack" and an incredible stroke of luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, with the speaker stating, "This is my second Dante in a row, second tin, second Dante" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Additional [[pulling_rare_yugioh_cards | rare pulls]] observed after the second Dante:
*   El Shaddoll Winda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>
*   Magical Spring (secret rare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
*   Number 39: Utopia Beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>
*   Despot Double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>
*   Utopia Prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>

The speaker emphasized the unlikelihood of scaling these packs, as they were mega packs contained within a mega tin, concluding that two tins yielded two Dantes, indicating "insane" luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

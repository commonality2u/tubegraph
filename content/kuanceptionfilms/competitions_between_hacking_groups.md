The gaming community has observed instances where different hacking groups appear to be in conflict or competition with each other, particularly concerning the targeting of major online gaming networks like Xbox Live and PlayStation Network (PSN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Featured Groups

### [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]]
[[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] is a group that has claimed responsibility for various cyberattacks on major gaming networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The group is often described by the speaker as likely comprising "acne ridden 17-year-olds with too much Doritos and Mountain Dew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. They have consistently tweeted threats to Sony and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> and have reportedly succeeded in taking down PSN and Xbox Live on multiple occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, including during Christmas Eve and Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. These hacks are perceived as "pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> and without a clear reason, possibly driven by boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Finest Squad
Finest Squad is another group of "anonymous hackers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This group claimed to have taken down [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] approximately one week before new outages occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Apparent Conflict and Confusion
Despite Finest Squad's claim to have incapacitated [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] subsequently took down PSN and Xbox Live again on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This sequence of events has led to confusion regarding the effectiveness of Finest Squad's actions or the nature of the alleged competition between the groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

> "A different group of anonymous hackers known as the finest Squad claimed to have taken down [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] about a week ago... why the goat mom did [[lizard_squad_hacking_incidents | Lizard Squad]] just take down PSN and Xbox Live Again on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>

### Impact on Gamers
The repeated network outages, regardless of the hacking group responsible, significantly impact gamers, particularly during holiday seasons. For example, a child receiving a new console for Christmas would be unable to access online features if the networks are down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The inability of major companies like Sony and Microsoft to defend their "largest gaming networks in the world" against these groups is a source of frustration for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

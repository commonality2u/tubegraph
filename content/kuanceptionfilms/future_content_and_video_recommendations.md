Victor, also known as Quan Inception Films, uses his platform to engage with his audience regarding both past content and future offerings.

## Addressing Content Gaps
Victor acknowledged a period of inactivity in uploading console gameplays, apologizing to his viewers for the absence of such content over several weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This interruption was due to a malfunction with his Elgato game capture device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The creation of the featured video was made possible by Seth, the channel's co-owner, who lent his Elgato game capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, suggesting a return to more consistent uploads. This instance highlights [[victors_consistency_with_video_uploads | Victor's consistency with video uploads]].

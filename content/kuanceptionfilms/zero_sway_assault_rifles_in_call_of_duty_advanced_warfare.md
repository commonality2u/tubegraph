In [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Call of Duty Advanced Warfare]], assault rifles exhibit a unique characteristic: they have zero sway when aiming down sights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This contrasts with previous *Call of Duty* titles, where assault rifles typically had at least some degree of sway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Impact and Player Perception
While this "no sway" feature might seem overpowered, many players may not notice a significant difference during gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. The game demonstrates this characteristic with weapons like the IMR and the BOW, confirming that neither weapon sways when aimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

### Contrast with Sniper Rifles
Conversely, sniper rifles in [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Call of Duty Advanced Warfare]] feature extreme amounts of sway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This design choice puts snipers at a disadvantage, a change that was seemingly implemented in response to player requests for "sniper nerfs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. As a result, quick scoping has become considerably more challenging in this installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

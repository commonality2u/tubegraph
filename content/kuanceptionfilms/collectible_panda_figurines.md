A "panda bundle" can be obtained from a specific box, featuring three rare panda figurines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The speaker is a collector of such figurines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Types of Panda Figurines

The bundle includes:
*   **Traditional Bumblebee Panda** This figurine features two black stripes, black ears, and circles around its eyes, resembling a raccoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Ultra Rare Panda Figurine** This figurine is considered "ultra rare" and caused the speaker to remake part of the video due to excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Despite being broken and jingling inside, it is still valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The speaker estimates it could be sold for about "two sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Small but Mighty Panda Figurine** Though small, this figurine is described as "mighty powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. It is said to clear an entire [[yugioh_card_collecting_strategies | Yu-Gi-Oh]] battle arena of cards, figurines, wax figures, and bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Its effect is stated to combine with a blue 10 or 25 League of Legends RP card, allowing the player to win the game if placed on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

The speaker believes that obtaining the panda set leads to the most rare set one could ever acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

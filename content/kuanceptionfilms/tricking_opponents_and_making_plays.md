Playing effectively involves outmaneuvering opponents through clever [[ingame_strategies_and_tactics | tactics]] and executing impactful plays.

## Early Game Tactics

In the early game, an aggressive approach can secure a strong start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A key play involves standing near the opposing team's buff at the start of the lane phase to support your jungler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This can make your champion feel "overpowered" even without abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Deceiving Opponents

Opponents can sometimes be tricked into making poor decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. An example given is tricking them into placing a ward at their Krugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Executing "MLG Plays"

Concealment is vital for making significant plays. Hiding in a top bush can create opportunities for "MLG plays" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. An effective "Wombo Combo" can reduce an enemy's health by half at level one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Upon reaching level three, it's possible to "all in" an enemy and secure a kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Mid-to-Late Game Strategies

### Objective Control

Stealing the jungler's blue buff should be executed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. When opponents attempt to secure a dragon, stealing the objective is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Tower Pressure

Mid turrets can be destroyed from 100% health to 0% using powerful auto attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Opponent Behavior

It is suggested that sometimes opponents might make mistakes, essentially "killing themselves" because they anticipate their demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Ignoring ganks from the opposing jungler might be beneficial, as they might unintentionally "steal" your kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

However, be wary of opponents seemingly "hacking," particularly when observing abilities like [[strategies_for_playing_ekko | Ekko]]'s Q, which might appear to do no damage, yet the player is still effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

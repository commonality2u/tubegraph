YuGiOh card collecting often revolves around acquiring specific products and hoping for rare pulls. The thrill of the [[yugioh_pack_opening_experience | pack opening experience]] is a significant aspect of this hobby.

## Targeting Specific Products
Collectors may target specific products like Mega Tins for their guaranteed promotional cards and the chance to pull valuable reprints or new cards. The 2015 Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon Megatin, for instance, includes a promo pack containing two Super Rares and a Platinum Secret Rare Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. These tins are valued for providing "mega packs inside of a mega tin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Desired Card Pulls
When opening products, collectors often have a wish list of cards they hope to acquire. Some highly sought-after cards mentioned include:
*   Dante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   Stellar Knight Exies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

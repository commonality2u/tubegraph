The video focuses on the use of the EXO Shield in [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Call of Duty Advanced Warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The creator, Conception Films, was inspired by a video from Drifter about the EXO Shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, specifically his "EXO Shield inep video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This inspiration led Conception Films to "become the turtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, a term used to describe the playstyle associated with the EXO Shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

The video itself is a [[montage_of_call_of_duty_advanced_warfare_gameplay | montage of Call of Duty Advanced Warfare gameplay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, showcasing the creator's "greatest moments while being the turtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> using the EXO Shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It serves as a tribute to Drifter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

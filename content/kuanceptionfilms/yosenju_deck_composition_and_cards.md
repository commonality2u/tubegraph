The [[yosenju_budget_deck_strategies | Yosenju]] deck is presented as a strong budget option, potentially buildable for under $40, or even under $30 if the extra deck is disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It is considered one of the best budget decks available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, capable of dealing heavy damage to most tier one decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The primary goal of this deck is to spam normal summons, rarely utilizing special summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Main Deck

### Monsters

*   **Yosenju Kama 1** (3 copies)
    *   Effect: Returns any face-up card your opponent controls back to their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   Synergy: Allows for additional [[normal_summoning_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | Normal Summons]] of Yosenju cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, acting as a "double summon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Kama 2** (3 copies)
    *   Effect: Allows you to attack your opponent directly for half damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   Synergy: Also allows for additional [[normal_summoning_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | Normal Summons]] of Yosenju cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Kama 3** (3 copies)
    *   Effect: When another Yosenju card on the field deals damage to your opponent, you can search a Yosenju card from your deck and add it to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   Synergy: Combos effectively with Yosenju Kama 2's direct attack effect to trigger searches and facilitate more [[normal_summoning_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | Normal Summons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Tsujik** (3 copies)
    *   Effect 1: Discard to have a Yosenju monster gain 1000 ATK during the damage step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Effect 2: If [[normal_summoning_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | Normal Summoned]], target one Yosenju card on the field to gain 1000 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   Purpose: A multi-purpose card providing both "Honest"-like and "Dark Grepher"-like effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Shinchu L** (2 copies)
    *   Type: Pendulum monster, though the deck is not a pendulum build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   Effect: As a pendulum card, if a Yosenju monster you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can destroy this card instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   Synergy: Can be comboed with Yosenju Secret Move for [[defensive_and_offensive_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | defensive measures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Cardcar D** (3 copies)
    *   Purpose: Provides excellent draw power for the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Spell Cards

*   **Fire Formation - Tenki** (quantity not specified, but implied to be 3)
    *   Effect: Continuous spell allowing you to search your deck for a Yosenju monster and all your Beast-Warrior monsters gain 100 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
    *   Purpose: Good draw power and ATK boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Dimensional Fissure** (quantity not specified)
    *   Effect: Any monster sent to the graveyard is banished instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   Purpose: A floodgate card that doesn't affect the Yosenju strategy because they don't rely on the graveyard or special summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Effective against decks like Shaddolls and Heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Book of Moon** (2 copies)
    *   Purpose: An essential card for any deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon (MST)** (2 copies)
    *   Purpose: An essential card for back row removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Pot of Duality** (3 copies)
    *   Effect: Look at the top three cards of your deck, add one to your hand, then shuffle the rest back; you cannot special summon for the rest of the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   Purpose: Heavily abused in this deck as the "no special summon" restriction doesn't impact Yosenju's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Upstart Goblin** (quantity not specified)
    *   Purpose: Provides great draw power and helps thin the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Dark Hole** (2 copies)
    *   Purpose: Board wipe that doesn't harm the Yosenju player because Yosenju monsters return to the hand at the end of the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Trap Cards

*   **Yosenju Secret Move** (3 copies)
    *   Effect: When a spell/trap card or monster effect is activated while you control at least one Yosenju monster (or all face-up monsters you control are Yosenju monsters), negate the activation and destroy that card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   Synergy: Can be activated even if you only have Yosenju Shinchu L in your pendulum zone, as no monsters are controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Vanity's Emptiness** (quantity not specified)
    *   Effect: Another floodgate that prevents special summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   Purpose: Abused in this deck as Yosenju does not special summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Bottomless Trap Hole** (quantity not specified)
    *   Purpose: An essential trap card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device (Compulse)** (quantity not specified)
    *   Purpose: An essential trap card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Mirror Force** (2 copies)
    *   Purpose: Provides [[defensive_and_offensive_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | defensive measures]], especially useful when the field is empty on the opponent's turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

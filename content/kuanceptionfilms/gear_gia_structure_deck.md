The [[Gravekeeper structure deck|Gear Gia Structure Deck]] is featured as part of a "Tank Value Cube" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While the product packaging suggests it contains 25 cards and two booster packs, the included [[Gravekeeper structure deck|Gear Gia Structure Deck]] itself contains more than 25 cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It is described as having "dank cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> and "some may stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

The speaker notes that they had never personally bought a [[Gravekeeper structure deck|Gear Gia Structure Deck]] before, not being particularly interested in the archetype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. They found the cards to look like "a boat ship" and considered them "ugly," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> though they acknowledge that the archetype was "pleasing" and "almost topping" or "even topping" competitively at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

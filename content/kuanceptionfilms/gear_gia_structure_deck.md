The [[yugioh_structure_decks_and_starter_decks_comparison | Geargia Structure Deck]] was featured as part of a "value cube" opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. It is noted to contain "pretty dank cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Archetype Overview
The presenter had not previously purchased a [[yugioh_structure_decks_and_starter_decks_comparison | Geargia Structure Deck]] and wasn't initially "into the archetype" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. They found the cards visually unappealing, describing them as looking "like a boat ship because they're so ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Despite this, the Geargia archetype was at one point considered a "pleasing archetype" that was "almost hopping or even topping" in competitive play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. The presenter noted a break from playing Yu-Gi-Oh! for a couple of years during that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

In an unboxing of a Primal Origin Korean OCG booster box, various rare Yu-Gi-Oh! cards were pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. The unboxers aimed to find specific cards like Bujin cards and [[seal_of_orichalcos_and_other_ultra_rare_cards | Galaxy-Eyes Photon cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>.

    *   Other unnamed rare cards were also found throughout the [[mega_packs_contents_and_card_pulls | pack openings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:46">[03:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:15">[03:49:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:24">[03:51:24]</a>.

### Overview of Rare Cards Obtained

In total, the [[overview_and_recap_of_rare_cards_obtained | rare Yugioh card pulls]] from the booster box included four Super Rares, one Ultra Rare, and two [[yugioh_secret_and_prismatic_rares | Prismatic Rare cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.

Despite hoping for more "hollows" (foil cards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:19">[11:37:19]</a>, there were instances where packs did not contain a rare or hollow card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:07">[08:26:07]</a>. This contributed to the overall experience of [[finding_ultra_rare_yugioh_cards | pulling rare Yugioh cards]].

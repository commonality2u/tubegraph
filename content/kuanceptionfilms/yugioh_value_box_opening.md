[[YuGiOh value cube opening | Yugioh value cube opening]] typically involve a variety of products at a competitive price point, as demonstrated by an [[Opening a Yugioh Value Cube | opening of a Yugioh Value Cube]] from Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Value Cube Contents and Purchase
A specific value cube purchased for $9.99 at [[Yugioh card opening at Target | Target]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> was described as containing 25 cards, two booster packs, and five foil cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, the actual contents included a 40-card deck in addition to the 25 cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This particular cube came with the "Fairy Structure Deck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, which, at the time, was more expensive online than the entire value cube due to a lack of reprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The value proposition of these cubes is considered good, as the cost of a structure deck alone is typically $9.99, and the cube guarantees additional booster and promo packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Unboxing Experience and Card Pulls
The unboxing process for the value cube revealed:
*   Styrofoam filler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   The Fairy Structure Deck itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   A promo pack from Legendary Collection 5DS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, containing cards like Shooting Quasar Dragon, Fenrir the Nordic Wolf, and Black Rose Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   A "Return of the Duels" booster pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   A "Judgment of the Light" booster pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   A "Lost Chapter of the Noble Knights" pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, which was noted to be for a Noble Knights structure deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

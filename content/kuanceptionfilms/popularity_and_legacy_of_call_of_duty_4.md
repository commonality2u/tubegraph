Call of Duty 4 is widely regarded as one of the most significant and beloved entries in the Call of Duty franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It is described as "the purest and arguably the best Call of Duty game" by many fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Enduring Appeal
The game offered an amazing multiplayer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Many players had "tons of fun" with Call of Duty 4 in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, and it's stated that "every Call of Duty fan loved Cod 4" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This classic multiplayer experience remains highly sought after by players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Challenges to Continued Playability
Despite its strong legacy, the enjoyment of Call of Duty 4 on older consoles like the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 has been significantly hampered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Server Issues
The [[condition_of_call_of_duty_4_servers|condition of Call of Duty 4's servers]] is a major problem, with thousands of examples demonstrating how broken they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Infinity Ward developers are criticized for not addressing these server conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This issue also affects other classic titles like Modern Warfare 2 and World at War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### [[impact_of_hackers_on_call_of_duty_games|Impact of Hackers]]
A primary reason for the poor server conditions is the prevalence of hackers, boosters, and other forms of "BS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This makes it nearly impossible to find a playable lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, forcing players to resort to games like Black Ops 2 or Modern Warfare 3 for a better experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Desire for a Remaster
Due to the difficulties in playing older Call of Duty titles and potential disappointment with newer releases like Call of Duty Ghosts or [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare|Advanced Warfare]], there's a strong demand for modern remasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Call of Duty 4 HD Remaster
A major proposal is an [[call_of_duty_4_remastered_for_ps4_and_xbox_one|HD remaster of Call of Duty 4]] for the PS4 and Xbox One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Such a remaster would feature enhanced graphics and, crucially, brand new, playable servers free from hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Potential Release Model
Ideally, this remastered game would be released digitally on platforms like the PlayStation Store and Xbox, potentially followed a year later by a Modern Warfare 2 HD remaster released in the same manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While such a release might divert sales from [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare|Advanced Warfare]] and [[future_possibilities_for_call_of_duty_franchises|other future Call of Duty games]], many fans believe it would be a worthwhile endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Rushing effectively on maps like Nuketown and Combine in *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* can be achieved with specific weapon choices, notably the Brecci shotgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The Brecci is highlighted for its effectiveness in aggressive gameplay, enabling players to achieve "dank streaks" and have fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Brecci Shotgun

The Brecci is a semi-automatic shotgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It is considered by some to be the best shotgun in the game, and arguably even the best overall gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Its powerful nature is described as "very OP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Ease of Use
A key characteristic of the Brecci is its accessibility; any new player ("noob") can pick it up and perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This makes it an ideal weapon for those looking to engage in aggressive, close-quarters combat and "do the tanking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Preferred Maps and Game Modes

When [[using_the_brecci_shotgun_effectively | using the Brecci]] for rushing, the maps Nuketown and Combine are frequently chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Gameplay compilations often feature "best rushing moments" with the Brecci on these specific maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### PC Performance Considerations
On PC, a higher frame rate (e.g., 120 FPS) can provide an advantage for rushing players, benefiting those who engage in aggressive playstyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Lobbies may also include less experienced players, sometimes referred to as "Christmas noobs," which can make rushing strategies even more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

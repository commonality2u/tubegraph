*Paradigm* is identified as a point-and-click adventure game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The game offers language options, including English and Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Core Gameplay
The primary interaction method involves clicking on objects and characters in the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Right-clicking is used to interact with characters or inspect objects, such as attempting to talk to "John" or examine a "wah pedal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Keyboard input is also used for some interactions, though specific keys are not detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Puzzles and Objectives
Player progression often involves solving environmental puzzles and completing objectives:
*   **Fixing John Computer** – An early task requires the player to plug in the "John computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Reinstalling Operating System** – The "John computer" requires its operating system to be reinstalled due to bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This requires finding "floppy disks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Mail Delivery** – A key objective involves finding and delivering a "postcard map" to a character named "Doug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, which is necessary to complete the alpha demo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The map allows for exploring different areas of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Game State and Progression
The experience shown is an "alpha demo" of *Paradigm*, which can be finished by completing specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The demo concludes upon delivering the map to Doug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, but players can continue to explore the world using the map afterward, noting that certain areas are "still under development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

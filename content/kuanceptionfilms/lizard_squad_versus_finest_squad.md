The holiday season saw significant disruption for console gamers due to network outages on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. These disruptions were attributed to constant hacking over several weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

## [[lizard_squad_hacking_incident|Lizard Squad]]'s Activities
[[lizard_squad_hacking_incident|Lizard Squad]] claimed responsibility for the "pointless hacks" on PSN and Xbox Live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The group is humorously characterized as "probably just a group of acne-ridden 17-year-olds with too much Doritos and Mountain Dew to spare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

[[lizard_squad_hacking_incident|Lizard Squad]] consistently tweeted threats to Sony and Microsoft, promising to take down PSN and Xbox Live, and often succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. The gaming networks were criticized for their inability to defend against these attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. It was suggested that [[lizard_squad_hacking_incident|Lizard Squad]] didn't have a specific reason for the hacks, possibly acting out of boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

## Finest Squad's Intervention
A different group of hackers, known as the Finest Squad, claimed to have taken down [[lizard_squad_hacking_incident|Lizard Squad]] approximately a week prior to the Christmas attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## Post-Claim Confusion
Despite Finest Squad's claim, [[lizard_squad_hacking_incident|Lizard Squad]] reportedly took down PSN and Xbox Live again on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This created confusion regarding the effectiveness of Finest Squad's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Impact on Gamers
The outages severely impacted gamers, particularly during the holiday season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. An illustrative scenario describes a child receiving a new PS4 Destiny bundle for Christmas only to find PlayStation Network unavailable, leading to significant frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

### Key Spell Cards

*   **Black Garden** (x1)
    *   A "trolly" field card that halves the attack of normal or special summoned monsters and allows the opposing player to special summon a Level 2, 800 ATK/DEF token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, potentially building up a token army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

*   **Swords of Revealing Light** (x2)
    *   Used for stalling time, fitting the deck's lockdown/troll strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Preferred over Gravity Bind due to the prevalence of Xyz monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Burden of the Mighty** (x1)
    *   A "trolling" card that causes each face-up monster your opponent controls to lose 100 ATK for each of its own levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon** (x1)

    *   Banish Level 5 or higher effect monsters when they are special summoned, serving as a backup for Bottomless Trap Hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

    *   A "trolly" and essential card that negates the summoning of any monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Nightmare Wheel** (x2)
    *   Traps an opponent's monster, preventing it from attacking, and inflicts 500 damage to the opponent during each of your standby phases, contributing to the "burn" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Coï¬ƒn Seller** (x1)
    *   Inflicts 300 damage to the opponent each time a monster card is sent to their graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, adding burn power.
*   **Mirror Force** (x1)
    *   A classic defensive trap card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Scrap-Iron Scarecrow** (x1)
    *   A "trolly" card that can be reset face-down after use instead of being sent to the graveyard, providing continuous defensive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Magic Cylinder** (x1)

### Key Extra Deck Monsters

The Extra Deck primarily consists of Rank 4 Xyz monsters, with two being essential.

*   **Lavalval Chain** (x1)
    *   Essential for getting Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo to the top of the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Also good for milling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Number 101: Silent Honor ARK** (x1)
    *   Considered to have a "broken effect" and is a great defensive Rank 4 Xyz to run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Number 50: Blackship of Corn** (x1)
    *   Its effect deals 1000 damage if the opponent has a monster with less attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Number 55: Go-Go-Go Goliath** (x1)
    *   A temporary Rank 4 Xyz card with a good effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

    *   An essential Rank 4 Xyz card for any deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Stardust Dragon** (x1)
    *   Included solely to enable the summon of Malefic Stardust Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. It's unlikely to be summoned directly due to lack of tuners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The Extra Deck is flexible, but having a selection of Rank 4 Xyz cards is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon is a potential addition once reprinted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

This anti-meta deck is described as highly competitive despite its budget cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Gameplay footage is available to demonstrate its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

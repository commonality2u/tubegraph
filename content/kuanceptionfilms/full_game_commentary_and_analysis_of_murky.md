## Player Overview

At the time of this [[gamers_reactions_and_commentary | commentary]], they had played 39 games with Murky, achieving a record of 26 wins and 13 losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. They were around Level 8 with the hero and had reached Masters league with Murky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Murky Playstyle and Strategy

The player's Murky playstyle is described as "a little bit objective but mostly pushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. A primary goal for every game is to achieve at least 100,000 siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Build Choices

The core of the player's strategy revolves around the [[bubble_build_technique_for_murky | "bubble build"]], also known as "bubble old Murky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Key talent choices include:

*   **Bubble Breeze (Level 1)**: Chosen for the [[bubble_build_technique_for_murky | bubble build]] due to its superiority over Bribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Envenom (Level 4)**: Selected to enable an "assassin" Murky playstyle, allowing for combos with Q, W, and the ultimate ability to quickly eliminate enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **20% Move Speed (Level 7)**: Provides mobility to avoid being caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Compressed Air (Level 7)**: Essential for "maximum siege" damage, enabling the puffer fish to hit multiple towers simultaneously and clear entire base sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Octo-Grab (Level 10)**: The chosen ultimate ability for locking down targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Rejuvenating Bubble (Level 16)**: Chosen for its healing benefits, although "slimey puffer fish" is noted as a strong alternative for increased damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

### Key Tactical Advice

*   **Egg Placement**: Strategic placement of Murky's egg, often in less visible spots, is crucial for quick respawns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Bubble Usage**: Always try to have the bubble ready, especially against heroes with knock-ups or snares, to stay alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The player emphasizes avoiding a "suicidal Murky" playstyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Health Regeneration**: Murky's buffed health regen is highlighted, especially when returning to the "sippy cup" (fountain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Mana-less Abilities**: Murky's ability to spam Q and W without mana cost makes him a "most fun character in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Reaction Time**: Good reaction times are essential for effective bubble usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

### Hero Matchups

Murky is considered very effective against heroes like Kael'thas, Jaina, Kerrigan, Nova, and Illidan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

## Gameplay Highlights and Observations

The game takes place on the **Battlefield of Eternity**, a relatively new map at the time of recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

*   **Early Game**: The player focuses on pushing the bottom lane while the team manages the objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The opponent's lack of experience against Murky is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Siege Focus**: The player consistently aims for siege damage, using puffer fish to clear waves and damage structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Team Dynamics**: The player notes their team is largely composed of "squishies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. While prioritizing pushing, the player occasionally assists with Immortal objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Deaths**: The player experiences a few deaths throughout the game but emphasizes that dying as Murky "doesn't really matter" due to his fast respawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
*   **Late Game Push**: The focus remains on pushing lanes, particularly the bot lane, to secure forts and eventually the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. The team manages to out-level the opponents despite early challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

The game concludes in a victory for the player's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. The player achieves 125,000 siege damage, surpassing their 100,000 goal, even on a two-lane map where Murky's typical push-focused strategy is sometimes less optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. This performance confirms Murky's effectiveness as a "siege king" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

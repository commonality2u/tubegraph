The *Yu-Gi-Oh! Star Pack ARC V* is a set featuring cards from the *Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V* anime series. It is available in packs, with each pack containing only three cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Product Opening
An [[yugioh_pack_opening_experience | opening]] of 24 [[opening_yugioh_card_packs | packs]] of *Star Pack ARC V* was conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The opener initially considered purchasing a [[yugioh_star_pack_2013_booster_box_overview | booster box]] but decided against it due to a perception of "not too many good cards in here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Notable Cards in the Set
The primary target cards from this set include [[notable_cards_in_star_pack_arc_v | Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon]] and [[constellar_pleiades_cards_in_star_pack_arc_v | Constellar Pleiades]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, which is considered one of the best cards in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon is also noted as a desirable card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

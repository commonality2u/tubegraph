The "Infinite Diamond and Gold Glitch" is a [[cloning_glitch_in_minecraft_pe | cloning glitch]] available in *Minecraft Pocket Edition* on iOS that allows players to duplicate items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This exploit can provide unlimited quantities of valuable [[ingame_technology_and_items | items]] such as [[ingame_technology_and_items | diamond]] and [[ingame_technology_and_items | gold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Overview

This glitch is designed to help players acquire resources and can be considered a [[using_glitches_as_a_survival_strategy_in_minecraft_pe | survival strategy]] to overcome resource scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Requirements

To perform the glitch, players need:
*   The [[ingame_technology_and_items | items]] they wish to clone in their inventory ("item pockets") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   An empty chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Method

Follow these steps carefully to clone items:
1.  Place all desired [[ingame_technology_and_items | items]] into an empty chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  Exit the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
3.  Log back into the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
4.  Retrieve all [[ingame_technology_and_items | items]] from the chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
5.  Exit the chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
6.  Walk around for approximately 20 to 30 seconds (or even up to a minute to be safe) without breaking or changing anything in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
7.  Exit the game again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
8.  Close the app completely from the multitasking bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
9.  Re-open the *Minecraft Pocket Edition* app, press "Play," and return to your game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Upon returning to the game, the items will have been cloned, effectively doubling your initial quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Applications

With unlimited [[ingame_technology_and_items | diamond]] or [[ingame_technology_and_items | gold]], players can achieve various objectives:
*   Acquire any desired [[ingame_technology_and_items | item]] in large quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   If both [[ingame_technology_and_items | gold]] and [[ingame_technology_and_items | diamond]] are cloned, these resources can be used to construct a [[ingame_technology_and_items | nether reactor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

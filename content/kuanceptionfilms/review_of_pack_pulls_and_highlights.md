This article provides a review of a [[Yugioh card pack reviews | Yu-Gi-Oh!]] Star Pack Arc-V unboxing, focusing on the cards pulled and the reactions during the opening.

## Unboxing Details
The video features the unboxing of 24 packs of Star Pack Arc-V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Each pack contains three cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The opener opted for individual packs rather than a [[booster_pack_and_promo_cards | booster box]], reasoning that there aren't many "good cards" in the set, and the primary goal was to aim for specific rare pulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Target Cards
The main [[rare_and_super_rare_card_pulls | rare cards]] the opener hoped to pull were the Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon and Constellar Pleiades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Key Pulls and [[Reactions to unexpected and rare card pulls | Reactions]]

Throughout the unboxing, the presenter sorts [[card_packs_and_foil_cards | star foils]] into one pile and commons into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

*   **Constellar Pleiades**
    *   The first notable [[Yugioh card pulls and reactions | pull]] was a Constellar Pleiades, which the presenter immediately set aside, deeming it "very good" and "one of the best cards in the set" alongside the Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   A second Constellar Pleiades was pulled later, which was also noted as "very good to get this to the side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon**
    *   An Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon was pulled, described as "always good to get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Mobius the Mega Monarch**
    *   A Mobius the Mega Monarch was pulled and set aside, described as "pretty cool to get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The presenter later pulled what they initially thought was another Mobius the Frost Monarch, but corrected themselves, confirming it was the first copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Polymerization**
    *   Polymerization cards were noted multiple times as "nice" and "always good to get a polymerization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Hunt for Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
Despite the multiple packs opened, the highly sought-after Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon was not pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The presenter expressed anticipation for it multiple times throughout the opening, stating, "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon, here we come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> and asking for "Kaiba" to give it to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Summary of Highlights
The main highlights from the 24 Star Pack Arc-V packs were:
*   Two Constellar Pleiades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>
*   One Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
*   One Mobius the Mega Monarch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>

The presenter was "pretty happy" with the two Constellar Pleiades, noting they are "pretty hard to pull nowadays" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Although the overall [[discussion_of_lucky_pulls_and_repeats | luck]] was not considered "that lucky" as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, the pulls provided some valuable cards.

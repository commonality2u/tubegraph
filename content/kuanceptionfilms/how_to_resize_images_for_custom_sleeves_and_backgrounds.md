When adding [[tutorial_on_adding_custom_sleeves_in_ygo_devpro | custom sleeves]] or [[installing_custom_backgrounds_in_ygo_devpro | custom backgrounds]] in YGO DevPro, it's important to have a correctly sized image to prevent it from looking distorted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. YGO DevPro simplifies this process by offering an automatic resizing feature.

## Automatic Image Resizing Process

YGO DevPro will prompt you to resize an image to the correct dimensions if it's not already the right size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This applies to both custom sleeves and backgrounds.

### For Custom Sleeves

1.  From the YGO DevPro game list, navigate to the "Customize" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
2.  Click on "Content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
3.  To add a custom sleeve, go to "Player One Covers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
4.  Click the "ADD" button and locate the image you wish to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
5.  When prompted to resize the image to the correct size, select "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### For Custom Backgrounds (Main Menu)

1.  In the "Customize" tab, select "Backgrounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  Click "ADD" and choose your desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
3.  The program will offer to resize the image to the correct dimensions; confirm by selecting "yes" when the prompt appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### For In-Game Backgrounds

1.  Within the "Customize" tab, click on "Game Backgrounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
2.  Follow the same steps as adding main menu backgrounds: "ADD" your image and confirm the resizing prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Once the image is resized and installed, you can [[previewing_and_formatting_custom_sleeves_and_backgrounds | preview]] it to ensure it appears as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The **Synchron Extreme Structure Deck** was recently opened and reviewed, having been released a couple of weeks prior to the video's recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The video provides an [[yugioh_synchron_extreme_japanese_structure_deck_overview | overview]] of the deck's contents, key cards, and notable reprints.

## General Impressions
Konami is noted for doing a "great job" with [[yugioh_structure_decks_and_starter_decks_comparison | structure decks]] currently, while [[yugioh_structure_decks_and_starter_decks_comparison | starter decks]] are considered "pretty lame," despite including essential cards like Mirror Force and Bottomless Trap Hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

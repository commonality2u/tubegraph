The Gravekeeper Structure Deck is a Yu-Gi-Oh! product obtained as part of a "value cube" from Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While the packaging misleadingly suggests it contains 25 cards, 2 boosters, and 5 foil cards, the deck actually consists of 40 cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

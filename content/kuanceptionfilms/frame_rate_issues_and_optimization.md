The [[black_ops_3_beta_pc_performance | Black Ops 3 beta]] on PC experienced significant [[performance_issues_in_gaming | performance issues]] and [[game_optimization_issues_on_different_platforms | optimization challenges]] at its release. The game was noted for running "terribly" on PC, even with a graphics card like the 750 Ti, which was not considered outdated at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## PC Performance Overview

While frame rate was sometimes consistent when recording gameplay with Fraps, there were frequent "huge drops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The overall sentiment was that the game did not feel "very optimized" for PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Players experienced "game breaking lag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, making the PC experience "not ideal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a> and "painful to watch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. It was suggested that PC players without a "killer machine" would experience lag and complain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

> "The game just doesn't feel very optimized. That's the best word right now, optimized for PC." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

## Comparison to Console Performance

In contrast to the PC beta, the PlayStation 4 beta of Black Ops 3 was described as "amazing," with a smooth gameplay experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This stark [[pc_versus_console_gameplay_performance | difference in performance]] highlighted the specific [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | optimization challenges for Black Ops 3 on PC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Historical Context of Call of Duty on PC

A common disappointment among PC gamers was the lack of optimization in recent Call of Duty titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While Call of Duty used to be PC-exclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, later titles like *Modern Warfare 3* and *Black Ops 2* were considered "all right" in terms of PC optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, *Black Ops 1* and *Ghosts* were cited as having "complete [h__h]" optimization on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The [[black_ops_3_beta_pc_performance | Black Ops 3 beta]] continued this trend, not "looking ideal" or "very good" on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Other Related Issues

Beyond frame rate, other issues impacting the PC beta experience included:
*   **Game not launching:** A friend downloaded the beta but the game would not open for him, nor would it connect to servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Player skill:** The player admitted to not being very good at the PC version of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, partly due to being a console Call of Duty player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Gameplay mechanics:** The game featured numerous ways to die via falling off cliffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Positive aspects:** Despite the technical difficulties, the game received praise for its "amazing audio quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Hopes for Full Release

There was a strong hope that the [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | optimization challenges for Black Ops 3 on PC]] would be exclusive to the beta and that the full game release would be "polished nicely" for an enjoyable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. There was an appeal to Treyarch to "optimize the game for PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The objective of opening 24 packs of Star Pack Arc-V was primarily to obtain the [[dark_rebellion_xyz_dragon | Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon]] card, as there were not many other "good cards" in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. A secondary target was Constellar Pleiades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Opening Strategy
The opening consisted of 24 packs, with each pack containing three cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The aim was to be "very lucky" to pull the desired cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Hunt
Throughout the opening, the primary focus remained on acquiring [[dark_rebellion_xyz_dragon | Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The video narrator repeatedly expressed anticipation and desire for the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, directly appealing to "Kaiba" for its appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Even in the final pack, hope for [[dark_rebellion_xyz_dragon | Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon]] persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

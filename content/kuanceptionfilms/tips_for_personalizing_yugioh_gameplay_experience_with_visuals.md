3.  **Add Image:** Click "ADD" and browse to the picture you wish to use as your sleeves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
4.  **Resize Prompt:** If prompted to resize the image to the correct size, press "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
5.  **Install:** Once the image is added, right-click on your newly added sleeve and select "install" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A "success" prompt should appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Adding Custom Backgrounds

DevPro allows you to customize both the main menu wallpaper and the in-game duel background.

### Customizing Main Menu Wallpapers

1.  **Navigate to Backgrounds:** From the "content" section, select "backgrounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  **Add Image:** Click "ADD" and select your chosen wallpaper image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
3.  **Resize & Install:** The system will resize the image to the correct dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Confirm with "yes" if prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, then right-click and "install" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
4.  **Preview:** Use the "preview" option to view your new main menu background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Customizing In-Game Duel Backgrounds

Changing the main menu wallpaper does not automatically change the background within a duel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

1.  **Navigate to Game Backgrounds:** From the main customization menu, select "game backgrounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
2.  **Add & Install Image:** Click "ADD" to select your desired in-game wallpaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Once added, right-click on the image and press "install" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  **Preview:** Use the "preview" option to confirm the in-game background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. An example includes changing to an Aquaman-themed wallpaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

After following these steps, both your custom sleeves and in-game wallpaper will be correctly formatted and displayed during a duel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

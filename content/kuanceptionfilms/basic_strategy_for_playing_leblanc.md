This guide outlines a basic strategy for playing LeBlanc in League of Legends.

## Early Game: Itemization and Lane Setup

To begin, purchase a Hextech Revolver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. In the lane, position yourself next to the opposing team's buff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. You may be able to trick opponents into placing a ward at their Krugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. For initiating plays, conceal yourself in the top bush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Gameplay Mechanics

At level one, LeBlanc can significantly reduce an enemy's health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. LeBlanc is noted as being "OP" (overpowered) and difficult to trade with at level one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Upon reaching level three, you can engage your enemy fully to secure a kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Resource Management

*   Initially, missing minions can provide motivation to farm kills later in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Quickly steal your jungler's blue buff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Positioning

Always utilize your W ability to return to your distortion pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Item Progression

On your first return to base, aim to purchase the Spooky Mask and Star Rod Wand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These items are said to grant true damage that scales with the amount of gold you currently possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Mid-Game Objectives

*   When the enemy team attempts to secure a dragon, ensure you steal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   You can quickly destroy the mid turret with LeBlanc's powerful auto attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Dealing with Specific Champions

When facing [[strategies_for_playing_ekko | Ekko]], note that his Q ability does minimal damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The opponent's [[strategies_for_playing_ekko | Ekko]] is described as unable to trade effectively at level one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## General Tips

*   Ignore ganks from junglers, as they may try to steal your kills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   If you die in lane, attribute it to minions rather than the enemy champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. You are never the source of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Ensure that your teammate, possibly a [[tahm_kench_strategy | Tahm Kench]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, secures every super minion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

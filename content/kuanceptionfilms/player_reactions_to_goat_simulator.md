## Initial Impressions and Confusion

Upon starting the [[goat_simulator_gameplay|gameplay]], the player quickly expressed confusion regarding the goat's physics, asking, "Why am I floating? What's going on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Despite the unusual physics, the player noted, "Yes, the music is making this really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, highlighting an appreciation for the game's atmosphere.

## Challenges and Frustrations

The player encountered moments of frustration, particularly when navigating the environment, exclaiming, "Oh my god why okay, I almost fell off I'm gonna fall off oh my god" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Difficulty with character control was evident when attempting to turn the goat, leading to the question, "Why isn't he turning around? I'm licking his freaking oh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Moments of Achievement and Discovery

Despite the challenges, the player celebrated small successes, such as navigating an obstacle successfully, declaring, "Yes I did it!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> and "Yes, hey beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. New game mechanics, like a slow-motion effect, prompted curiosity: "Why is it slow now, what did I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Unexpected Events and Humor

The [[funny_moments_in_gaming|gameplay]] was punctuated by unexpected and humorous events. The player attempted to "make friends" with an NPC, saying, "Oh it's a man, come here let me be your friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Surprising incidents, such as witnessing an NPC on fire, elicited exclamations like, "Oh that man is on fire!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> and "Oh Jesus, oh I said, oh Lord Jesus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The player's determination was highlighted when repeatedly targeting an NPC, stating, "Oh, there's that man again. I'm gonna get him this time, just watch me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The player's [[funny_moments_in_goat_simulator|reactions]] also included apologies for accidental [[destruction_physics_in_goat_simulator|gameplay]] actions, such as "Oh sorry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> and "Oh, whoops, oh oh, I didn't mean to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Observational humor was noted when encountering a uniquely shaped object, remarking, "Oh no penis-shaped food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The player also questioned the behavior of NPCs, asking, "Why is he not... why is he not coming, come on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The session concluded with a comical observation: "No, there's grass in his butt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

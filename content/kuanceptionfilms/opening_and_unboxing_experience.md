An [[YuGiOh Pack Opening Experience | unboxing and pack opening experience]] features 24 packs of Yu-Gi-Oh! Star Pack Arc-V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The primary goal of this [[unboxing_experience_and_challenges | unboxing experience]] is to pull specific rare cards, namely Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon and Constellar Pleiades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Pack Contents and Procedure

Each pack contains three cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. As cards are opened, star foils are separated into one pile, and common cards into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Notable Card Pulls

Throughout the [[unboxing_procedure_and_card_arrangement | opening procedure]], several cards of interest were pulled:

*   **Constellar Pleiades** Two copies of this card were pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It is considered one of the best cards in the set, alongside Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The host expressed satisfaction with these pulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon** One copy of this card was obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Mobius the Mega Monarch** Two copies of this card were pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Timegazer Magician** Multiple copies were pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Stargazer Magician** Pulled multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Polymerization** Two copies were pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Raid Raptor** Several Raid Raptor cards were obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **The Phantom Knights of Shadow Veil** One copy was pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Despite pulling desirable cards like Constellar Pleiades, the highly sought-after Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon was not obtained from any of the packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. While happy with the Constellar Pleiades, the host notes that they are not considered particularly lucky pulls from Star Packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

The PC beta for *Black Ops 3* presented significant [[challenges_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | challenges]] for players, particularly concerning [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | performance and optimization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. While the game was considered fun on consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>, the PC experience in its beta phase was notably problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>.

## Performance Issues

Players encountered several [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | performance issues]] during the *Black Ops 3* PC beta:
*   **Poor Optimization** The game was described as "not very good" and "running terribly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, lacking proper [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | optimization]] for PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. This was particularly disappointing given that *Call of Duty* titles were historically exclusive to PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Frame Rates** Although frame rates were consistent when recording with Fraps, there were frequent "huge drops" at other times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This contributed to a general feeling that the game was unoptimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.
*   **Hardware Compatibility** Even with a decent graphics card like the 750 Ti, the game performed poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It was suggested that only players with "killer machines" might avoid lag and complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:17">[05:16:17]</a>.
*   **Game-Breaking Lag** Players experienced significant and disruptive lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, which made the game painful to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Console Performance

The PC beta's performance sharply contrasted with the PlayStation 4 beta, which was described as "amazing" and fun to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This highlighted the specific [[pc_versus_console_gameplay_performance | optimization issues]] present on the PC platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

## Other Gameplay Challenges and Bugs

Beyond optimization, the beta also presented other issues:
*   **Player Difficulty** The speaker admitted to not being very good at the game, partially due to being a console Call of Duty player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Environmental Hazards** There were numerous instances of dying from falling off cliffs and other "mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Client Launch Issues** One significant bug prevented a friend from even launching the game or connecting to servers, despite having downloaded the beta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. This was seen as a fundamental problem that "shouldn't be happening ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Positive Aspects

Despite the [[pros_and_cons_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | challenges]], one notable positive was the game's audio quality, which received high praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## Hopes for the Full Release

There was strong hope that the [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | performance issues]] would be resolved by the game's full release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. The speaker urged Treyarch to optimize the game for PC, emphasizing their love for the *Call of Duty* and *Black Ops* franchises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. The expectation was for the game to be polished for a smooth PC experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

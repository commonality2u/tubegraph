[[collectibility_and_value_of_yugioh_cards | Finding valuable YuGiOh cards]] can be a challenging endeavor, often requiring luck and persistence. One collector describes discovering a rare full deck box at a Walmart, noting it was the last one on the shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The box, containing a Warlock Burst Set deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, was described as extremely rare, claimed to be 200 years old, and bearing stains that add to its character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Unboxing and Initial Discoveries

Upon opening the rare box, the contents initially appeared to be mundane, resembling painted rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, after letting the box [[fermenting_yugioh_decks_for_rarity | ferment]] for about two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, it supposedly spawned League of Legends RP codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Beneath these codes, the collector found [[collecting_ultra_rare_yugioh_cards | ultra rare Yu-Gi-Oh cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Notable cards pulled from this initial opening included:
*   An "ultra ultra rare" Charizard card, described as impossible to find in stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Another Charizard card, which was "very shiny" and in mint condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   A "Dark Dugtrio," which was dismissed as "a piece of crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   A yellow Raichu card, which was also a double card, and surprisingly legendary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This specific card was described as Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, suggesting the potential for [[buying_and_importing_japanese_yugioh_decks | Japanese imports]] in [[chasing_rare_yugioh_cards | chasing rare cards]].
*   Multiple "Level X" and other legendary cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Continued Fermentation and Disappointment

Despite initial success, the collector continued the [[fermenting_yugioh_decks_for_rarity | fermentation]] process for another two weeks with the hope of generating more valuable cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. However, this second attempt yielded only a "starter pack" featuring tempera paint in various colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This was a significant disappointment, as the goal was to find "more legendaries" and cards with "way more value" for selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The collector intended to sell the cards for "as much money as I can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, indicating a focus on [[yugioh_card_market_value | market value]] rather than gameplay.

A third round of [[fermenting_yugioh_decks_for_rarity | fermentation]] produced a "panda bundle" containing three rare panda figurines, including an "ultra rare" broken one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. These figurines, though collected by the presenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, were deemed to have very little [[value_and_rarity_of_yugioh_cards | monetary value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

Ultimately, the extended [[fermenting_yugioh_decks_for_rarity | fermentation]] process failed to yield any more valuable YuGiOh cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The final outcome was a set of cards described as "pieces of crap" that were "completely worthless," with no playability or stacking ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This highlights the unpredictable nature and potential for disappointment when trying to find or generate rare cards.

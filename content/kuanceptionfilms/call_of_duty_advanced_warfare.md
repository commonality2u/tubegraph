While the speaker was "not actually too excited for" [[Call of Duty Advanced Warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, they intended to purchase it upon release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This purchasing decision was due to a personal tradition of buying all Call of Duty titles released since [[call_of_duty_4_remastered_for_ps4_and_xbox_one | Call of Duty 4]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

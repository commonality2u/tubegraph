This article details the [[unboxing_experience_and_challenges | unboxing]] of a Yu-Gi-Oh! 2012 Premium Collection Tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This particular tin is considered rare in 2015, as it was released more than three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Each tin contains 14 foil cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The [[opening_and_unboxing_experience | Unboxing Experience]]

The tin was opened using an [[unboxing_knife | unboxing knife]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The sound of the unwrapping was described as "seductive" and "very satisfying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The following cards were revealed from the tin:

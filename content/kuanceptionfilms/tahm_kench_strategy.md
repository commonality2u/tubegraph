## Abilities

### Passive

### Ultimate Ability (Unconfirmed Name)
When activating his ultimate ability, [[tahm_kench_abilities | Tahm Kench]] targets a location that can be quite far away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He opens his mouth to begin channeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

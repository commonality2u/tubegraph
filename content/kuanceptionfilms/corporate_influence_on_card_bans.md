Yu-Gi-Oh!'s Forbidden/Unlimited list, effective July 16, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, has been a subject of scrutiny regarding corporate influence on card bans. Players have expressed frustration with Konami's decisions, often linking them to financial motives rather than pure game balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Controversial Bans and Perceived Motives

### Gin Releaser of Rituals
The ban of Gin Releaser of Rituals was seen as an indirect "nerf" to the Nekroz archetype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Critics argued that Konami should have directly targeted specific Nekroz cards by limiting or banning them, rather than banning Gin Releaser of Rituals, which had supported various ritual decks for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This decision was viewed as "screwing lots of decks" by avoiding a direct hit on Nekroz itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Tellarknight Ptolemaeus (mispronounced as "Volcanic Chain")
The banning of Tellarknight Ptolemaeus, which affected Stellarknights, was believed to be a "preemptive ban" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The theory behind this was that Konami wanted to prevent powerful combos when a new card, "Oden" (likely referring to Kozmo cards or similar upcoming archetypes at the time), was released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This action was explicitly called out as "corporate greed," suggesting Konami's desire to promote new products without older cards interfering with their sales potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The speaker also expressed surprise that the card Construct was not hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Unaddressed Issues and Player Frustration

Players expressed significant disappointment over cards that were not addressed on the list.
*   **Shaddolls**: There was strong sentiment for the unbanning of Shaddoll cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The lack of change for Shaddolls was a major source of frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Qliphorts and Burning Abyss**: Neither Qliphort nor Burning Abyss archetypes were touched by the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **"Lose One Turn"**: There was a desire for the [[notable_cards_and_their_effects | Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | Trap Card]] "Lose One Turn" to be limited, as it was perceived to make the game "cancerous" in competitive play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

The overall sentiment among some players was that Konami's banlist decisions were not always in the best interest of competitive balance or player enjoyment, often leaning towards promoting new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

The rarity of this card caused the opener to express extreme excitement, stating they were "beyond words" and might "hyperventilate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Another Bottomless Trap Hole** In a subsequent pull, a second secret rare "Bottomless Trap Hole" was found, leading to exclamations of disbelief and the sentiment "I'm done" due to the overwhelming luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The opener noted they had not familiarized themselves with "artifact cards" but recognized its prismatic rarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Other Noteworthy Rare and Foil Cards

Beyond secret and prismatic rares, several other valuable or [[promotional_yugioh_cards | promotional Yugioh cards]] were found:

*   **Dark Magician Girl OCG Foil** An OCG (Original Card Game) version of "Dark Magician Girl" in foil was pulled, described as "really really nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The experience of finding these [[finding_ultra_rare_yugioh_cards | ultra rare cards]] led the opener to suggest their packs might have been "rained" (lucky or perhaps pre-sorted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

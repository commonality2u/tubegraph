Gameplay commentary in [[multiplayer_strategies_and_gameplay_techniques_in_black_ops_3 | Call of Duty Black Ops 3]] often features strategies specifically tailored for the Nuketown and Combine maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Overview
The content highlights a compilation of "rushing moments" on both Nuketown and Combine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. These maps are generally preferred when implementing the discussed strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The gameplay primarily takes place within the Chaos Moshpit playlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## General Strategy
The dominant strategy emphasized for Nuketown and Combine is aggressive rushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This involves constantly pushing forward and engaging enemies quickly across the map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Weapon of Choice
The Brecci shotgun is identified as the weapon of choice for these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Brecci Shotgun Effectiveness
The Brecci is described as a semi-automatic shotgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> and is considered potentially the best shotgun in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It is suggested that the weapon might be "OP" (overpowered) and possibly requires a "nerf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A notable characteristic of the Brecci is its accessibility for new players:
> "any new can just pick up this gun and be a douchebag running around do the tanking with this gun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
> "any random noob can pick up this gonna do the tanking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

The effectiveness of the Brecci, particularly for rushing, is enhanced on PC due to higher frames per second (FPS), such as 120 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Player Experience and Lobbies
The lobbies encountered on Nuketown and Combine, especially within Chaos Moshpit, are noted to frequently contain "Christmas noobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This term refers to newer or less experienced players, which further contributes to the effectiveness of aggressive strategies with powerful weapons like the Brecci.

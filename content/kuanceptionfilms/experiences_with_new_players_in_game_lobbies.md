This article discusses the [[gameplay_experience | gameplay experience]] in Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 on PC, particularly focusing on the presence and impact of new players in lobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Game and Context

The [[gameplay_experience | gameplay]] featured in the commentary takes place in Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 on PC, specifically on the maps Nuketown and Combine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The game mode was likely Chaos Mosh Pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The player highlights using the Brecci shotgun, compiling "dank" rushing moments and streaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Impact of New Players on Gameplay

### The Brecci Shotgun's Role
The Brecci shotgun is described as "probably the best shotgun on the game" and "very OP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is a semi-automatic weapon that "probably needs a nerf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The commentator notes that "any noob can just pick up this gun and be a douchebag running around doing the tanking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This ease of use makes it highly effective, especially on PC where higher frames per second (FPS) can benefit rushing [[multiplayer_strategies | strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Player Performance
Despite the commentator not considering themselves "very good at this game," they still manage to perform well with the Brecci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This observation reinforces the idea that "any random noob can pick up this gun and do the tanking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Identifying New Players

The lobbies featured during the [[gameplay_experience | gameplay]] prominently included "Christmas noobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The presence of these new players contributes to the overall [[gameplay_experience | gameplay]], allowing players to achieve "dank streaks" and "have a blast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

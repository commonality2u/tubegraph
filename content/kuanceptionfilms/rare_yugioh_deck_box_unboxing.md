Seth from Conception Films conducts an unboxing of a rare YuGiOh full deck box, which he discovered as the last one on a shelf at Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The box is said to contain a "Warlock Burst" set deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Crate's Appearance
The box, referred to as "the crate," initially resembles an egg carton holding 18 eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, it is actually a YuGiOh deck container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It features stains that contribute to its "character," demonstrating its supposed rarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. According to Seth, the box is "200 years old" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## First Opening: League of Legends RP and "Ultra Rare" Cards
Upon its first opening, the box appears to be filled with rocks that Seth had painted when he was eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. After letting the box "ferment for about two weeks," it "spawned" League of Legends RP (Riot Points) codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Beneath the codes, the box contained "ultra rare" YuGiOh cards, described as a "full deck of six" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The cards revealed included:
*   An "ultra ultra rare" Charizard YuGiOh card, described as "very rare" and unobtainable in stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Another Charizard, noted for being very shiny and in "mint condition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   A "Dark Dugtrio," which was dismissed as a "piece of crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   A yellow, Raichu-like card that appeared to be Japanese and was a "double card" (one card with two sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Another "level X" card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Another "two-face card," which was deemed to "suck complete crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Second Opening: The Starter Booster Pack
After being left to "ferment for about another two weeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, the box produced a "UVO starter booster pack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This pack supposedly featured tempera paint (not tempura) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> in five colors: green, blue, red, white, and yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Seth expressed disappointment with this outcome, as he was hoping for more "legendaries" and "more value" to sell the cards, since he doesn't play YuGiOh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. He plans to sell the cards for as much money as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Third Opening: The Panda Bundle
After another "couple weeks" of fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, the box yielded "the panda bundle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This bundle included three rare panda figurines, which Seth collects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

The figurines found were:
*   A "traditional bumblebee panda" with two black stripes, black ears, and circles around its eyes like a raccoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   An "ultra rare" panda figurine, which was broken inside but still considered very exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Seth estimated it could be sold for "two cents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   A small but "mighty powerful" panda that clears the entire YuGiOh battle arena of cards, figurines, wax figures, and bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This panda's effect supposedly combines with a "blue 10 or 25 League of Legends RP card" to win the game when placed on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Final Outcome: Worthless Draws
After leaving the box to ferment for an "exonerable amount of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, the final outcome was deemed a complete failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The cards obtained were described as "worthless pieces of crap" that cannot be played on the field or stacked with other cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, and would even give an opponent twenty dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Seth expressed frustration with the increasingly "crappier" draws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

The Call of Duty franchise, which originated on PC around 2003, has seen shifts in its player base, particularly impacting the PC platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. While the newest titles, such as Black Ops 3, are available on PC, there are significant considerations for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

## Small PC Player Base
One of the primary negative aspects of playing Black Ops 3 on PC is the size of its player base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>. The PC Call of Duty player base is considerably smaller compared to its console counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:03">[01:54:03]</a>.

### Limited Game Modes
The small player count directly leads to in-game playlist issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:03">[01:56:03]</a>. It is often difficult to find enough players to start matches in various game modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:03">[01:58:03]</a>. Players can generally only find matches in Team Deathmatch and Chaos Mosh Pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:03">[02:02:03]</a>. On a good day, it might be possible to find a rare Free-For-All or Gun Game lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:03">[02:07:03]</a>.

### Activision's Marketing Strategy
Activision has primarily focused its marketing efforts on a younger audience, which has resulted in a predominantly console-based community for Call of Duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This focus has led to Activision seemingly neglecting its PC consumer base, which can be irritating for PC players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Console vs. PC Player Base
> While consoles like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One rarely experience optimization issues that prevent games from loading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, the PC version faces challenges like smaller player bases and [[performance_and_optimization_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | optimization issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. The game was undeniably developed primarily for consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, which impacts the overall [[call_of_duty_console_vs_pc_gameplay | Call of Duty console vs PC gameplay]] experience.

## Nature of the PC Player Base
Despite the smaller size, the PC Black Ops 3 community tends to be more competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Players generally have at least some FPS gaming experience, meaning "pub stomping" (dominating public matches) is less common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This environment can be appealing for those who enjoy competitive gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. Additionally, there are fewer "small obnoxious children" on PC Black Ops 3 compared to consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### Communication
In-game text chat is a convenient feature unique to PC Black Ops 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Players often use text chat to communicate because their keyboards are readily available, rather than relying solely on voice chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

## Customizable Elements

Players can encounter skins that drastically alter the game's visual presentation:
*   **Icons and Circles**
    *   Skins can feature non-traditional icons, such as "weed" themed icons for all game elements, including hit circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
    *   A specific "Twitch Chat" skin incorporates Pepe (a popular internet meme character) for every circle, often with a "c" in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Skip Buttons**
    *   The skip button animation can be customized, with one example showing the "dancing kid" gif <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Spinners**
    *   The visual appearance of [[gameplay_terminology_and_mechanics_in_osu | spinners]] is also determined by the active skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Skin Themes

Skins can be themed around various concepts, such as "Twitch Chat," which incorporates popular internet memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Some skins are described as "dank" due to their unusual or humorous thematic elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Players often share skins with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

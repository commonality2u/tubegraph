[[paradigm_game_overview | Paradigm]] is introduced as a point-and-click [[adventure_and_puzzle_elements_in_paradigm | adventure game]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The game appears to be in an alpha demo state, with some areas still under development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

## Core Gameplay Interactions

The primary [[game_mechanics_and_controls | controls]] involve interacting with objects and the environment via mouse clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Players use a cursor to click on items and characters within the game world.

*   **Right-Click Functionality**
    Right-clicking an object allows the player to access more information about it, such as in the case of the "John computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. An in-game prompt suggests that hitting "I" on most English keyboards can also access the inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Item Usage and Puzzles

A significant part of the [[gameplay_experience | gameplay]] involves picking up and utilizing items to solve environmental puzzles.

*   **Picking Up Items**
    The player can pick up various objects, such as a log <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> or a record from a collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Combining and Using Items**
    The game features [[gameplay_mechanics_and_item_usage | item usage]] and combination mechanics, though not all combinations are functional, as seen when attempting to combine socks and "Finney pics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. A key puzzle involves finding an "operating system" or "lines every flaw piggies" to fix a non-working computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. The player also needs to "plug in" objects, such as the computer "John" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Map Navigation**
    A map is a crucial item for navigation and progression. The player can access a "postcard map" using the mouse button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. This map is used to find locations or individuals, like a "basic idiot" who is described as being in the "bottom writing good forest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. A specific task involves delivering mail or the map to this character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

## Game Progression

The game progresses through solving puzzles, interacting with characters, and navigating different areas. Exit points allow players to move between locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>, leading to "convenient plot development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Completing objectives, such as fixing the computer and delivering the map, moves the player towards the end of the alpha demo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.

Upon completing the demo, the game prompts the player to check out its [[kickstarter_campaign_for_paradigm | Kickstarter]] campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

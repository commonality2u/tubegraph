### Notable Card Pulls

During the opening of a 2015 megatin (possibly the Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon megatin mentioned earlier), a Dante card was pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This pull was particularly lucky, as it was the first 2015 megatin opened by the presenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

A second Dante card was also pulled from a 2015 Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon megatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This second [[rare_yugioh_card_pulls | rare pull]] occurred consecutively from separate 2015 tins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, leading to disbelief and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The pulls were unexpected as the mega packs inside the megatins are not scannable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

> [!tip] Desired Pulls
> Prior to opening, hopes for specific [[rare_yugioh_card_pulls | rare card pulls]] included another Dante, Stellar Knight Exies, Rank 4s, or promotional cards like Satellarknight Constellar Diamond, El Shaddoll Winda, or Clear Wing Synchro Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, cards like Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer and preparations for Nekroz of Unicore were undesirable pulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Tools and Techniques

Packs were opened using a "dinosaur family club pencil sharpener elite edition," described as "dank opening skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Despite the unusual tool, packs were sometimes ripped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

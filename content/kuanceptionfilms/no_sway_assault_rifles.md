In [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Call of Duty Advanced Warfare]], a notable feature is that assault rifles exhibit no sway when aiming down sights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. Unlike previous *Call of Duty* titles where assault rifles had a small amount of sway, in this game, they have none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:40">[01:36:40]</a>.

The IMR, an assault rifle, demonstrates this characteristic as it remains perfectly steady when aimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This lack of sway is considered by some to be "overpowered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, although many players may not notice a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Another example, the Bal, also shows no sway even when equipped with a hybrid site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Sniper Rifles
While assault rifles have no sway, sniper rifles in [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Call of Duty Advanced Warfare]] exhibit extreme amounts of sway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This places snipers at a disadvantage, which was a requested change by many players who had asked for [[sniping_in_mw3 | sniper Nerfs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. As a result, quickscoping in the game has become considerably more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

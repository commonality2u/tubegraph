When beginning to [[how_to_play_osu | play Osu]], some players are encouraged to immediately tackle challenging maps rather than starting with easier ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Equipment
To begin, you will need a tablet and a keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is advised to avoid using a mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Map Selection
The recommendation is to go "straight into the hard maps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Specifically, players are told to go "directly to the big black" map, as beating it is considered impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Achieving Success
To successfully complete these difficult maps, players are advised to secretly enable [[using_auto_mode_in_osu | auto mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. By doing this, one can impress others with their Osu skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> and [[achieving_a_perfect_combo_in_osu | beat the song with a perfect combo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

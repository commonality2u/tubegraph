Murky is a unique and effective hero in Heroes of the Storm, especially when focused on pushing lanes and maximizing siege damage. This guide compiles strategies and tips for playing Murky effectively, with a particular emphasis on maximizing his impact through structure destruction.

## Murky's Playstyle and Objectives

Murky's playstyle is generally focused on pushing lanes, though it can also incorporate objective play [00:02:08]. A key goal for a Murky player is to achieve at least 100,000 siege damage in every game [00:02:29]. While this might be a challenge on maps with only two lanes like Battlefield of Eternity, it is achievable [00:28:35].

### Preferred Builds
The recommended build for Murky is the [[bubble_build_technique_for_murky | bubble build]], also referred to as "bubble bubble old Murky" [00:02:13]. This build heavily relies on using the safety and utility of Murky's bubble ability.

Specific talent choices for the bubble build include:
*   **Level 1:** [[bubble_build_technique_for_murky | Bubble Breeze]] [00:02:54]. Initially, "bribe" might seem appealing, but [[bubble_build_technique_for_murky | Bubble Breeze]] is considered superior for this build [00:03:07].
*   **Level 4:** The "sippy cup" for additional health regeneration [00:04:40].
*   **Level 7:** Envenom, for assassin potential [00:05:43]. This allows Murky to eliminate targets that attempt to stop his push [00:05:49].
*   **Level 10 (Heroic):** [[Gameplay strategies for playing as Murky in Heroes of the Storm | Octo-Grab]] [00:10:32].
*   **Level 13:** Compressed Air [00:07:43]. This talent is crucial for maximizing siege damage by allowing the pufferfish to hit multiple structures at once [00:07:51].
*   **Level 16:** Rejuvenating Bubble [00:15:08]. This provides significant healing while in bubble form [00:19:19]. Alternatively, "Slimey Pufferfish" (pufferfish casts slime) can be taken for increased damage, especially against minion waves [00:15:10].

### Maximizing Siege Damage
*   **Prioritize Pushing:** Murky excels at destroying structures. His abilities, especially the pufferfish, are highly effective against towers and forts [00:07:55].
*   **Leverage Compressed Air:** The Compressed Air talent (Level 13) is vital as it allows Murky's pufferfish to cover a wider area, hitting multiple towers or even an entire base section with one cast [00:07:51].
*   **Coordinate with Immortals:** On maps like Battlefield of Eternity, Murky can push a lane while the team focuses on the Immortal objective, or contribute to Immortal damage if nearby [00:04:47]. After an Immortal is secured, Murky can quickly move to a lane to leverage the Immortal's push [00:17:17].

## General Gameplay Strategy
*   **Egg Placement:** Always place your egg in a discreet location, such as behind structures where it's not easily visible to enemies [00:03:14]. If your egg is destroyed, immediately reposition it [00:12:55].
*   **Survival Over Suicide:** While Murky has a fast respawn, it's generally better to stay alive. Prioritize escaping rather than engaging in suicidal plays [00:04:05]. Use your bubble to disengage when snared or targeted by crowd control [00:04:20].
*   **Bubble Management:** Almost always have your bubble ability available. It's Murky's primary survival tool against knock-ups, snares, and other crowd control [00:04:17]. Proper use of the bubble requires good reaction times and knowledge of enemy abilities [00:27:04].
*   **Ability Spam:** Murky does not use mana, allowing for constant use of abilities like his slime (Q) and pufferfish (W) [00:09:51].
*   **Assassination Potential:** With talents like Envenom and [[Gameplay strategies for playing as Murky in Heroes of the Storm | Octo-Grab]], Murky can combo abilities to eliminate single targets, particularly squishy heroes [00:05:49]. A common combo is Q, W, and the [[Gameplay strategies for playing as Murky in Heroes of the Storm | Octo-Grab]] heroic [00:06:02]. This burst damage can surprise opponents [00:19:19].
*   **Targeting Weaknesses:** Murky can be effective against heroes like Kael'thas, Jaina, Kerrigan, Nova, and Illidan due to his unique mechanics and ability to dodge or mitigate damage [00:17:48].
*   **Disruption:** Murky can be very disruptive in team fights, drawing attention and forcing enemies to use abilities on him [00:20:51].

## Map-Specific Considerations
*   **Battlefield of Eternity:** This map's two-lane design means Murky cannot solely focus on pushing a separate lane as easily as on three-lane maps [00:27:44]. Players will need to balance pushing with contributing to the Immortal objectives more directly. Despite this, Murky can still push aggressively [00:17:06].

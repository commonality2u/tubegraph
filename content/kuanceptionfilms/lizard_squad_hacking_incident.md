The [[Lizard Squad hacking incident | Lizard Squad hacking incident]] refers to a series of cyberattacks primarily targeting gaming networks around the Christmas holiday season. These incidents made it difficult for some console gamers to enjoy the holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Who is Lizard Squad?
[[Identity and Anonymity in Online Gaming | Lizard Squad]] is described as a group of hackers, speculated to be "acne ridden 17-year-olds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> with "too much Doritos and Mountain Dew to spare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. They have claimed responsibility on multiple occasions for the hacks on [[Impact on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network | PlayStation Network]] (PSN) and [[Impact on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network | Xbox Live]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The group constantly tweeted threats to Sony and Microsoft, promising to take down PSN and Xbox Live, and were successful almost every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Impact on Gaming Networks
Prior to the hacks, [[Impact on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network | Xbox Live]] and [[Impact on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network | PlayStation Network]] were already considered "pretty crappy Network Services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. However, in the weeks leading up to Christmas, both networks consistently went down due to hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Sony and Microsoft, as the two largest gaming networks in the world, struggled to defend themselves against these attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Lizard Squad versus Finest Squad
A different group of anonymous hackers, known as [[Lizard Squad versus Finest Squad | Finest Squad]], claimed to have taken down [[Identity and Anonymity in Online Gaming | Lizard Squad]] about a week before Christmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. However, despite this claim, [[Identity and Anonymity in Online Gaming | Lizard Squad]] subsequently took down PSN and Xbox Live again on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Consequences for Gamers
The outages directly affected gamers, particularly during the Christmas holiday. For example, a hypothetical child receiving a new console bundle for Christmas would find the [[Impact on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network | PlayStation Network]] unavailable on Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This situation would lead to frustration and anger among players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Motivation
It is suggested that [[Identity and Anonymity in Online Gaming | Lizard Squad]] did not have a clear reason for their hacks, possibly acting out of boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

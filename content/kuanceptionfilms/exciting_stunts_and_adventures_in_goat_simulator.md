## Destructive Capabilities

A key aspect of the game involves the goat's "Invincible tongue," which allows it to drag objects like cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> and stop signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The game embraces [[destruction_physics_in_goat_simulator | destruction physics]], with the player frequently exclaiming "Get Wrecked" as objects are demolished or interacted with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The goat can also drag people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, embodying a carefree, destructive lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Stunts and Challenges

*   **Reaching New Levels** – The player successfully navigates to a new area, exclaiming, "yes we've made it now let's go up the next level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Defying Physics** – The game's bizarre logic allows for feats like a single "lick with a goat can destroy a whole car," which the player acknowledges as making "perfect sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Dangerous Tricks** – The player embarks on a "dangerous trick," acknowledging the risk of falling but deeming it "worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

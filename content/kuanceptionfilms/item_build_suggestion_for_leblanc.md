When playing [[character_and_skin_selection_in_league_of_legends | LeBlanc]], there are specific item choices recommended to maximize your effectiveness in [[league_of_legends_gameplay_strategy | League of Legends gameplay strategy]].

## Early Game Items

To start, you should buy your "hexagonal nut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

On your first back to base, it's advised to purchase the "spooky mask" and the "star root wand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>. These items are claimed to provide "true damage" that scales with the amount of gold you currently possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>.

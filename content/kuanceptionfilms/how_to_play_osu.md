This guide provides an unconventional approach to playing [[osu_skin_features | Osu]], emphasizing specific equipment choices and map selection strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Choosing Your Equipment

To play Osu, it is recommended to use a tablet and a keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The use of a mouse is explicitly discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This advice relates to [[choosing_the_right_equipment_for_osu | choosing the right equipment for Osu]].

## Getting Started

Once you have your equipment, load up the Osu game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Map Selection

Instead of starting with easier maps, players are advised to go "straight into the hard maps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Specifically, aiming for "the big black" map is suggested as beating it is considered impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This aggressive approach is part of [[starting_with_difficult_osu_maps | starting with difficult Osu maps]].

## Advanced Strategy for Impressing Others

To impress others with your Osu "skills," a particular strategy involves using auto mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

> "Don't tell anybody you actually put on auto." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

By utilizing [[using_auto_mode_in_osu | auto mode]], you can "beat the song with perfect combo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, giving the appearance of amazing Osu skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. [[achieving_a_perfect_combo_in_osu | Achieving a perfect combo in Osu]] is presented as the desired outcome using this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

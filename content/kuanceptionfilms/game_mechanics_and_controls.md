The video features a player's initial reactions and experiences with the [[gameplay_mechanics_and_item_usage | game mechanics]] and controls in *Goat Simulator* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Player Interaction with Environment

The player expresses confusion regarding the game's physics, questioning "why am I floating what's going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. They also inquire about the ability to "eat flowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, suggesting an interest in potential [[gameplay_mechanics_and_item_usage | item usage]] or interaction mechanics.

Difficulties were encountered when attempting to navigate, as the player repeatedly missed the ladder, stating, "oh I can't I keep missing the ladder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. They also observed a sudden change in game speed, asking, "Why is it slow now what did I do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The player attempted to interact with a character by licking, expressing frustration when the character didn't turn around: "why isn't he turning around I'm licking his freaking oh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. They also planned to use a "bounce" mechanic to engage with a character, stating, "I'm gonna get him this time just watch me bounce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Unintended Actions

The player occasionally performed actions unintentionally, exclaiming "whoops oh oh I didn't mean to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, and later remarking "I didn't even do anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> after an unexpected outcome.

## Observation of Non-Player Characters (NPCs)

Observations of NPCs included a man being on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> and a struggle to get an NPC to move, with the player asking, "why is he not why is he not coming come on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The player also noted a peculiar visual detail on an NPC, stating, "no there's grass in his butt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

This article explores various in-game mechanics and weapon balance issues that are specific to the PC version of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, highlighting both challenges and unique features.

## Aim Assist (Amissis) Concerns on PC

A notable issue in [[experiences_with_gameplay_on_pc | PC Black Ops 3]] is the implementation of aim assist, referred to as "amissis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. While mouse and keyboard users do not receive aim assist, which is typical for PC first-person shooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, players who use a controller on PC still benefit from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This creates an inconsistency in hardware performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. It is suggested that players using controllers on PC should cease doing so to mitigate this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

Unlike the generally well-balanced weapons on consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One), where there isn't a definitive "best gun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, [[comparison_of_weapon_optimization_between_pc_and_console | PC Black Ops 3]] suffers from significant gun imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Sniper rifles, particularly the Drakon and PO-6, are considered overpowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Lobbies are often dominated by these two weapons, indicating a clear imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. To address this, there is a strong suggestion for [[need_for_dedicated_pc_weapon_balancing_in_black_ops_3 | dedicated weapon balancing]] specifically for the PC community in Black Ops 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Unique PC Gaming Features and Advantages

Despite the challenges, playing Black Ops 3 on PC offers several advantageous features:

### Customizable Field of View (FOV)

PC players are not restricted by a locked FOV and can adjust it up to 120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Customizable FOV is a significant benefit in first-person shooters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, having been a feature in [[call_of_duty_console_vs_pc_gameplay | PC Call of Duty]] games for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. An increased FOV creates the perception of a faster-paced game and enhances player competitiveness by providing heightened visual and peripheral awareness, leading to stronger reactions in gunfights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### In-Game Text Chat

The PC version of Black Ops 3 includes a convenient in-game text chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This feature is widely used due to the ready availability of keyboards, allowing players to communicate easily without relying on microphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Upcoming Modding Capabilities

A significant future advantage for PC Black Ops 3 is the upcoming availability of [[pc_gaming_features_like_fov_customization_and_modding_in_black_ops_3 | PC modding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This will enable players to create custom multiplayer maps, zombie maps, modded game modes, and even introduce new weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

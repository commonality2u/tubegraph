A [[yugioh_value_cube_contents | Yu-Gi-Oh! Value Cube]] is typically described as containing 25 cards, two booster packs, and five foil cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, this description can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, as a value cube often includes a 40-card deck along with the stated 25 cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Contents of a Specific Value Cube (Fairy Structure Deck)

A particular [[yugioh_value_cube_openings | Yu-Gi-Oh! Value Cube]] purchased from Target for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, featured "The Agent of Mystery" Fairy Structure Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This specific structure deck was noted to be more expensive than the cube's $9.99 price online due to a lack of reprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Upon [[yugioh_value_cube_openings | opening Yugioh Card Packs]] for this cube, the following items were found:

*   Styrofoam filler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   The featured Structure Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   A [[promotional_yugioh_cards | promo pack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Value Assessment

Despite some misleading packaging and weak pulls from the booster packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, the value cube is considered a good deal for its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Since the price of a structure deck alone is typically $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, receiving guaranteed booster packs and a promo pack on top of the structure deck provides additional value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The inclusion of strong reprints like Shooting Quasar Dragon in the promo pack further enhances the cube's perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

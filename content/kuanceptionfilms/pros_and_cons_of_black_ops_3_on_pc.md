This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of purchasing and playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 on PC, especially given its status as the newest and most relevant Call of Duty title at the time of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The Call of Duty franchise itself originated on PC around 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

PC players often encounter several issues that detract from the experience:

### [[issues_with_player_base_on_pc_black_ops_3 | Small Player Base]]
The Call of Duty PC player base is considerably smaller than its console counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This results in an in-game playlist issue, where it's difficult to find enough players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Typically, matches can only be found in Team Deathmatch and Chaos Moshpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. On rare occasions, a Free-for-All or Gun Game lobby might be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Activision's marketing has largely targeted a younger, predominantly console-based audience, leading to a neglect of the PC consumer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Aim Assist Inconsistencies
Mouse and keyboard users do not have aim assist, as it has never been a demand for this input method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. However, players using a controller on PC still receive aim assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This creates an imbalance and inconsistency in hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | Optimization Issues]]
Random frame rate spikes are a common problem on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Even high-end systems, such as one with SLI 980ti GPUs, can experience inconsistent frame rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This is primarily attributed to a lack of optimization from Treyarch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, suggesting that Activision inadequately funds the PC versions of newer Call of Duty games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, a good AMD GPU might drop from 60 FPS to less than 15 FPS for several seconds when spawning into a map with many textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. In some cases, the game might not even load past the start menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Such severe optimization issues are rarely, if ever, found on consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### [[black_ops_3_weapon_balance_issues_on_pc | Weapon Imbalance]]
Unlike consoles where weapon balance is generally good and there isn't a single "best gun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, PC Black Ops 3 suffers from significant gun imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Sniper rifles, specifically the Drakon and P-06, are notably overpowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, dominating lobbies to the point where other guns are rarely seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. A dedicated weapon balancing system for the PC community is suggested as a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## [[advantages_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | Advantages of Playing Black Ops 3 on PC]]

Despite its drawbacks, Black Ops 3 on PC can offer a good experience:

### Customizable Field of View (FOV)
PC players are not restricted by a locked FOV and can maximize it up to 120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Customizable FOV has been a feature on PC Call of Duty titles for the most part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. An increased FOV creates the illusion of faster gameplay and enhances competitiveness by providing heightened visual awareness and peripheral senses, leading to better reactions in gunfights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Competitive Player Base
The PC community for Black Ops 3 is generally more competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. "Pub stomping" (dominating public matches) is less common, as most players have some FPS gaming experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This makes it a suitable environment for those who enjoy competitive play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Absence of Obnoxious Children
There are generally fewer young, obnoxious players on PC Black Ops 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### In-Game Text Chat
PC Black Ops 3 includes in-game text chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Players often prefer to communicate via text due to keyboard accessibility, making it convenient for expressing frustration or other sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### [[impact_of_modding_capabilities_in_black_ops_3_on_pc | Modding Capabilities]]
A significant incentive for PC Black Ops 3 is the upcoming availability of PC modding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This feature will allow players to create custom multiplayer and zombie maps, modded game modes, new weapons, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Final Verdict

Black Ops 3 was primarily developed for consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. If one owns a current-generation console, the PS4 or Xbox One version is generally recommended due to the PC version's setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. However, for players with a history of proficiency in PC first-person shooter games who appreciate the versatility and modding capabilities that come with PC gaming, purchasing Black Ops 3 for PC will likely not be regretted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

The [[yugioh_traptrix_december_2015_deck_profile | Traptrix December 2015 Deck Profile]] focuses on utilizing draw power engines to quickly access "Traptrix" cards, facilitate rank four and five Xyz plays, and establish a strong back row defense using various spell and trap cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Spell Cards

The deck incorporates several spell cards primarily for draw power and consistency, as well as for offensive and utility purposes:
*   **Raigeki** (1 copy) – Included for its obvious utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Soul Charge** (1 copy) – Considered very good in the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Pot of Duality** (number not specified, but mentioned as draw power) – Used as a draw power engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Upstart Goblin** (3 copies) – Standard in the format and essential for maximum consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Instant Fusion** (3 copies) – Used to summon Nordans, which are particularly good for making rank four plays in the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Terraforming** (3 copies) – Included because the deck runs three copies of Chicken Game and two copies of Pseudo Space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Chicken Game** (3 copies) – Functions as an excellent draw power mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Pseudo Space** (2 copies) – Included to act as an additional copy of Chicken Game, leveraging the three Terraforming cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon (MST)** (3 copies) – Considered very standard in the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Trap Cards

A robust trap lineup provides the deck's defensive backbone and control elements:
*   **Solemn Warning** (1 copy) – Standard in the format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Trap Hole Cards** (3 copies total) – The deck runs a combination of specific "Trap Hole" cards:
    *   **Bottomless Trap Hole** (1 copy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
    *   **Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare** (2 copies) – This card negates effects and acts similarly to Bottomless Trap Hole, specifically when an opponent special summons a monster and uses its effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. These can be searched by [[Traptrix monster card effects and combinations | Traptrix Myrmeleo]] and reused by [[Traptrix monster card effects and combinations | Traptrix Dionaea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device** (1 copy) – Described as a "sexy" and standard card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Mirror Force** (1 copy) – Used for anti-attacking measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Dimensional Prison** (1 copy) – Also used for anti-attacking, helping to remove opponent's monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Vanity's Emptiness** (1 copy) – Very standard in the format; it prevents opponents from special summoning, making it difficult for them to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Call of the Haunted** (1 copy) – A multi-purpose card that allows for special summoning monsters to trigger their effects, such as [[Traptrix monster card effects and combinations | Myrmeleo]] for searching a Trap Hole or [[Traptrix monster card effects and combinations | Dionaea]] for popping a spell/trap card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Breakthrough Skill** (1 copy) – Used to negate effects, described as "very essential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

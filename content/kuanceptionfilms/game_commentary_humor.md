## Characteristics of Commentary Humor

Commentators often incorporate humor through:
*   **Informal Openings**: Starting a video with dramatic or quirky statements, such as "in a world infested with gappers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, sets a lighthearted tone.
*   **Self-Deprecation**: Acknowledging personal mistakes or poor performance, like "I go over here I try to snipe I fail I die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, can be a source of humor and relatability.
*   **Exaggerated Reactions and Language**:
    *   Playful insults or hyperbole directed at opponents, e.g., "that guy sucks he had like 10 years to kill me and he didn't kill me like are you for real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   Exclamations of surprise or frustration, such as "Jesus H Christ" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> or "Mother of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   Boastful and taunting remarks after successful plays, like "Bam Bam ain't got nothing you can do about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> or "That's what I thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Sarcasm and Irony**: Making sarcastic comments about achievements or situations, for instance, "oh we The Rescuer now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> when performing a minor action.
*   **Conversational Style**: Directly addressing the audience with phrases like "if you know what I'm saying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> or "what you gots to do dude, you know what I'm saying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> creates an informal, engaging atmosphere.
*   **Playful Self-Correction**: Building up an achievement only to playfully deflate it, such as "oh look at that double soda sexy and then got that triple almost and I almost got that quad just kidding I didn't even get a triple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

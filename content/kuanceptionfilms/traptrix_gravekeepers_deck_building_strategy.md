Its effectiveness in competitive play is demonstrated through online gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Deck Overview

This [[Yugioh deck building strategies | deck building strategy]] focuses on combining the control and trap-setting capabilities of the Traptrix archetype with the anti-graveyard and stat-boosting effects of Gravekeepers, alongside other generic lockdown and burn cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Monster Lineup

The monster lineup primarily consists of Level 4 monsters to facilitate Rank 4 Xyz summons, alongside specific cards that create lockdown conditions or provide burn damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

*   **Traptrix Myrmeleo** (x2): Essential for the deck. When Normal Summoned, it adds a "Hole" Normal Trap Card from your Deck to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. When Special Summoned, it can destroy a Spell/Trap Card your opponent controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Traptrix Dionaea** (x2): Special Summons a Traptrix monster from the Graveyard when Normal Summoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. When Special Summoned, it adds a "Hole" Normal Trap Card from your Graveyard to your hand, allowing for reuse of cards like Bottomless Trap Hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Traptrix Myrmeleo Nepenthes** (x2): Possesses high defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Traptrix Atrax** (x1): Has high attack and a useful effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   *Note*: For more detailed [[Traptrix monster card effects and combinations | Traptrix monster card effects and combinations]], refer to their individual wiki pages.
*   **Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo** (x1): A crucial [[Key Cards in Traptrix Gravekeepers Deck | key card]] for lockdown. It prevents both players from Special Summoning monsters. When flipped face-up, it destroys all Special Summoned monsters on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The deck includes ways to protect it from attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Gravekeeper's Spy** (x2): Considered the best Level 4 Gravekeeper for this deck. When flipped face-up, it Special Summons another Gravekeeper's monster with 1500 or less ATK from the deck, allowing for immediate Rank 4 Xyz Summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
    *   *Note*: The deck is specifically a [[Gravekeeper structure deck | Traptrix Gravekeepers]] hybrid.
*   **Summoner Monk** (x1): Useful for getting out Level 4 monsters from the deck to facilitate Rank 4 Xyz Summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Can Special Summon Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo to initiate a lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Kagetokage** (x1): Can be Special Summoned from the hand when a Level 4 monster is Normal Summoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Malefic Stardust Dragon** (x1): Provides extra attack power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. It can be Special Summoned by banishing a Stardust Dragon from the Extra Deck, effectively not taking up main deck space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Its usability is high due to the presence of many field cards in the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Santa Claws** (x1): Excellent for removing difficult opponent monsters like Quasar or Cyber Dragon Infinity by tributing them, as its tribute summon cannot be negated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Spell Lineup

The spell lineup focuses on controlling the field, providing draw power, and setting up specific lockdown conditions.

*   **Black Garden** (x1): An "insane" trolly field card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. When a monster is Normal or Special Summoned, its ATK is halved, and the opposing player can Special Summon a Level 2, 800 ATK/800 DEF token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This can be used to build a token army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Necrovalley** (x2): Really essential. It boosts the ATK/DEF of Gravekeeper's Spy and prevents opponents from Special Summoning monsters from the graveyard, effectively shutting down many decks like Shaddoll and Stellarknight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Terraforming** (x2): Provides draw power for field cards, ensuring they are accessible early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Dark Hole** (x1): A destruction card useful for clearing the field, especially given some monsters have graveyard effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Raigeki is an alternative, but Dark Hole is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Swords of Revealing Light** (x2): Used for stalling, fitting the deck's lockdown and troll nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Preferred over Gravity Bind due to the prevalence of Xyz monsters which are unaffected by Gravity Bind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Burden of the Mighty** (x1): A trolling card that reduces each face-up monster's ATK by 100 times its own level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon** (x1): For essential Spell/Trap removal, particularly continuous ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Twin Twisters is an alternative.

## Trap Lineup

The trap lineup is the core of the deck's control, lockdown, and burn strategy.

*   **Bottomless Trap Hole** (x1): A [[Key spells and trap cards in Traptrix deck | key trap]] for removing strong Special Summoned monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Traptrix monsters help bring it out easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. It's limited to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Trap Hole** (x2): While many players avoid it due to Special Summoning, it becomes powerful when Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo is on the field, forcing opponents to Normal Summon into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare** (x1): A very good trap. When a monster that was Special Summoned this turn activates its effect on the opponent's side of the field, it negates that effect and destroys the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Deep Dark Trap Hole** (x1): A backup for Bottomless Trap Hole. When a Level 5 or higher effect monster is Special Summoned, it banishes that monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Solemn Warning** (x1): An essential, trolly card that negates the summoning of any monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Nightmare Wheel** (x2): Preferred over Fiendish Chain. It prevents the opponent's monster from attacking and inflicts 500 damage to the opponent during each of your standby phases, contributing to the deck's burn strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Coffin Seller** (x1): Provides extra burn power. Each time a monster card is sent to the opponent's Graveyard, inflict 300 damage to the opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Mirror Force** (x1): For obvious defensive reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Scrap-Iron Scarecrow** (x1): A trolly card for continuous defensive power, as it resets itself face-down instead of going to the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Magic Cylinder** (x1): Provides extra defensive power and significant burn damage against high ATK monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Wall of Disruption** (x1): A strong alternative to Mirror Force. When an opponent's monster declares an attack, all opponent's attack position monsters lose 800 ATK for each monster they control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. For example, three attack position monsters would each lose 2400 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device** (x1): An essential removal trap card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Ceasefire** (x2): Provides significant extra burn power. Inflicts 500 damage to the opponent for each monster on the field. Activating two can deal 6000 damage if there are six monsters on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Extra Deck

The Extra Deck primarily consists of Rank 4 Xyz monsters, with a focus on specific [[Key Cards in Traptrix Gravekeepers Deck | key cards]] for utility and lockdown setup. The Extra Deck is flexible, allowing for personal preferences, as long as it includes essential Rank 4 Xyz monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

*   **Leviair the Sea Dragon** (x1): Essential for setting up Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo on top of the deck and for general milling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Number 101: Silent Honor ARK** (x1): A "broken" and excellent defensive Rank 4 Xyz monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Number 50: Blackship of Corn** (x1): Has a good effect, dealing 1000 damage per turn if the opponent has a monster with less ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Number 55: Gogogo Goliath** (x1): A temporary inclusion with a good effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Number 39: Utopia** (x1): Considered an essential Rank 4 Xyz card for any deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Stardust Dragon** (x1): Included solely to enable the summoning of Malefic Stardust Dragon from the hand, as the deck does not include tuners to Synchro Summon it conventionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. It doesn't take up main deck space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon**: A planned addition once a reprint makes it more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Hackers significantly affect the multiplayer experience across various Call of Duty titles, particularly older ones, making it difficult for players to enjoy classic gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The presence of hackers, boosters, and other forms of "BS" has rendered many servers almost unplayable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
The [[condition_of_call_of_duty_4_servers | Call of Duty 4 servers]] on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are described as "broken" due to widespread hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Gameplay footage often includes examples of hacked lobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This is particularly disappointing given that Call of Duty 4 is considered by some to be the purest and best Call of Duty game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, but developer Infinity Ward is perceived to be neglecting the [[condition_of_call_of_duty_4_servers | conditions of its servers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Modern Warfare 2 and World at War
Similar to Call of Duty 4, both Modern Warfare 2 and World at War suffer from significant issues with hackers and boosters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Despite being praised for their multiplayer experiences, it is nearly impossible to find a clean lobby without disruptive elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Player Experience and Impact
The prevalence of hackers in older Call of Duty titles like Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare 2, and World at War has led to a situation where players cannot return to enjoy the classic multiplayer experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This forces players to instead play newer games like Black Ops 2 or Modern Warfare 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The continuous need to play Black Ops 2 for multiple years due to the poor conditions of other servers highlights the frustration caused by these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

> "It makes me pretty sad because Cod 4 is essentially the purest and arguably the best Call of Duty game but Infinity War devs basically don't give a crap about the conditions of its servers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

## Proposed Solution: HD Remasters
A suggested solution to combat the pervasive hacking and improve the player experience for beloved titles is the release of HD remasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Specifically, an HD remaster of Call of Duty 4 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is proposed, featuring enhanced graphics and brand new, playable servers free of hackers and "BS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The idea also extends to a Modern Warfare 2 HD remaster released a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While such remasters might potentially drive sales away from newer Call of Duty games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, many players express a strong desire for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The Ferry Structure Deck is a Yu-Gi-Oh! product that was available as part of a "Value Cube" bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Overview

This specific Value Cube bundle, which includes the Ferry Structure Deck, retailed for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The Ferry [[yugioh_structure_decks_and_starter_decks_comparison | structure deck]] itself is noted to be more expensive when purchased individually online, exceeding the $9.99 price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This higher price is attributed to the deck never receiving a reprint, impacting its supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The Value Cube was purchased from Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Contents

The Value Cube containing the Ferry Structure Deck advertises "25 cards plus 2 boosters and 5 foil cards in every pack," but the actual contents are a 40-card deck along with the 25 cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

When unboxed, the Value Cube included:
*   The Ferry [[yugioh_structure_decks_and_starter_decks_comparison | structure deck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

    *   A third booster pack, *Lord of the Noble Knights*, was also present, which comes with the Noble Knights [[yugioh_structure_decks_and_starter_decks_comparison | structure deck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Value

The Value Cubes are considered a good purchase for their price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Since the $9.99 price for the Value Cube is typically the cost of a standalone [[yugioh_structure_decks_and_starter_decks_comparison | structure deck]], getting two additional booster packs and a promo pack provides significant added value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The inclusion of good reprints like Shooting Quasar Dragon in the promo pack further enhances the overall value of the cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

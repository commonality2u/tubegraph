Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 (BO3) on PC has raised questions about its viability and whether it's a smart purchase for consumers, particularly concerning its performance and optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. While the Call of Duty franchise originated on PC around 2003, newer titles like BO3 have presented specific challenges for the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Optimization Challenges

A significant concern for PC players is the presence of [[optimization_problems_in_black_ops_3 | optimization problems in Black Ops 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Inconsistent Frame Rates
Random frame rate drops are a recurring issue on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Even high-end systems, such as one with SLI 980ti GPUs, experience inconsistent frame rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The game may suffer severe frame drops, plummeting from 60 FPS to under 15 FPS for several seconds, especially when spawning into maps with a high number of textures, even on capable GPUs like the AMD 930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This is largely attributed to [[pc_gaming_optimization_issues_in_black_ops_3 | optimization problems in Black Ops 3]] on Treyarch's part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, suggesting a lack of proper funding for the PC version from Activision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Game Loading Issues
Some users report that the game fails to load past the start menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Such severe [[optimization_problems_in_black_ops_3 | optimization issues]] are rarely, if ever, encountered on [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | PlayStation 4 or Xbox One]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Hardware Inconsistencies and Aim Assist
The inconsistency of hardware on PC can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. A notable issue is the presence of aim assist for controller users on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, while mouse and keyboard users do not receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This creates an imbalance, as most players struggle to play Call of Duty with a controller without aim assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Other [[pros_and_cons_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | PC-Specific Issues]]

*   **Player Base**: The PC player base for Call of Duty is notably smaller, leading to playlist issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Matches are typically only found in Team Deathmatch and Chaos Moshpit, with Free-For-All or Gun Game lobbies being rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This is partly due to Activision's marketing success with a younger, predominantly console-based audience, leading to neglect of the PC consumer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Weapon Imbalance**: Unlike consoles where gun balance is generally good with no single "best gun," the PC version suffers from apparent gun imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Sniper rifles, particularly the Drakon and PO6, are considered overpowered and dominate lobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This has led to suggestions for a [[need_for_dedicated_pc_weapon_balancing_in_black_ops_3 | dedicated weapon balancing for Black Ops 3 on PC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## [[pros_and_cons_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | Advantages of Playing on PC]]

Despite the challenges, BO3 on PC offers several advantages:

*   **Customizable FOV**: PC players are not restricted by a locked Field of View (FOV) and can set it up to 120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. An increased FOV creates the illusion of faster gameplay and enhances visual awareness and peripheral senses, leading to more competitive players with stronger reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Competitive Environment**: The [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC community]] is generally more competitive, with most players possessing some FPS gaming experience, resulting in fewer instances of "pub stomping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. There are also fewer "obnoxious children" compared to console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **In-Game Text Chat**: The convenience of in-game text chat is a significant feature, allowing players to communicate easily without microphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Modding Capability**: A major incentive for PC purchase is the upcoming availability of [[pc_gaming_features_like_fov_customization_and_modding_in_black_ops_3 | PC modding for Black Ops 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This feature will allow for custom multiplayer and zombie maps, modded game modes, and new guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Conclusion

Black Ops 3 was primarily developed for consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. For those owning a current-generation console, purchasing the PS4 or Xbox One version is generally recommended due to the PC version's setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. However, for players with a history of proficiency in PC first-person shooters who value the versatility and modding capabilities of PC games, the PC version of Black Ops 3 may still be a worthwhile investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

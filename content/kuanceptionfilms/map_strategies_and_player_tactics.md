This article outlines some [[ingame_strategies_and_tactics|in-game strategies]] and player [[multiplayer_strategies|tactics]] observed during a *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* "Gun Game" match on PC.

## Map Selection and Familiarity
The player expressed a lack of familiarity with the "Breach" map, stating, "I've never actually played that map so I'm going to go ahead and vote for random though breaches probably gonna wind up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>. Despite this, the map was eventually played.

## Player Tactics
### Camping
A "camping tactic" was acknowledged as being "visibly too stronk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>.

### Engaging and Disengaging
Players were observed to engage in fights, or choose not to engage, with the commentator noting about an opponent, "he's not engaging in a fight you don't want to fight us he knows he knows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Challenges
The player emphasized the importance of performing well ("varsity") regardless of the difficulty of the weapon, stating, "This next shotguns pretty hard for me to use butter but we got to be parsed we got to be parsed regardless of whether it's hard or not we gonna do good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### "Fisting" AFK Players
A specific [[game_strategy|strategy]] for securing the win in "Gun Game" involved "fisting" (meleeing) an AFK (Away From Keyboard) opponent for the final kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. The player explicitly stated, "We just want this by fisting the AFK man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a> and celebrated the "victor of quad scepter films we just fisted the last man for the last kill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. This tactic was reiterated as "we fist in everyone today we fist a look at that AFK fist AFK fist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

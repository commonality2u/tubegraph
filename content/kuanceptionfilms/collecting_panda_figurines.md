### Figurines Description

*   **Traditional Bumblebee Panda**
    *   This figurine features two black stripes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   It has black ears and circles around its eyes, resembling a raccoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Ultra Rare Panda Figurine**
    *   This figurine is described as "ultra rare," causing the host to become very excited and even shed tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   It is broken, indicated by a jingling sound inside, but this does not diminish its perceived value or rarity to the host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   Despite its ultra-rare status, the host believes it can be sold for "about like two cents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Small but Mighty Panda Figurine**
    *   This small figurine is considered "mighty powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
    *   It has an ability to clear the entire YuGiOh battle arena of cards, figurines, wax figures, and bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   Its effect can be combined with a blue 10 or 25 League of Legends RP card; placing the figurine on top of the card results in an automatic win of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

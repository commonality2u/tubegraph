Communication among players during [[gaming_discussions|gameplay]] is crucial for coordination and strategy. The players in this session utilize various forms of communication, including direct verbal exchanges and inferred coordination.

## Verbal Communication
Players engage in direct verbal communication to coordinate actions, share observations, and provide [[gaming_discussions|advice]].

*   A player states they cannot hear another participant at the beginning of the session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   Players recall shared past experiences, asking "Does anybody else remember?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   Direct [[gaming_discussions|advice]] and encouragement are given regarding in-game actions, such as "Nah, it's a good idea. Do it. Just do it" in response to a player's hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Strategic statements are made, like "Build an AD now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> and "I don't need farm with NASA's top lane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   A player directs teammates to "Get in the group back" to regroup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Strategy is discussed, with one player confirming, "I'm pretty sure that this is um Thresh carry. Yeah. Good. Go. Go for it. Go for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   During [[ingame_events_and_actions|combat]], a player shouts "Kill the nas. Jesus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   [[gaming_humor_and_banter|Banter]] and self-deprecating humor are present, such as "Don't mind me. Thresh top doesn't do anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> and "I can't lie. I'm pretty I'm pretty hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, followed by "I think we all are after that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Skype Calls
The topic of communication extends to how teams organize themselves outside of the game.

*   Players observe that opponents might be using a "different Skype call or something," indicating a common practice for team communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   There's a reaction to this, with a player expressing, "That's dumb. They should invite us," suggesting a desire for more inclusive or transparent communication channels between teams or within a larger group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Player Commentary and Strategy
Players also provide [[gaming_commentary|commentary]] on their own actions and the game state, reflecting their internal thought processes and communicating their rationale to teammates.

*   A player expresses a desire to "flash hook" but feels they "shouldn't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Frustration is voiced regarding the Annie jungle pick, asking "why is any jungle a thing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   A player notes that the "Annie is going to do some real stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   A player articulates their internal struggle with kill distribution, stating they were trying to be "calm down, not say anything," and not be a "greedy AD carry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   They then express dissatisfaction when an ally has more kills than them 24 minutes into the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   A player observes the opponent's item progression, noting that the enemy Jinx "doesn't even have an IE yet" while they have "three items" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

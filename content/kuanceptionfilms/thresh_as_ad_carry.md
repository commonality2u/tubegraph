Thresh, typically played as a support champion in [[League of Legends gameplay | League of Legends]], is experimented with in an Attack Damage (AD) carry role in this gameplay session. This unconventional playstyle involves building AD items and taking on a primary damage-dealing role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Gameplay Observations

Initially, there's a sarcastic remark about "Thresh top doesn't do anything," implying the opposite is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The players explicitly identify the strategy as "Thresh carry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Performance as an AD Carry

Despite Thresh not being a traditional [[role_of_adc_in_league_of_legends | AD carry]], this build proves to be surprisingly effective. The Thresh player accumulates more kills than the team's designated [[role_of_adc_in_league_of_legends | AD carry]] by the 24-minute mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The Thresh player also notes having three items, indicating good progress in their build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The effectiveness of AD Thresh even prompts a player to comment on its viability in ranked play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Team Dynamics

The performance of AD Thresh leads to some team dynamic shifts. The traditional [[role_of_adc_in_league_of_legends | AD carry]] expresses frustration, stating they are "not a greedy [[role_of_adc_in_league_of_legends | AD carry]]" and expect kills later in the game, especially since the opposing team is "really bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. However, the unexpected success of AD Thresh upsets this expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Abilities Used

Throughout the gameplay, standard Thresh abilities are utilized:
*   **Hooks**: Thresh's signature ability, often used for initiating combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Flash Hooks**: A common [[League of Legends gameplay strategies | strategy]] where Flash is used to surprise enemies with a hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, though it can sometimes be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Blade and Soul is a "brand new MMORPG" that had been out for a little over a week at the time of recording, already attracting millions of registered players, making it "the new thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Character Creation
The game features extensive [[character_customization_in_blade_and_soul | character customization]] options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Players can choose from various classes, including Assassin, Blade Master, and Kung Fu Master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The Blade Master is noted as potentially the "least difficult to play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The [[character_customization_in_blade_and_soul | customization]] includes:
*   **Hair**: Options range from long hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> to "Motta afro intense" styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, with observations that changing hair can make characters resemble "Naruto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Hair Color**: Options like blue, green, or white are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Racial Attributes**: A "stat boost" is humorously suggested for making a character black, potentially offering a 30% boost in strength and agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Facial Features**: Players can change facial types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> and adjust "facial hair density" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Body Type**: There are minimal differences in body types, though characters can significantly lose height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Facial Decorations and Lip Gloss**: Additional details like lip gloss can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

A prominent feature highlighted during [[character_customization_in_blade_and_soul | character customization]] is the extensive [[jiggle_physics_in_blade_and_soul | jiggle physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This feature is noted to be very intense, especially when graphics settings are maximized, potentially impacting lower-end systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Initial [[gameplay experience]]
Upon starting the game, players may face significant [[Blade and Soul queue times and server selection | queue times]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. One player humorously exaggerated queue times to be "five billion hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, while another logged in "a week ago" and "just got on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The game begins with an initial cutscene showing the character presumably floating in the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The early game involves tutorial elements and quests, such as being equipped with a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> and being tasked to wake up an NPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

The user played on "800 by 600 window at the lowest graphic possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Despite this, the water effects are described as impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Players are introduced to basic mechanics, including sprinting and complex combos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The in-game map is described as intuitive, helping players navigate to objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. New abilities, such as "glide," are learned early in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## [[Blade and Soul combat and skills | Combat and Skills]]
The game features a dynamic [[blade_and_soul_combat_and_skills | combat]] system. Early [[blade_and_soul_combat_and_skills | combat]] involves training against dummies to learn skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. The experience bar does not move after killing some initial enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, but leveling up provides an "XP boost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Skills and equipment are granted by NPCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. The [[blade_and_soul_combat_and_skills | combat]] is noted for its intense combos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, although it's humorously described as "complete trash" later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Players also gain "decoy stance" abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

The game's initial [[gameplay experience]] includes cutscenes and encounters that unfold a narrative, described as "straight out of Naruto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The tutorial concludes at a beach area, which marks the end of the initial [[gameplay experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

Black Ops 3 was released with considerable excitement, described by players as a "great fun" game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, its launch revealed varying levels of [[performance_issues_in_gaming | performance issues]] and [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | optimization challenges]] across different gaming platforms.

## PC Version Challenges
The PC version of Black Ops 3 presented a "bit of a learning curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> and a noticeable lack of optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Players expressed hope that these [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | issues]] would be addressed in the weeks following release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Beyond general [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | optimization issues]], the PC version also experienced specific [[frame_rate_issues_and_optimization | technical difficulties]]:
*   **[[Frame_rate_issues_and_optimization | Frame Drops]]**: The game could suffer from "crapped on a screen like right now frame drop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, with severe instances described as "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, even if players managed to secure kills despite them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Player Base and [[gaming_challenges | Competitive Landscape]]
The PC platform was noted for having the "most competitive demographic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, with players being "pretty trihard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This high level of competition, combined with potential [[issues_with_player_base_on_pc_black_ops_3 | issues with player base]] size, led to difficulties finding matches, sometimes taking five minutes or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Console [[pc_versus_console_gameplay_performance | Performance]]
In contrast to the PC version, the PlayStation 4 version of Black Ops 3 was observed to be "running very well" and "very fun to play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

However, older generation consoles were not recommended for purchase due to poor performance:
*   **Last-Gen Consoles**: The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions were deemed "not a very good investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> and "probably not very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Despite the "shitty" experience on the PC version at the time of release, players still found enjoyment in game modes like Gun Game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

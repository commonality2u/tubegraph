## Unboxing Procedure

The unboxing commenced with the Yu-Gi-Oh! Star Pack 2013 booster box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The method of opening the box involved using "fingertips as an unboxing scissors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> and "slap[ping] it open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The booster box contains 50 packs, with each pack holding three cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Once opened, the 50 packs were divided into two stacks of 25 packs each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Card Arrangement

As individual packs were opened, the cards were sorted into two distinct piles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>:
*   **Foil Pile:** This pile was designated for [[unboxing_and_rare_cards | foil]] cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Examples of cards placed in this pile include Zubaba Knight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, Elemental HERO Escuridao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, Black Ray Lancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, Gagaga Magician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, One-for-One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, Earth Armor Ninja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, Ego Boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, Wonder Wand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, and Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Commons Pile:** This pile was for common cards, referred to as "comets" in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Cards such as Needle Sunfish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, Arcana X The Dark Ruler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, Heartfelt Appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, Goblin Berg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, and Granosaurus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> were placed here.

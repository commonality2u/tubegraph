Osu! is a rhythm game where players interact with on-screen elements to the beat of a song. The game incorporates various terms and mechanics that are central to [[how_to_play_osu | gameplay]] and [[improving_performance_and_accuracy in osu | performance]].

## Core Gameplay Elements

*   **Songs/Maps**: Players select and play different "songs" or "maps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. These are pre-designed sequences of hit objects synchronized with music.
*   **Hit Objects**: Gameplay involves hitting various objects. Examples mentioned include "jumps," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> which are specific patterns requiring quick cursor movements to multiple, spread-out targets. Other mechanics include "stream crossmap jumps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, which combine continuous streams of notes with wide cursor jumps.
*   **Accuracy**: A crucial metric in Osu! that measures how precisely a player hits the objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Accuracy percentages, such as 83%, 84%, or 92%, are displayed during gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Higher accuracy generally leads to better scores and ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Score**: Represents the total points accumulated during a play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Scores are influenced by multipliers, such as "x7 x lates" (likely referring to combo multipliers or hit accuracy bonuses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Achieving a score over 1 million points is considered a significant benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Spinners ("Kappa")**: Some maps feature spinners that players must rapidly spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The visual representation of a spinner might be called a "Kappa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Ranking System

The ranking system in Osu! is based on "Performance Points" (PP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

*   **Ranks**: A player's global position is indicated by their rank number. For example, "70k" refers to rank 70,000, while "14k" refers to rank 14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Lower numbers indicate a higher rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   [[understanding_rank_definitions_in_osu | **Rank Progression**]]:
    *   **Gaining Rank**: Moving "up in rank" means progressing towards rank one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This is considered a positive progression.
    *   **Losing Rank**: Moving "down in rank" or receiving a "minus" rank means progressing away from rank one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This is considered a negative progression, where players are "falling down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Interface Elements

*   **Skip Button**: Allows players to skip parts of the song, often the introductory sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. A distinct "skip buzz" sound may accompany its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

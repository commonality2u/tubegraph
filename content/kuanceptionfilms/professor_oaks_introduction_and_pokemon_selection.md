The video begins with an introduction to the world of Pokémon by Professor Oak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. He explains that the world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon, which the commentator sarcastically reinterprets as "animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Professor Oak later reiterates that it's unsafe to go into tall grass without a Pokémon for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, implying Pokémon are for "slaves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Character and Rival Naming

When prompted to [[starting_the_game_and_choosing_a_character | start the game and choose a character]], the player opts to be a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The player character is named "69" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The rival character is subsequently named "169" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Choosing a Starter Pokémon

Professor Oak offers the player a choice of their own Pokémon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The player selects Squirtle, stating they have already used all other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The chosen Squirtle is then named "slave" by the player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## First Rival Battle

Immediately after the Pokémon selection, the rival challenges the player to a [[first_pokemon_battle_and_strategies | battle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The player expresses confusion and reluctance about the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The battle is described as a "freaking Turtle against a rat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The player recalls their initial experience with this game, finding this battle "impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. After the battle concludes, the rival bids farewell with "smell you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

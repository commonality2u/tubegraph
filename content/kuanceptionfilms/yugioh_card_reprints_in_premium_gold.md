Premium Gold Infinite Gold is a Yu-Gi-Oh! product featuring cards with a "very royal" red and gold box art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The product is considered "very exciting every year" by fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It was released around March 18th, 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Focus on Reprints

A key aspect of Premium Gold is the inclusion of numerous [[reprints_of_classic_yugioh_cards | reprints]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The video expresses excitement about opening the product to find "dank Exceeds card[s], some dank Pendulum [[reprints_of_classic_yugioh_cards | reprints]], some really good Cosmo cards, [and] some nice Trap cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The cards in Premium Gold have a distinctive gold aesthetic, which is highly appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Impact on Card Market Value

While the presence of [[reprints_of_classic_yugioh_cards | reprints]] is exciting for collectors, it is noted that Konami's strategy of reprinting cards can negatively affect the [[yugioh_card_market_value | market value]] of existing copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The State of Classic Call of Duty Titles

Classic Call of Duty games such as Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare 2, and World at War, while offering "amazing multiplayer experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, suffer from severe issues on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The developer, Infinity Ward, is perceived as not prioritizing the [[condition_of_call_of_duty_4_servers | condition of their servers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Problem: Unplayable Online Experiences

The [[condition_of_call_of_duty_4_servers | servers for Call of Duty 4]] are described as "broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, with "thousands" of examples of hacked lobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It is nearly impossible to find a lobby or server in Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare 2, or World at War that is free from hackers, boosters, or other forms of "BS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This poor [[condition_of_call_of_duty_4_servers | server condition]] prevents players from enjoying the classic Call of Duty multiplayer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, forcing them to play newer titles like Black Ops 2 or Modern Warfare 3 instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Concerns also exist about the quality of upcoming games like [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Advanced Warfare]], with the fear it might be another disappointment like Call of Duty Ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Solution: A Call of Duty 4 HD Remaster

Given that Call of Duty 4 is regarded as "essentially the purest and arguably the best Call of Duty game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> and was loved by "every Call of Duty fan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, a proposal has been made for Infinity Ward to create an HD remaster for [[sony_playstation_4_excitement | PS4]] and Xbox One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Proposed Features

A remastered version would ideally include:
*   Enhanced graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Brand new, playable servers free from hackers and "BS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Release Vision

The ideal release scenario would be for the game to be available for download on the PlayStation Store and Xbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Furthermore, it is suggested that an HD remaster of Modern Warfare 2 could follow exactly a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

> "I am drooling just at the thought of this proposal it is seriously a great idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>

### Potential Impact

While a Call of Duty 4 remaster could potentially divert sales from [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Advanced Warfare]] and other [[future_possibilities_for_call_of_duty_franchises | future Call of Duty games]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, some enthusiasts express that they "really don't give a crap" about this commercial consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The concept of a Call of Duty 4 remaster for current-generation consoles is put forward as a desirable prospect for the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

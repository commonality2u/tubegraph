The Yosenju archetype is noted as one of the best budget decks available in the game, capable of being built for under $40, or even under $30 if the [[extra_deck_cards_for_yosenju | Extra Deck]] is disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It's described as an "anti-meta" Tier 2 deck that can inflict significant damage to Tier 1 decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Core Strategy

The primary [[yugioh_deck_building_strategies | strategy]] of a Yosenju deck revolves around spamming normal summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This deck intentionally avoids special summoning, which is considered a core aspect of its unique gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Yosenju monsters typically return to the hand at the end of the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Key Monsters and Their Uses

*   **Yosenju Kama 1 (x3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
    *   **Effect:** Sends any face-up card your opponent controls back to their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Helps facilitate additional Normal Summons of Yosenju cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Acts like an "automatic Compulsion" and a "Double Summon" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Kama 2 (x3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   **Effect:** Allows direct attacks for half damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Provides an additional Normal Summon for another Yosenju card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Kama 3 (x3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    *   **Effect:** When another Yosenju card deals damage to your opponent, you can search your deck for a Yosenju card and add it to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Excellent combo piece with Kama 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A direct attack from Kama 2 triggers Kama 3's effect, allowing you to search for another Yosenju for an additional Normal Summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Can search for Yosenju Tsujik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Tsujik (x3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
    *   **Effect 1:** Can be discarded during the Damage Step to give a Yosenju card 1000 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. (Similar to "Honest") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   **Effect 2:** If Normal Summoned, can target one Yosenju card on the field to gain 1000 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. (Similar to "Jain Ghetto") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** A multi-purpose card for offensive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Shinchu L (x2)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
    *   **Type:** The only Pendulum card run in this non-Pendulum Yosenju build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, chosen for its speed and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   **Pendulum Effect:** If a Yosenju monster you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can destroy this card instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Provides defensive measures for Yosenju monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Can be strategically used with Yosenju Secret Move to activate its effect even if no other monsters are controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Cardcar D (x3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
    *   **Strategy:** Provides significant [[yugioh_card_game_strategy_insights | draw power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The deck's strong trap line-up allows for defense even with no monsters on the field after using Cardcar D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Recommended Spells and Traps

### Spell Cards
[[recommended_spells_and_traps_for_yosenju_deck | Recommended spells and traps for Yosenju deck]] often focus on consistency, disruption, and protection.

*   **Fire Formation - Tenki (x3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
    *   **Strategy:** Excellent draw power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Can search for any Yosenju monster and provides a continuous 100 ATK boost to all Beast-Warrior monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Dimensional Fissure (x3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
    *   **Effect:** Any monster sent to the graveyard is banished instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** A "floodgate" card that doesn't negatively impact Yosenju, as their monsters return to hand and they don't special summon from the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Effective against decks that rely on graveyard effects, such as Shaddolls and Heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Book of Moon (x1)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
    *   **Strategy:** An essential card for any deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon (MST) (x2)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
    *   **Strategy:** Essential for backrow removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Pot of Duality (x3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
    *   **Effect:** Allows you to look at the top three cards of your deck, add one to your hand, but you cannot Special Summon during that turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Heavily "abused" in this deck because the special summoning restriction is irrelevant for Yosenju <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Provides vital [[yugioh_deck_building_tips | deck building tips]] for consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Upstart Goblin (x1)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
    *   **Strategy:** Great draw power, especially needed for a deck with few monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Dark Hole (x2)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
    *   **Strategy:** Preferred over Raigeki due to Yosenju monsters returning to the hand on the opponent's turn, ensuring your field is often empty when used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Trap Cards

*   **Yosenju Secret Move (x3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
    *   **Effect:** When a Spell/Trap Card or monster effect is activated while you control at least one Yosenju monster (or if all face-up monsters you control are Yosenju monsters), you can negate the activation and destroy that card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Very powerful, especially with Yosenju Shinchu L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Its effect can be activated even if you control no monsters, as technically "all monsters you control" are Yosenju monsters if there are none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Vanity's Emptiness (x1)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
    *   **Strategy:** Another "floodgate" card that is abused in Yosenju due to the deck's lack of special summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Bottomless Trap Hole (x1)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>
    *   **Strategy:** Essential removal.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device (x1)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
    *   **Strategy:** Essential removal.
*   **Mirror Force (x2)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>
    *   **Strategy:** Good defensive measure because the Yosenju field is usually empty on the opponent's turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

The cloning glitch in Minecraft Pocket Edition (PE) allows players to duplicate items, providing unlimited access to valuable resources like diamonds and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This glitch can be used to acquire any desired item in large quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

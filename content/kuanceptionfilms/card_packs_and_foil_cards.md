## Value Cube Unboxing: Gravekeeper Structure Deck

The video features the unboxing of a Yu-Gi-Oh! value cube purchased from Target, which includes a Gravekeeper structure deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The product packaging suggests it contains 25 cards, 2 [[booster_pack_and_promo_cards | booster packs]], and 5 [[foil_cards_and_mystery_unveiling | foil cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## Unboxing Evaluation

The unboxing was deemed worthwhile, primarily due to the Gravekeeper's deck being "pretty pricey on the secondary market today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. The value cube was purchased for $9.99, making the overall haul a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

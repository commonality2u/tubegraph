The [[Yosenju budget deck strategies | Yosenju budget deck]] is presented as a cost-effective option in Yu-Gi-Oh!, potentially built for under $40, or even under $30 if the extra deck is disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is considered one of the best [[Budget Decks in YuGiOh | budget decks]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> and is viable for local play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Core Deck Building Philosophy

The primary strategy of this deck revolves around [[Normal summoning tactics in Yosenju deck | normal summoning]] [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju cards]] to spam the field, rather than special summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This focus on normal summoning makes certain traditional support cards more effective and reduces the need for an expensive extra deck.

### Main Deck Card Options

The main deck utilizes various [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju monsters]] and essential spell and [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap cards]] to facilitate its strategy and provide defense.

#### Monsters

*   **Yosenju Kama 1 (x3):** This card allows you to return any face-up card your opponent controls to their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It also helps with [[Normal summoning tactics in Yosenju deck | normal summoning]] additional [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, acting as both an automatic Compulsion and a double summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Kama 2 (x3):** Enables direct attacks for half damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and also grants an additional [[Normal summoning tactics in Yosenju deck | normal summon]] for another [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Kama 3 (x3):** This card is highly effective when combined with Kama 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. If another [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju card]] deals damage, Kama 3 allows you to search a [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju card]] from your deck to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This can lead to another [[Normal summoning tactics in Yosenju deck | normal summon]] or allow you to search for Yosenju Tsujik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Tsujik (x3):** Functions similarly to "Honest" and "Gorz the Emissary of Darkness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Its first effect allows you to discard it during the damage step to give a [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju card]] on your field 1000 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The second effect, if it's normal summoned, lets you target a [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju card]] on the field to gain 1000 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Shinchu L (x2):** The only pendulum card in this specific build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. It protects [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju monsters]] from destruction by battle or card effect by destroying itself instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. It's especially useful for [[Defensive and offensive tactics in Yosenju deck | defensive measures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> and creates an "OP" combo with Yosenju Secret Move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Card Car D (x3):** Provides excellent draw power, which is crucial for the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. With traps set, it allows the player to defend themselves even without other monsters on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

#### Spell Cards

*   **Fire Formation - Tenki (x1):** A continuous spell that offers draw power by allowing you to search your deck for a [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju monster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. It also provides a 100 ATK boost to all Beast-Warrior monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Dimensional Fissure (x1):** A "floodgate" card that banishes any monster sent to the graveyard instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It works well with [[Yosenju budget deck strategies | Yosenju]] because the deck rarely sends its own monsters to the graveyard or relies on graveyard recursion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Effective against decks like Shadolls and Heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Book of Moon (x1):** An essential card for any deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon (x2):** An essential card for back row removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Pot of Duality (x3):** Highly effective in this deck because it doesn't rely on special summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. It allows you to excavate the top three cards of your deck, add one to your hand, though you cannot special summon for the rest of the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This restriction is largely irrelevant for [[Yosenju budget deck strategies | Yosenju]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Upstart Goblin (x1):** Provides great draw power, which is needed due to the low monster count in the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Dark Hole (x2):** Preferred over Raigeki because [[Yosenju budget deck strategies | Yosenju]] monsters typically return to the hand at the end of the turn, leaving the field clear on the opponent's turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

#### Trap Cards

*   **Yosenju Secret Move (x3):** Negates and destroys spell/trap or monster effects while you control at least one [[Yosenju deck composition and cards | Yosenju card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It has an "OP" synergy with Shinchu L, as it can still activate even if Shinchu L is the only "Yosenju monster" (as a pendulum card) and no actual monsters are on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Vanity's Emptiness (x1):** Another floodgate that works well since the deck doesn't special summon often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Bottomless Trap Hole (x1):** An essential [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device (x1):** An essential [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Mirror Force (x2):** A good [[Defensive and offensive tactics in Yosenju deck | defensive measure]] since the field is often clear of monsters on the opponent's turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   **Lightning Chidori (x1):** A powerful rank 4 XYZ monster that can return cards to the opponent's deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. It is highlighted as an "expensive card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King (x1):** Useful for searching out "Tenki" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon (x1):** Provides strong offensive power when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Number 101: Silent Honor ARK (x1):** An essential rank 4 XYZ monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer (x1):** Another essential and versatile rank 4 XYZ monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Gagaga Cowboy (x1):** Considered the best rank 4 for the deck due to its versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. It can gain ATK in attack position or deal 800 direct damage in defense position, which can be crucial for winning games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

The unboxing of a Yu-Gi-Oh Star Pack 2013 booster box reveals insights into the perceived [[Value and Rarity of Yugioh Cards | rarity]] and playability of the cards found within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The box contains 50 packs, with three cards in each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Card Rarity and Desirability

The overall [[Fermenting YuGiOh decks for rarity | rarity]] of cards from the Star Pack 2013 set is noted, with the unboxer stating there "aren't too many good reprints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Despite this, the visual appeal of "shiny" cards is highlighted as "perfection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Cards are sorted into piles for "foils" and "comets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, indicating different levels of [[card_types_and_rarities_like_secret_rare_and_promo_cards | rarity]] or finish.

Specific cards identified as foils include:
*   Zubaba Knight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   Elemental Hero Escuridao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, which the unboxer was actively [[chasing_rare_yugioh_cards | looking for]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. A second copy of this card was also pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

A second copy was also pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

*   Seven Swords Warrior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, deemed "pretty cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Card Playability and Utility

Beyond rarity, the practical use of cards in gameplay is a frequent point of commentary. This [[discussion_of_card_features_and_deck_compatibility | discussion of card features and deck compatibility]] provides insights into their value for deck building:

*   **Goblin Burg:** Described as "pretty useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> and "pretty good card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. It works well with "Mass Heroes" in an Elemental Hero deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> and is useful for "Xyz summoning Level 4" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> or "Rank 4 Xyz" monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Elemental Hero Escuridao:** Has a "really nice effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Arcana Force XIV - The Dark Ruler:** Labelled a "pretty crap hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Baby Tiragon:** Also considered a "pretty crap hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> and later described as "garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Faith Bird:** Initially desired ("frick I actually wanted this card") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, but later considered "probably the best card out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

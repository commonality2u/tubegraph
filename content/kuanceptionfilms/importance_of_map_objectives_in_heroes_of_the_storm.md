Map objectives in Heroes of the Storm are crucial elements that can dictate the flow of a match and contribute significantly to victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00"></a>. These objectives often serve as focal points for team engagements and strategic decisions.

## Immortals on Battlefield of Eternity

On the Battlefield of Eternity map, the primary objective involves battling Immortals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45"></a>. Players frequently engage in fights to secure their team's Immortal while attempting to damage or defeat the enemy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12"></a>. Capturing these Immortals grants significant advantages, as they will push down lanes and attack enemy structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08"></a>. Securing multiple Immortals contributes to a team's push and overall progress towards the enemy core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12"></a>.

## Strategic Priority of Objectives

While individual [[gameplay_strategies_for_playing_as_murky_in_heroes_of_the_storm | Murky]] players might focus heavily on pushing lanes and accumulating [[tips_for_improving_strategy_and_siege_damage_with_murky | siege damage]], contributing to objectives is also a recognized aspect of gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00"></a>. A player's [[gameplay_strategies_for_playing_as_murky_in_heroes_of_the_storm | Murky]] playstyle might be "a little bit objective but mostly pushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08"></a>. However, ignoring the Immortal when it's nearby or when the team needs assistance can be a strategic misstep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54"></a>. Losing an Immortal to the opposing team is considered a "bad sign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41"></a>, as it directly aids the enemy's advance.

Team fights frequently erupt around map objectives, with players engaging to secure control or disrupt the enemy's attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10"></a>. An effective strategy involves focusing on the enemy's objective while ensuring that one's own objective is not left undefended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04"></a>. Ultimately, attacking the enemy Immortal is often considered the "main objective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11"></a>.

## Player Perspectives on Objectives

Some players, particularly those specializing in [[gameplay_strategies_for_playing_as_murky_in_heroes_of_the_storm | Murky]], may prioritize pushing lanes over actively participating in every objective fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17"></a>. This can sometimes lead to teammates expressing frustration, as their role in the game is primarily seen as a pusher who "only die[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31"></a>. However, satisfying the condition of securing a fort while also contributing to objectives, such as by participating in the Immortal fight, is key to overall success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17"></a>.

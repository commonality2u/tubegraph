This article details a [[video_game_commentary | gameplay commentary]] session of the Gun Game mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 on PC.

## Initial Release and PC Optimization
The game was released recently, with many players enjoying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, the PC version presented a learning curve and issues with optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The commentator expressed hope for these issues to be resolved in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

In contrast, the PlayStation 4 version of the game was noted to be running very well and was fun to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Black Ops 3 was released for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PC, and last-generation consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The commentator strongly advised against purchasing the game on last-gen consoles like the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, deeming it not a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## PC Gameplay Experience
The commentator, typically a PlayStation 3 player without a PlayStation 4 at the time, was playing on the PC version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. They admitted to struggling a bit on PC, noting that the PC platform has a highly competitive player base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

A significant challenge was finding a match, with the commentator spending five minutes searching for a game while recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The video included a jump cut to the gameplay once a match was finally found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### In-Game Performance & Technical Glitches
The game began on the "Breach" map, which the commentator had not played before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Despite admitting to being a "scuffed" player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, they achieved a respectable 5-1 score early in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

Throughout the session, the commentator encountered noticeable frame drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, especially one particularly "terrible" instance that occurred while getting a kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. They also apologized for their sound quality, mentioning it was 12 AM and they were working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Gun Game Dynamics
In Gun Game, the player's weapon automatically changes upon getting a kill. During the match, the commentator used various weapons, including:
*   A shotgun that initially caused hit markers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> but eventually secured a kill on the third shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   A subsequent shotgun that was difficult to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   A fully automatic shotgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   A more difficult gun later in the match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

The commentator demonstrated different tactics, including a "camping tactic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The game ultimately ended with a fist kill on an AFK (away from keyboard) player, securing the win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Conclusion
Despite the "shitty" state of the PC version of Black Ops 3 at the time, the Gun Game mode was considered fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

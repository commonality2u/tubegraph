Discussions around [[challenges_faced_during_gameplay | gaming performance]] and technical issues frequently arise among players, covering aspects from visual glitches and lag to difficulties with scoring and complex gameplay mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Performance Issues

Players sometimes experience their game "bugging out" or being "laggy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. One player noted their game was "really wide," possibly indicating a display issue or unresponsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Another instance mentioned the game "wagon really bad" with no clear reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. There were also questions about why the game was "working" for some players but "bugging out" for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Gameplay Difficulties

Specific gameplay elements can present [[challenges_faced_during_gameplay | difficulties]]:
*   **Missing Jumps:** Players reported missing "all of the jump" elements in a song, or even "not even jumped" but other kinds of notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Hard Songs:** There's a strategy of playing a "really hard song" to "beat" others or to achieve a certain ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. One player mentioned that a song had "crossmap jumps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Accuracy
Accuracy is a key metric in rhythm games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Players often discuss their current accuracy, such as 92% or 83% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Missing "all of the jump" notes significantly impacts accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Scoring and Ranking
Issues with scoring and ranking systems are also a topic of [[gaming_discussions | discussion]]:
*   **Score Visibility:** One player couldn't see all of their score details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Point Caps:** There was a mention that "you can't get over 1 million points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Ranking System Logic:** Players debated the terminology for rank changes, discussing whether "plus rank" means "going down" or "going up," and the implications of "minus" rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It was proposed that "going up in rank" means moving "to one" on a ladder, while "minus" means "falling down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Performance Points (PP):** A player recalled that "a thousand PP" used to correlate with a rank of "70k," but now it relates to "113k," indicating a change in the ranking system or point accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Score Comparisons:** Players compare their scores, with one feeling "so bad with 39k" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

    <div class="callout-content">
        <p>A specific technical interaction discussed was the "skip button," with a player asserting their literal identity as a "kappa" (a Twitch emote often associated with sarcasm or irony) when interacting with the skip button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Another mentioned their "Kappa doesn't spin" but "spins me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.</p>

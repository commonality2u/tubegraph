The [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC community]] of *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* faces a significant problem with weapon balance, particularly concerning the overuse of specific sniper rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Problem

A prevalent issue observed on the [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC platform]] is that a vast majority of players exclusively use the Drakon and P06 sniper rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It is reported that in almost every lobby, three-fourths of the players are "spamming" these weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The Brecci shotgun is also noted for being overused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

While sniper rifles can be satisfying and effective in *Call of Duty* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, their widespread dominance on PC creates a repetitive and unenjoyable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Players desire variety and fun, not predictability where they are constantly shot from all angles by Drakon and P06 users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This imbalance leads to a "mess of sniper rifles and shotguns" on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Comparison to Console
On [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | console platforms]], weapon balance is generally considered "on point" and effective, with sniper rifles not perceived as a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, this balance does not translate to the PC, where snipers "overpopulate" and "oversaturate" the game with spam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

The root of this imbalance is attributed to the fact that these weapons were optimized for console player usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Proposed Solution
To address this, it is strongly suggested that Treyarch implement [[need_for_dedicated_pc_weapon_balancing_in_black_ops_3 | dedicated PC weapon balancing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This would involve establishing dedicated weapon stats specifically for the [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Such a change would allow the game to remain enjoyable for PC players without requiring them to constantly face the same limited set of overpowered weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

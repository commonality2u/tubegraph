Opening YuGiOh booster packs is a common way for collectors to pursue rare and valuable cards. The challenge lies in the random nature of pulls, with collectors often targeting specific, highly sought-after cards within a set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Hunt for Rarity

In one such [[collecting_ultra_rare_yugioh_cards | collecting endeavor]], 24 packs of Star Pack Arc V were opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Each pack contained only three cards, meaning that luck plays a significant role in obtaining desired items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The primary target for this opening was the Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Key Targets and Desired Cards

Beyond the main objective, other cards were also considered valuable pulls:
*   **Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon** The most coveted card in the set, consistently sought after throughout the opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Constellar Pleiades** Considered "one of the best cards in the set" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> and "very good to get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. It was noted as generally "pretty hard to pull nowadays" outside of Star Pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon** Also considered a good pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Mobius the Mega Monarch** Initially deemed "pretty cool to get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Common cards like Stargazer Magician, Timegazer Magician, Performapal Trampulyn, and Polymerization were frequently pulled, forming the bulk of the opened packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## The Outcome of the Pulls

Despite the intensive search across 24 packs, the highly sought-after Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon was not obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

The most notable pulls included:
*   Two Constellar Pleiades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   One Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   One Mobius the Mega Monarch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

While the Constellar Pleiades pulls were initially seen as positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, the overall assessment of luck was ultimately deemed "not that lucky" given the specific source of the cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

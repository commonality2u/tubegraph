The Classic Playlist in *Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare* offers players the option to experience the game without the signature Exo Suit movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This feature was introduced to cater to players who preferred the traditional ground-based movement mechanics found in earlier *Call of Duty* titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Gameplay Experience

In the Classic Playlist, players are unable to perform advanced Exo Suit maneuvers such as boost jumping or double jumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Despite the removal of these specific verticality elements, players can still utilize other EXO abilities and carry out all standard *Call of Duty* functions, including running and engaging in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Player Preferences

The inclusion of the Classic Playlist acknowledges that many players did not favor the increased verticality introduced by Sledgehammer Games in *Advanced Warfare* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. While some players, including the commentator, appreciated the fast-paced and unique nature that Exo Suit movements brought to the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, a significant portion of the player base preferred a return to more limited, ground-based movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Personal Preference
> The commentator expresses a personal preference for the *Advanced Warfare*'s movement, stating that the Exo Suit movements are what make the game special and unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. However, they acknowledge the validity of players who prefer the limited movements of the Classic Playlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.

The option to play without Exo Suit movements is considered a "very interesting and cool" addition to the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. The commentator also speculates on future *Call of Duty* titles, suggesting that subsequent Treyarch games, such as *Black Ops 3*, might not feature the same level of verticality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

When comparing Call of Duty gameplay experiences across different platforms, significant differences, particularly regarding optimization and performance, become apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The developer notes that the Black Ops 3 beta highlighted distinct experiences between console and PC players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Gameplay Experience Differences
The developer, primarily a console Call of Duty player, found it challenging to adapt to the Black Ops 3 PC beta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Console Experience
Playing the Black Ops 3 beta on PlayStation 4 was described as "amazing," with the developer performing well despite not being a regular PS4 player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This suggests a smoother, more enjoyable experience on console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### PC Experience
[[pros_and_cons_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | Playing Black Ops 3 on PC]] presented several issues:
*   **Performance and Optimization** The game ran "terribly" even on a 750 Ti graphics card, which was not considered outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   While frame rates could be consistent when recording with Fraps, there were frequent "huge drops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   The game did not feel "very optimized" for PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   "Game breaking lag" was a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Challenges for PC Players** [[player_base_issues_for_call_of_duty_games_on_pc | PC players]] without high-end "killer machines" are likely to experience lag and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Technical Glitches** A friend downloaded the beta but couldn't get the game to work or connect to servers, indicating further PC-specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Historical PC Optimization in Call of Duty
Despite Call of Duty games historically being exclusive to PC, recent titles have shown poor optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>:
*   [[modern_warfare_3_gameplay | Modern Warfare 3]] and Black Ops 2 "felt all right" on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Black Ops 1 and Ghosts were considered "complete [\h__\h]" in terms of PC optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   The Black Ops 3 beta continued this trend, not looking "ideal" or "very good" on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Player Perspective
The developer expressed hope that the optimization issues for the PC version of Black Ops 3 were exclusive to the beta and would be resolved upon full release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Despite the performance problems, the developer found the game "really fun" on consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Treyarch was praised for the "amazing audio quality" in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

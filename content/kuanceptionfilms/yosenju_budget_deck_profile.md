This article provides a detailed profile of a [[yugioh_budget_deck_building | Yosenju budget deck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The deck can be built for under $40, and possibly under $30 if the [[extra_deck_cards_for_yosenju | Extra Deck]] is disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Yosenju is considered one of the best [[yugioh_budget_deck_building | budget decks]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It functions as an "anti-meta" deck, often capable of dealing significant damage to Tier 1 decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Core Strategy

The primary strategy of this Yosenju build is to spam [[key_yosenju_card_strategies | normal summoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Unlike many decks, special summoning is not a focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Yosenju monsters return to the hand at the end of the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Monster Cards

*   **Yosenju Kama 1** (3 copies): Returns any face-up card your opponent controls to their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Allows for an additional [[key_yosenju_card_strategies | normal summon]] of another Yosenju card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Kama 2** (3 copies): Can attack the opponent directly for half damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Also allows for an additional [[key_yosenju_card_strategies | normal summon]] of another Yosenju card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Kama 3** (3 copies): When another Yosenju card deals damage to your opponent, you can search a Yosenju card from your deck and add it to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This effect is powerful when comboed with Kama 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, as it can lead to another [[key_yosenju_card_strategies | normal summon]] or allow you to search for Suijin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Tsujik** (3 copies):
    *   **First effect**: Discard this card during the damage step to give a Yosenju monster 1000 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   **Second effect**: If normal summoned, target one Yosenju card on the field to have it gain 1000 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Yosenju Shinchu L** (2 copies): The only Pendulum card in this build, which is not a Pendulum-focused Yosenju deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. As a Pendulum card, it can be destroyed instead of a Yosenju monster you control that would be destroyed by battle or card effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This card is especially powerful when combined with Yosenju Secret Move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Cardcar D** (3 copies): Provides excellent draw power for the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. With [[recommended_spells_and_traps_for_yosenju_deck | traps]] set, it's possible to defend yourself even with an empty field after its effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Spell Cards

*   **Fire Formation - Tenki** (3 copies): A continuous spell that allows you to search your deck for a Yosenju monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. All Beast-Warrior monsters also gain 100 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Dimensional Fissure** (2 copies): A floodgate spell that banishes any monster sent to the graveyard instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This card is highly effective in Yosenju decks because the deck rarely sends monsters to the graveyard and does not rely on graveyard recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. It is good against decks like Shaddolls and Heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Book of Moon** (2 copies): Considered an essential card for any deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon (MST)** (2 copies): An essential card for backrow removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Pot of Duality** (3 copies): This card is "abused" in this deck because Yosenju does not special summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. It allows you to excavate the top three cards of your deck, choose one to add to your hand, though you cannot special summon for the rest of the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This restriction is irrelevant for Yosenju <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Upstart Goblin** (1 copy): Provides great draw power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, which is crucial for a deck with few monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Dark Hole** (2 copies): Included instead of Raigeki because Yosenju monsters return to the hand at the end of the turn, so your field is often clear on the opponent's turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Trap Cards

*   **Yosenju Secret Move** (3 copies): If a spell/trap card or monster effect is activated while you control at least one Yosenju monster (or if all face-up monsters you control are Yosenju monsters), it negates the activation and destroys the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. It's particularly effective with Shinchu L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Vanity's Emptiness** (2 copies): Another floodgate trap that is abused in this deck because Yosenju typically does not special summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Bottomless Trap Hole** (1 copy): An essential trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device** (1 copy): An essential trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Mirror Force** (2 copies): A good defensive measure to have, especially since the field is often empty on the opponent's turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Extra Deck Considerations

The [[extra_deck_cards_for_yosenju | Extra Deck]] can significantly increase the cost of the deck due to expensive cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The deck typically doesn't special summon, so the [[extra_deck_cards_for_yosenju | Extra Deck]] is not central to its strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

*   **Lightning Chidori** (1 copy): An expensive Rank 4 Xyz monster (requiring two Level 4 Wind monsters) that can send cards back to the opponent's deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King** (1 copy): Good for searching Fire Formation - Tenki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon** (1 copy): Provides strong offensive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Number 101: Silent Honor ARK** (1 copy): An essential Rank 4 Xyz monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer** (1 copy): Another essential Rank 4 Xyz monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Cowboy** (1 copy): Considered one of the best Rank 4 Xyz monsters for this deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. It can gain ATK in attack position or deal 800 damage directly to the opponent in defense position, which can be crucial for winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Yosenju is a viable and fun-to-play [[yugioh_budget_deck_building | budget deck]] for local play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

Gaming culture often involves shared experiences, terminology, and [[video_game_commentary | commentary]] among players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This extends to playing specific game modes like "Team Deathmatch" in titles such as *Modern Warfare 3* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The presence of others, even in the background, can contribute to the social aspect of gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Shared Terminology and [[video_game_commentary | Commentary]]

Players frequently use specialized jargon to describe in-game situations and other players. Examples from the community include:
*   Calling others "gappers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Referring to specific weapon types or playstyles as "Noob tubes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Describing players who stay in one location as "camper[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   Celebrating multi-kills with terms like "double," "triple," and "quad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

[[video_game_commentary | Video game commentary]] often includes immediate [[reaction_to_video_games | reactions to gameplay]] events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, such as expressing frustration at an opponent's poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> or taunting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Players might also acknowledge in-game achievements, like becoming "The Rescuer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

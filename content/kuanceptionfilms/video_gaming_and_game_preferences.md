### In-Game Mechanics and Valuables
A discussion occurs regarding in-game cards, which are described as "completely worthless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. These cards are said to have no monetary value, cannot be sold, played on the field, or stacked with other cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, effectively only benefiting the opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Character Deep Dive: Gangplank
The character Gangplank from [[gaming_as_entertainment | League of Legends]] is described as the "uncrowned king" of Bilgewater, reigning through "fear, violence, and your spine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. His abilities include firing a pistol shot that deals damage, can critically strike "like a Harley," and applies on-hit effects such as "red buff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

This article details the contents and pulls from a specific Yu-Gi-Oh! [[yugioh_value_cube_openings | value cube opening]] from Target, focusing on the various packs included and their perceived value. The video features an [[target_blister_packs_unboxing | unboxing]] of a [[yugioh_value_cube_contents_and_value | value cube]] that includes a Gravekeeper's Structure Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Value Cube Contents: Claims vs. Reality

The packaging of this particular [[yugioh_value_cube_contents | Yu-Gi-Oh! value cube]] states it contains 25 cards, 2 boosters, and 5 foil cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, this information is described as "pretty misleading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The Gravekeeper's structure deck alone contains 40 cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The [[yugioh_value_cube_contents | value cube]] typically contains:
*   A structure deck (e.g., Gravekeeper's Structure Deck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Two booster packs (e.g., *Return of the Duelist*, *Hidden Arsenal 4*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   A foil promo pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

## Pack Openings and Card Pulls

### [[foil_and_promo_cards_in_value_cube | Foil Pack]]
The [[foil_and_promo_cards_in_value_cube | foil pack]] contained a "platinum rare" Gishki Zielgigas, a Bujingi Crane, and an Armored Kappa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The Bujingi Crane artwork was particularly liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### *Return of the Duelist* Booster Pack
This pack was hoped to yield a "dankest pull" like Champion Excalibur ultimate rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
Cards pulled included:
*   Shu Bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   Dust Knight (artwork described as "pretty cool") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>
*   Xyz Soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>

### *Hidden Arsenal 4* Booster Pack
The *Hidden Arsenal 4* pack was hoped to pull a Trishula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, but did not.
Cards pulled included:
*   Genex Ally Powercell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Sacred Spirit of the Ice Barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> (Ice Barrier cards were noted for their "dank" appearance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>

A foil card pulled (its origin pack not specified, but possibly a separate promo):
*   Ready for Intercepting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This card's effect (target a warrior or spellcaster, change to face-down defense) was deemed inferior to Book of Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Gravekeeper's Structure Deck
The Gravekeeper's Structure Deck was highlighted as having "dank cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> and being "pretty pricey on the secondary market today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Notable cards from the Gravekeeper's Structure Deck:
*   Lava Golem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
*   Mystical Beast of Serket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
*   Temple of the Kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> (noted for previously being banned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Mystic Tomato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> (still good) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   Gravekeeper's Spy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> (very good common) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   Gravekeeper's Assailant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Gravekeeper's Descendant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> (good to pull) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
*   Creature Swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>
*   Book of Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> (amazing card) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>
*   Foolish Burial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   Mirror Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
*   Malevolent Catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
*   Mystical Space Typhoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
*   Necrovalley (x2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>

## Value Assessment
The overall [[yugioh_value_cube_contents_and_value | value cube opening]] was considered "worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> due to the Gravekeeper's deck being "pretty pricey on the secondary market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, especially since the box was purchased for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The "dank Commons" pulled also contributed to the perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

The Trap Tricks 2015 December Deck Profile heavily relies on draw power engines to achieve its objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The primary goal is to quickly draw "Trick" cards to enable fast deployment of Rank 4 and Rank 5 Xyz monsters, while also establishing a strong back-row defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Key Draw Power Engines

Several cards function as essential draw power engines within the deck:

### Chicken Game
"Chicken Game" is an excellent draw power mechanic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Terraforming**: Three copies of "Terraforming" are included to search for "Chicken Game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Pseudo Space**: Two copies of "Pseudo Space" are used to act as additional copies of "Chicken Game," leveraging the presence of three "Terraforming" cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Upstart Goblin
Three copies of "Upstart Goblin" are considered standard in the format for maximum consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Pot of Duality
"Pot of Duality" also contributes to the deck's draw power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

By combining these draw power engines, the deck aims to consistently access its core "Trick" cards and facilitate its [[Game mechanics and controls | gameplay mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

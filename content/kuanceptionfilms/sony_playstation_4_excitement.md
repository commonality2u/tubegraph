Excitement for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) significantly intensified during [[E3 2015 gaming event | E3 2015]], with one commentator stating that Sony "won" the event in less than a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

The widespread positive reception for Sony's presentation at [[E3 2015 gaming event | E3 2015]] was largely fueled by major announcements, particularly the reveal that a [[Final Fantasy VII remake announcement | Final Fantasy VII remake]] is "happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This specific news was described as a "very special treat for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The overwhelming response led to the sentiment that "basically everybody in the known universe" would now be acquiring a PlayStation 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This perceived dominance also resulted in a dismissive attitude towards the Xbox One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

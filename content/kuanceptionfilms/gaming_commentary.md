*   **Observations and Questions:** Players may pose questions about game mechanics or visual elements, like "why am I floating?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> or "why is it slow now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Commentary can include lighthearted observations about unusual game physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> or humorous descriptions of character states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Interaction with Game Elements:** Commentators describe their attempts to interact with the game world, whether trying to make a character turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, connect with other in-game entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, or navigate obstacles like ladders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Expressing Difficulty or Dislike:** Players may express frustration when missing actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> or convey negative sentiments about certain game areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

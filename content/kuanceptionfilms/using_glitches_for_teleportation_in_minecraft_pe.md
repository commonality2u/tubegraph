Players of [[minecraft_pocket_edition_080_update_features | Minecraft Pocket Edition]] on iOS can utilize specific glitches to achieve teleportation within the game world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These glitches can provide quick movement options, resembling an elevator, or offer strategic advantages in survival situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## The Tower Teleportation Glitch

This glitch allows players to instantly teleport from the base of a specially constructed tower to its top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It can serve as a quick "elevator" or a means to escape danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Materials Needed
To perform this glitch, players will need:
*   A wooden door or a trap door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   Building materials such as cobblestone or wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>

### Instructions
1.  **Build a Tower:** Construct a straight tower with a central "pole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
2.  **Place the Door:** Position a wooden door or trap door directly underneath the tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
3.  **Enter the Door:** Walk up to the door and close it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. The player should become stuck inside the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
4.  **Exit and Re-enter Game:** While stuck, close out of the game application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
5.  **Teleport:** Re-open the game. The player should now appear on top of the tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Practical Applications
This glitch provides unique advantages for [[building_a_tower_with_a_glitch | tower construction]] and survival:
*   **Elevator Functionality:** It acts as an instant elevator, allowing quick ascent to the top of a structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Quick Escape/Fortress:** If attacked by zombies, a player can quickly build a door, place it down, and use the glitch to teleport to safety at the top of a quickly erected structure, effectively creating a "little Fortress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This can be useful even without a bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

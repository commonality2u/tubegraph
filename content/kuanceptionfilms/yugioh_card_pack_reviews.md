A [[yugioh_value_box_opening | YuGiOh Value Cube]] is opened, revealing its contents and assessing its value, highlighting the included cards and booster packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Product Description and Purchase Details

The Value Cube is advertised as containing 25 cards, two booster packs, and five foil cards in every pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, the actual contents include a 40-card deck in addition to the stated items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

This specific Value Cube came with a Fairy Structure Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It was purchased for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The Fairy Structure Deck alone is noted to be more expensive online due to its lack of reprints, making the Value Cube a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The purchase was made at [[yugioh_card_opening_at_target | Target]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Unboxing Experience

Upon opening, the box contained styrofoam filler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The main contents included the Fairy Structure Deck and a promo pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. An additional pack, "Judgment of the Light," was found smashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Another pack, "Return of the Duels," was also included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. A "Lost Chapter of the Noble Knights" item, appearing to be a structure deck, was also present and set aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Opening the Fairy Structure Deck packaging was notably difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Overall Impression

Despite the weak pulls from the individual booster packs, the [[yugioh_value_box_opening | Value Cube]] is considered a good deal due to the guaranteed structure deck and promo pack contents, especially since the $9.99 price point is comparable to a standalone structure deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

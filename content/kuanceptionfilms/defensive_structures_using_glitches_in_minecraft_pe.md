Minecraft Pocket Edition offers glitches that can be utilized to create defensive structures, such as a teleportation fortress. These methods allow players to quickly gain a height advantage, providing safety from ground-level threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Building a Teleportation Fortress

This glitch allows players to [[using_glitches_for_teleportation_in_minecraft_pe | teleport instantly to the top of a tower]], effectively creating a quick escape or vantage point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Required Materials
*   A wooden door or trap door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   [[building_a_tower_with_a_glitch | Building material]] such as cobblestone or wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>

### Steps to Create and Use
1.  **Construct a Tower**: Build a tower that is "exactly straight" with a "pole straight down the middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
2.  **Place the Door**: Put a door directly underneath the constructed tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Teleportation**:
    *   Walk up to the door and close it, which should cause the player to become stuck inside the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    *   Once stuck, close out of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   Reopen the game, and the player should appear on top of the tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Defensive Applications
This glitch can be used to:
*   Create an "elevator" for quick ascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Escape from threats like zombies; by quickly building a door and performing the glitch, players can [[ingame_strategies_and_tactics | teleport to safety]] on top of a makeshift "fortress" if they lack a bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The PC player base for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is experiencing a significant [[black_ops_3_weapon_balance_issues_on_pc | weapon balance problem]] that needs addressing by Treyarch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The issue stems from a lack of [[differences_between_pc_and_console_weapon_optimization | dedicated weapon balancing]] for the [[pc_versus_console_gameplay_performance | PC platform]], leading to a monotonous and frustrating gameplay experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Dominance of Specific Weapons on PC

On [[challenges_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | Black Ops 3 on PC]], nearly every player exclusively uses the Drakon and P-06 sniper rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It's common to find lobbies where three-fourths of players are spamming these weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While sniper rifles can be satisfying and good for Call of Duty games, their pervasive use on PC indicates a clear [[black_ops_3_weapon_balance_issues_on_pc | weapon balance problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The Brecci shotgun is also noted as being overused on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

This overpopulation of snipers and shotguns creates a situation where players don't want to play "Call of Duty: Combine," "Call of Duty: Drakon," or "Call of Duty: P-06," but rather the full Black Ops 3 experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Players desire variety and the ability to have fun without knowing exactly what to expect from every game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Contrast with Console Weapon Balance

In contrast, on [[comparison_of_pc_and_console_versions | console]], the [[comparison_of_pc_and_console_versions | weapon balance is on point]] and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Many console players perceive sniper rifles as balanced and not a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Root Cause: Console-Optimized Weapons on PC

The reason these particular guns are so problematic on [[pc_versus_console_gameplay_performance | PC]] is because they were [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | optimized for console player usage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. When a company promotes its game and implicitly promotes certain weapons by giving them superior stats, it creates an imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Proposed Solution: Dedicated PC Weapon Optimization

To remedy this, Treyarch should implement [[differences_between_pc_and_console_weapon_optimization | dedicated weapon balancing]] specifically for the [[pc_versus_console_gameplay_performance | PC community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This means having unique [[differences_between_pc_and_console_weapon_optimization | weapon stats]] adjusted for the PC environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This is presented as a simple concept that should not be difficult for developers to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

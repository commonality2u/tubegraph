The gameplay video opens with an introduction to **Blade and Soul**, a new MMORPG that has been out for "a little bit over a week" and already boasts "millions of players registered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, being described as "the new thing" and "so hot right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The host, "Victor of Kwan ception films," aims to create a new character and play with "Rice Expert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, though concerns are raised about potentially long queue times, humorously exaggerated as "a little bit over five billion hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## [[character_creation_and_customization_in_blade_and_soul | Character Creation]]
The [[character_creation_and_customization_in_blade_and_soul | character creation process]] in **Blade and Soul** offers several class choices including Assassin, Blade Master, and Kung Fu Master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The player opts for the Blade Master class, perceiving it as "the least difficult to play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The character chosen is a "mainstream Jen female Blade Master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The [[character_creation_and_customization_in_blade_and_soul | customization options]] are extensive, allowing for adjustments to:
*   Hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
*   Facial types and decorations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   Body type and height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   Hair color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   Lip gloss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>

A notable feature is the "jiggle physics," which is said to be quite prominent, with the intensity being impacted by the player's computer specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Humorous observations from "Rice Expert" include the suggestion of a "30% stats boost" (strength and agility) for choosing a black character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The character is ultimately named "Conception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## [[gameplay_commentary_and_first_impressions | First Impressions of Gameplay]]
Upon starting the game, the initial impression is positive. The player notes the game's intuitiveness, particularly the map system which makes it easy to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The combat system and character movement are highlighted:
*   **Sprint and Combos**: The sprint ability is described as "Opie" (overpowered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> and the combos are "intense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Glide Ability**: The character quickly learns a "glide" ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Training and XP**: Early gameplay involves training dummies to gain experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, with observations about the XP bar not moving after some kills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Visuals**: Despite playing on "the lowest graphic possible" with an 800x600 window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, the water graphics are commended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Camera Control**: The ability to change the camera view by scrolling is noted as "very intuitive" and "nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Early Challenges and Observations
An early challenge encountered is dying by jumping off a cliff, leading to a humorous self-assessment of "MLG Optic" skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. The initial cinematic features a "raining cutscene" and shows the character's body floating in the ocean, setting up a "legendary man" narrative typical of MMOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Combat against training dummies and early enemies is demonstrated, with the player expressing that the combat is "very exciting" but also humorously calling it "complete trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. There is curiosity about the quality of PvP (Player vs Player) in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

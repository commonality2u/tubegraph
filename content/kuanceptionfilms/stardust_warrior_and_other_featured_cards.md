The *Synchron Extreme* Japanese Structure Deck is a Yu-Gi-Oh! product that was not available in the U.S.A. at the time of its review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This deck is available in Japanese and Korean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It comes with a playmat featuring the *Synchron Extreme* cover artwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> and a player manual guide for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. A promotional packet is also included, teaching good card combos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Unlike U.S. structure decks, Japanese structure decks come in plastic holders instead of regular packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Deck Contents and Rarities

Each *Synchron Extreme* Structure Deck contains 44 cards in total, with four cards designated for the Extra Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The rarity distribution for the cards is as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>:

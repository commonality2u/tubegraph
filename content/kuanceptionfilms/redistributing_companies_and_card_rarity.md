Redistributing companies play a role in packaging and distributing trading card products, often creating unique bundles that include various card types and booster packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These companies are seen as providing "favors" by making such combinations available to collectors and players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Blister Pack Contents

An example of such a product is a "DAT" blister pack, which includes:
*   40 card sleeves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   One booster pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Two foil [[card_types_and_rarities_like_secret_rare_and_promo_cards | promo cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

The booster pack in one instance was identified as a "Judgment of the Light" pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Card Pulls and Rarity

The contents pulled from such a blister pack can include a mix of [[value_and_rarity_of_yugioh_cards | rarities]] and highly sought-after cards:

### Booster Pack Pulls
From the "Judgment of the Light" booster pack, a "Mecha Phantom Beast" card was pulled, identified as a [[rare_and_super_rare_card_pulls | rare]] card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Promo Card Pulls
The two foil [[card_types_and_rarities_like_secret_rare_and_promo_cards | promo cards]] included in the blister pack were:
*   **Dark Hole** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   **Instant Fusion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
    *   "Instant Fusion" was highlighted as one of the "best [[card_types_and_rarities_like_secret_rare_and_promo_cards | promo cards]]" that could be acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Its value is noted for its utility in building "rank four decks" and for synergy with cards like "Norden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

These bundles, facilitated by redistributing companies, provide access to specific [[card_types_and_rarities_like_secret_rare_and_promo_cards | promo cards]] that can be strategically beneficial for deck building, in addition to the variable [[value_and_rarity_of_yugioh_cards | rarity]] of cards found in booster packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

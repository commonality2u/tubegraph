*   **Solemn Warning** (x1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>
    *   Negates the summoning of any monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.
*   **Nightmare Wheel** (x2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>
    *   Preferred over Fiendish Chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. It prevents the opponent's monster from attacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a> and inflicts 500 damage to the opponent on each of your Standby Phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, contributing to the "burn" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

    *   Included for obvious reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
*   **Scrap-Iron Scarecrow** (x1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>
    *   A trolly card that can be reset face-down instead of being sent to the graveyard after use, providing continuous defensive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
*   **Magic Cylinder** (x1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>

*   **Wall of Disruption** (x1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>

Example: If an opponent has three attack position monsters and one attacks, all three lose 2400 ATK (800 x 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. A powerful alternative to Mirror Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device** (x1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>

*   **Ceasefire** (x2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>
    *   Provides extra burn power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

    *   Used to place Fossil Dyna on top of the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Also useful for milling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.
*   **Number 101: Silent Honor ARK** (x1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>
    *   Described as having a "really broken effect" and being a great defensive [[rank_4_and_rank_5_xyz_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Rank 4 Xyz]] to run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

    *   Included solely to allow the Special Summon of Malefic Stardust Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. It is unlikely to be summoned itself as the deck lacks tuners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>, making it a "free" inclusion for its Malefic counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

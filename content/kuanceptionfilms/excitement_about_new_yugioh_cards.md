*   **Junk Changer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   **Maxx "C"** – Described as an "amazing" and "dank pull," the reprinting of Maxx "C" was a surprise to the opener, who preferred to be surprised rather than looking at official lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

*   **Ice Hand** – A card that the opener had always wanted but never pulled before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Mask Change** – A highly desired card, looking "beautiful" in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Impact on Card Value
The high number of [[yugioh_card_reprints | reprints]] in sets like Premium Gold can sometimes impact the market value of existing cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, the overall sentiment towards these [[yugioh_card_reprints | reprints]] is highly positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. For example, a common Mask Change card can be replaced with a newly pulled gold [[yugioh_card_reprints | reprint]] for a hero deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

More [[Yugioh card reactions | Yugioh videos]] featuring the [[Opening Yugioh Card Packs | opening of multiple Premium Gold boxes]] are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

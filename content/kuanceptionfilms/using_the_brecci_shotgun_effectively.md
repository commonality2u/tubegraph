The Brecci shotgun is featured in [[cod_black_ops_3_brecci_gameplay_highlights | Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 gameplay]] commentary, primarily on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It is highlighted as a weapon used for "rushing around" on maps like [[strategies_for_rushing_on_nuketown_and_combine | Nuketown and Combine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, often compiled into "best rushing moments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Brecci Characteristics & Reputation
The Brecci is described as a semi-automatic shotgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Within the game, it is widely considered to be "probably the best shotgun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and "arguably even the best gun" overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Its power level has led some to suggest it "probably needs a nerf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, indicating [[black_ops_3_weapon_balance_issues_on_pc | weapon balance issues]].

## Ease of Use and Accessibility
A significant aspect of the Brecci's effectiveness is its accessibility to players of all skill levels. It is noted that "any noob can just pick up this gun and be a douchebag running around doing the tanking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The weapon is considered "very OP" (overpowered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, contributing to its [[advantages_of_brecci_for_beginners | advantages for beginners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Even players who admit to not being "very good at this game" can "still do pretty good" when using the Brecci <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Performance on PC
The Brecci's potency is particularly emphasized on PC, where higher frame rates (e.g., 120 FPS) reportedly benefit rushers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This highlights potential [[differences_between_pc_and_console_weapon_optimization | differences in weapon optimization between PC and console]] versions of the game.

## Recommended Playstyles
Due to its nature, the Brecci is highly effective for aggressive, close-quarters combat and "rushing" playstyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Users often play on smaller, more chaotic maps like [[strategies_for_rushing_on_nuketown_and_combine | Combine and Nuketown]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, especially within "Chaos Mosh Pit" game modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Using the Brecci allows players to achieve "dank streaks" and "have a blast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The "Annie jungle" is presented as an unconventional [[League_of_Legends_gameplay_strategies | gameplay strategy]] that raises questions among players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Despite its unusual nature, this specific implementation of the [[game_strategy | game strategy]] proves to be effective in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Player Observations and Effectiveness

Early in the game, the team decides to allocate resources, specifically kills, to Annie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This deliberate decision contributes to Annie's growing strength and influence on the map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. One player expresses confidence that this Annie will "do some real stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Kill Participation and Impact

By the 24-minute mark, the Annie player, referred to as "UK," has amassed a significant number of kills, even surpassing the team's AD carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This high kill participation, particularly in the bottom lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, indicates Annie's effective presence and ability to secure takedowns across the map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The success of Annie in a jungle role highlights its potential as a niche but impactful [[Ingame_strategies_and_tactics | ingame strategy and tactic]] within [[Multiplayer_strategies | multiplayer strategies]] and [[map_strategies_and_player_tactics | map strategies]].

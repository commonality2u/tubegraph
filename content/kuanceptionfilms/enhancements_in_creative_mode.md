The 0.8.0 update for [[minecraft_pocket_edition_080_update_features | Minecraft Pocket Edition]] brought significant enhancements to creative mode, expanding item selection and gameplay possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This update is described as the largest seen on MCPE so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Expanded Item Selection
With the increase in available items, creative mode now features new item slots to accommodate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Players can access a wider variety of resources, including:
*   [[ingame_technology_and_items | Rails]] and [[ingame_technology_and_items | mine carts]], including powered rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   [[new_items_and_blocks_in_minecraft_pe | Different colored wood]] types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   [[new_items_and_blocks_in_minecraft_pe | Hay stacks]], which are useful for compact hay storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Decorative and structural items like [[new_items_and_blocks_in_minecraft_pe | iron bars]] and [[new_items_and_blocks_in_minecraft_pe | stone fences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   [[new_items_and_blocks_in_minecraft_pe | Sponges]], though they don't have a functional purpose in this version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   [[new_items_and_blocks_in_minecraft_pe | New seeds and plants]], including pumpkin, melon, carrots, potato, and beetroot seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   [[new_items_and_blocks_in_minecraft_pe | Ink sacks]] and more dye colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## New Building Possibilities
A significant addition is the ability to build with [[new_items_and_blocks_in_minecraft_pe | bedrock]] in creative mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This allows for constructing structures with an unbreakable block.

## Dynamic Interactions
Creative mode now permits the use of TNT, allowing players to detonate blocks and modify the environment dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### General Improvements
While not exclusive to creative mode, the update also features much higher render distance settings and improved [[graphics_and_performance_improvements | graphics]], bringing the visual quality closer to the PC version of Minecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The update is free for users who already own the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

A significant issue exists with weapon balance in Black Ops 3, particularly within the [[experiences_with_gameplay_on_pc | PC community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While the speaker acknowledges enjoying sniping, the prevalent use of specific weapons on PC indicates a deeper problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Dominant Weapons on PC

On [[call_of_duty_console_vs_pc_gameplay | PC]], nearly every player consistently uses the Drakon and P06 sniper rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Approximately three-fourths of players in any given lobby are observed "spamming" these two weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This overuse of the Drakon and P06, alongside the Brecci shotgun, transforms the [[experiences_with_gameplay_on_pc | PC gameplay]] into a "mess of sniper rifles and shotguns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Players desire variety in their [[experiences_with_gameplay_on_pc | gameplay]] and do not wish to encounter the same weapons in every match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The current situation leads to predictable engagements, where players are often shot from multiple angles by the P06 or Drakon upon entering a map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Contrast with Console Weapon Balance

In contrast, weapon balance on console is considered effective and "on point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Treyarch is commended for their [[comparison_of_weapon_optimization_between_pc_and_console | weapon optimization]] on console, where sniper rifles are generally perceived as balanced and not problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Root Cause of the Problem

The speaker asserts that the issue is not the fault of the players, but rather stems from the game developers promoting certain weapons by giving them superior statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The problematic nature of these weapons on PC is attributed to their optimization for console player usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Proposed Solution: Dedicated PC Weapon Balancing

To address the [[gun_balance_and_ingame_mechanics_specific_to_pc_version | weapon balance problems on PC]], the speaker proposes that Treyarch implement [[need_for_dedicated_pc_weapon_balancing_in_black_ops_3 | dedicated weapon balancing for PC players]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This would involve creating [[need_for_dedicated_pc_weapon_balancing_in_black_ops_3 | dedicated weapon stats specifically for the PC community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This concept is described as simple and should not be difficult for developers to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

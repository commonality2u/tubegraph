The state of older Call of Duty titles and the anticipation surrounding new releases have led to discussions about potential future directions for the franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Current Challenges with Classic Call of Duty Titles
Many classic Call of Duty games, such as Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare 2, and World at War, face significant server issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These problems include:
*   **Hacked Lobbies** The presence of hacked lobbies makes [[impact_of_hackers_on_call_of_duty_games | gameplay unplayable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Boosters and BS** Servers are frequently filled with boosters and other disruptive elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Developer Neglect** Infinity Ward is criticized for not addressing the poor conditions of these servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Despite being considered "purest" and "best" Call of Duty games with "amazing multiplayer experiences," these titles are largely unplayable in their current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This forces players to resort to titles like Black Ops 2 or Modern Warfare 3 for a functional multiplayer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Uncertainty Around New Releases
There is significant fatigue among players regarding existing viable options like Black Ops 2, with many expressing tiredness of playing it for multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Newer titles, such as Call of Duty: Ghosts, have been met with disappointment, with players not engaging with them for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The upcoming [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Advanced Warfare]] is viewed with uncertainty, with concerns it might be another disappointment like Call of Duty: Ghosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Proposal: HD Remasters of Classic Titles

A proposed solution to these issues is the release of HD remasters for beloved classic Call of Duty games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Call of Duty 4 HD Remaster
An [[popularity_and_legacy_of_call_of_duty_4 | HD remaster of Call of Duty 4]] for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Such a remaster would include:
*   **Enhanced Graphics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Brand New, Playable Servers** Free from hackers and other issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

This remaster would be highly anticipated as Call of Duty 4 was universally loved by fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Ideally, it would be released for digital download on PlayStation Store and Xbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Subsequent Remasters
Following the Call of Duty 4 remaster, a Modern Warfare 2 HD remaster could be released a year later in the same manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Potential Impact
While such remasters would be highly desired by players, they could potentially drive sales away from new Call of Duty titles like [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Advanced Warfare]] and future releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, this is seen as a secondary concern given the desire for playable classic experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

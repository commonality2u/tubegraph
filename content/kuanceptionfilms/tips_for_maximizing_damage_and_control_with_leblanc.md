This guide provides strategies for playing LeBlanc, focusing on maximizing damage and controlling the lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[item_build_suggestion_for_leblanc | Item Build Suggestions]]

To begin, purchasing a "hexagonal nut" is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. For your first return to base, acquire the "spooky mask" and "star root wand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These items reportedly grant true damage that scales with your current gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## [[strategy_for_early_game_with_leblanc | Early Game Strategy]]

LeBlanc is designed to dominate the lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key early game tactic involves standing near the opposing team's buff to gain an advantage, even without abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. You can also attempt to trick opponents into warding their Krugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Hiding in the top bush can set up impactful plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

At level one, LeBlanc's abilities can easily reduce an enemy's health by half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. LeBlanc is considered "op" and superior in level one trades compared to other champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Upon reaching level three, you can commit to an all-in attack to secure a kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Intentionally missing minions is suggested as it can "motivate" you to secure kills later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Managing Lane Matchups and Opponent Tricks

When facing champions like [[strategic_tips_for_playing_ekko_effectively | Ekko]], be aware of their abilities. For instance, [[strategic_tips_for_playing_ekko_effectively | Ekko]]'s Q is noted as doing minimal damage, making trades unfavorable for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### [[dealing_with_junglers_as_leblanc | Dealing with Junglers]]

If an enemy jungler attempts to gank your lane, it is advised to ignore them as they might steal your kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. When taking your jungler's blue buff, do so quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Mid to Late Game Play

Always return to your W ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. If you die in lane, it should be attributed to minions, not the enemy champion, as you are never the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

It is crucial to steal the Dragon when the enemy team attempts to secure it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. LeBlanc's auto-attacks are described as being "op" and capable of dealing immense damage, allowing you to quickly destroy mid-lane turrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Ensure that Shen steals every super minion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

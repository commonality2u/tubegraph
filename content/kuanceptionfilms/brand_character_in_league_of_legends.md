Brand is a character or champion in the game [[League of Legends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He is noted for his abilities in combat within the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Gameplay and Abilities
Brand is considered a counter to certain opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A significant aspect of Brand's toolkit is his ability to apply [[chain_crowd_control_mechanics_in_league_of_legends | chain CC]] to enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This powerful [[chain_crowd_control_mechanics_in_league_of_legends | chain CC]] can be so effective that it has been speculated to lead to the character being temporarily disabled in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The game developers also engage in "balancing" adjustments for Brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

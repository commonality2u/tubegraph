## Requirements
To perform the cloning glitch, you will need:
*   Items you wish to clone (e.g., diamond) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Follow these steps to duplicate items in Minecraft PE:

1.  **Place Items in Chest:** Open an empty chest and place all the items you wish to clone into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  **Exit Game:** Exit the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
3.  **Log Back In:** Re-open the app and log back into your game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. You should retrieve your items from the chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
4.  **Walk Around:** After exiting the chest, walk around in the game world for 20 to 30 seconds without breaking or changing anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It is recommended to walk for at least a minute to be safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
5.  **End App Process:** Once you've walked for the specified time, exit the game and terminate the app from your device's multitasking bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
6.  **Re-open and Play:** Open the app again, press "play," and return to your game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Upon re-entering, your items should be duplicated, effectively cloning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Uses

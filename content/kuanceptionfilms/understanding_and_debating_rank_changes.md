In [[gaming_discussions | gaming discussions]], particularly within titles like Osu!, the concept of player rank and how it's measured and discussed is a recurring topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | Player rank]] indicates a user's standing or skill level within the game's competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Evolution of Ranking Metrics

The value associated with certain performance metrics, such as Performance Points (PP), can change over time. For instance, having 1,000 PP once corresponded to being ranked around 70,000 (70k), but later, that same 1,000 PP might only place a player around 113,000 (113k) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This shift suggests a potential change in the player base's overall [[player_performance_and_skill_levels | skill level]] or the ranking system's algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Debating Rank Terminology

There is a notable debate regarding the appropriate terminology for changes in rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### "Plus Rank" vs. "Going Down"
When a player achieves a "plus rank," the question arises about what to call it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Some argue that "going down" in rank means progressing towards rank 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### "Minus" and "Getting Bad"
Conversely, a "minus" rank is associated with "getting bad," particularly if one removes the negative connotation from the minus sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### "Gaining Rank" Discussion
The term "gaining rank" is debated as potentially not making sense in the context of numerical ranks, where a lower number signifies a better rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The prevailing view is that "going up in rank" implies moving towards rank 1, likened to climbing a ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. If a rank is "minus," it means falling down the ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Performance Metrics and Score Screen
Player scores, which contribute to rank, are visible on the score screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> and are made up of elements like "fixers" and "x7xlates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. A player's accuracy, for instance, significantly impacts their score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. High accuracy is crucial for better scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Players observe each other's accuracy during gameplay, noting percentages like 83% and 92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. It is also noted that achieving over one million points may be difficult for some players in a specific gameplay mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Some players may experience game lag which can impact their ability to perform well and affect their score or rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

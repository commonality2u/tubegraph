When playing [[strategy_for_early_game_with_leblanc | LeBlanc]], how you interact with junglers, both allied and enemy, can impact your [[league_of_legends_gameplay_strategy | gameplay strategy]].

## Allied Junglers

If an allied "shorna" (jungler) attempts to gank your lane, it is advised to ignore them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19">[01:19]</a>. The reasoning provided is that they may "take your kill because jungle hoes ain't loyal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22">[01:22]</a>.

## Jungle Objectives

*   **Blue Buff**: When taking your jungler's blue buff, it is suggested to complete it quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11">[01:11]</a>.
*   **Dragon**: If the enemy team attempts to take Dragon, you should aim to steal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[02:05]</a>.

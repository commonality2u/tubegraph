In a video by Victor of Quant section films, the opening of the 2015 Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon Mega Tin leads to surprising [[lucky_pulls_and_rare_cards_in_2015_mega_tin | lucky pulls]] and unexpected duplicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Previous Successes and Expectations

The presenter had previously opened the Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon Megatin, where a "frickin Dante" card was pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This pull was described as "the dankest lucky" and occurred in the first 2015 Megatin opened by the presenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Despite this, the presenter expressed doubt about being able to top that previous pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

The 2015 Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon Mega Tin includes a promo pack with two super rares and a platinum secret rare Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The presenter hoped for cards such as another Dante, Stellar Knight Exies, rank fours, Satsana Constructs, or El Shaddoll Winda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. They also expressed a desire *not* to pull cards like Clear Wing Stealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Unexpected Duplicate Dante Pull

The most significant event was the [[Reactions to unexpected and rare card pulls | unexpected pull]] of a second Dante card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-00:04:37>[00:04:37]</a>. The presenter expressed extreme shock and excitement, stating "What the guys guys I think my my packs are trained look at this second doc pick one what the heck okay okay what okay okay literally what I can't I I'm shaking right now what the hell is going on oh my gosh this is a duplicate pack this is oh my gosh guys this is my second Dante in a row second 10 second Dante we're going places in life what this is I can't believe my luck guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Additional [[Rare and Super Rare Card Pulls | rare cards]] pulled include:
*   Magical Spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
*   Number 39: Utopia Beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>

*   Utopia Prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>

The presenter noted the improbability of these [[Yugioh card pulls and reactions | pulls]], especially the duplicate Dante, given that the packs were "mega packs inside of a mega ten" and seemingly impossible to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The video concludes with the presenter marveling at their "insane" luck of getting "two tens two Dante's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

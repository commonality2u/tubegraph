A YuGiOh value cube, often found at retailers like Target, contains various YuGiOh! Trading Card Game products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. These cubes can sometimes have misleading information regarding their contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Gravekeeper's Structure Deck Value Cube

## Value Assessment

The [[opening_a_yugioh_value_cube | opening]] was considered worthwhile, primarily because the Gravekeeper's deck is quite valuable on the secondary [[yugioh_card_market_value | card market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The entire box was purchased for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The inclusion of valuable common cards like Mirror Force, Book of Moon, and Foolish Burial also contributed to its perceived worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

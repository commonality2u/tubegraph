Seth from Conception Films conducts an [[unboxing_and_rare_cards | unboxing]] of what he describes as a rare Yu-Gi-Oh full deck box, which he found at a Walmart, being the last one on the shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The box supposedly contains a full Warlock Burst set deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Deck Box and Uncrating

The uncrating takes place at what Seth calls his "battle station" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The crate initially resembles an egg carton with 18 eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, but it actually contains a Yu-Gi-Oh deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Seth claims the box has "character" due to a few stains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> and is 200 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Contents of the First "Fermentation"

After letting the box "ferment" for about two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, the initial contents are revealed. It first appears to be filled with painted rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Initial Finds

The box yielded:
*   League of Legends RP codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   [[finding_ultra_rare_yugioh_cards | Ultra rare Yu-Gi-Oh cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, presented as a full deck of six cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The specific cards drawn were:
*   A "Charizard ultra ultra rare Yu-Gi-Oh card," described as very rare and not found in stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Another Charizard card, described as "very very good" and shiny, in mint condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   A "Dark Dugtrio," which Seth dismisses as "a piece of crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   A yellow "Raichu" card, possibly Japanese, which turned out to be a "double card" (one card with two sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This was unexpected, making the pack more "[[yugioh_legendary_collection_3_yugis_world_opening | legendary]]" than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   Another Level X card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Another "two-face card," which Seth deemed "magnificent" but also "sucks complete crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Contents of the Second "Fermentation"

The box was left to "ferment" for another two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This time, it produced a "Yu-Gi-Oh starter booster pack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Seth humorously describes it as featuring tempura paint (correcting to tempera paint) in five colors: green, blue, red, white, and yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Seth expresses disappointment with these contents, stating it wasn't what he was looking for, as he wanted more [[yugioh_legendary_collection_3_yugis_world_opening | legendaries]] like those previously pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. He intends to sell the cards for as much money as possible since he does not play Yu-Gi-Oh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Contents of the Third "Fermentation"

After another couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, the box produced "the panda bundle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, consisting of three rare panda figurines. Seth mentions his personal collection of panda figurines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

The figurines include:
*   A traditional bumblebee panda with black stripes, ears, and raccoon-like eye circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   An "ultra rare" panda figurine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, which made him so excited he had to re-record the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Despite jingling due to being broken and having dents, he believes he could sell it for "two cents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   A small, "mighty powerful" panda that supposedly clears the entire Yu-Gi-Oh battle arena of cards, figurines, wax figures, and bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This effect is said to combine with a blue 10 or 25 League of Legends RP card, leading to an instant win in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Seth anticipates the next "most rare set" after the panda bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, leaving the box to ferment for an "exonerable" amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Conclusion and Disappointment

Ultimately, Seth concludes that the experiment failed, and he did not receive anything of worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. He states that the cards are not [[yugioh_legendary_collection_3_yugis_world_opening | legendary]] and are not worth any money, calling them "pieces of crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. He expresses frustration that they cannot be played on the field or stacked with other cards, and that they merely give an opponent twenty dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Seth ends the video, stating he is done making it due to the "crappier and crappier" draws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. He encourages viewers to subscribe to Conception Films, comment ideas, or suggest games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

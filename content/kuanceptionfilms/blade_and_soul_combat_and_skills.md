Combat and skill progression in *Blade and Soul* are central to the gameplay experience. The game is described as an MMORPG that had "millions of players registered" shortly after its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Character Classes and Difficulty
Players choose from various classes, such as Assassin, Blade Master, or Kung Fu Master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The Blade Master class is considered "the least difficult to play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Gameplay Mechanics and Abilities
The game features [[game_mechanics_and_controls | abilities]] and [[champion_abilities_and_combos | combos]] that are described as "intense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Players can learn new skills, such as "glide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Equipping items and skills is straightforward, requiring a simple click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Combat Experience
Combat sequences are a core part of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Early combat involves fighting training dummies in "proving grounds" to practice skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Despite the intensity of combos, one player jokingly called the combat "complete trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Leveling and XP
Players gain experience points (XP) through various activities, including "slave work" for characters like Mr. Hong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. An "XP boost" helps with leveling up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, although one player noted their XP bar didn't move after killing a dummy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### PvP
The game also features player-versus-player (PvP) combat, with a question raised about its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Initial Combat Challenges
Early in the game, it's possible to die quickly, with one player humorously remarking they "already died this game is too good five minutes into the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

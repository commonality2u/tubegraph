[[square_enix_final_fantasy_remakes | Square Enix]] has a history of remaking its NES and SNES Final Fantasy titles for handheld platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Many of the Final Fantasy games remade for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and PSP were considered fantastic and performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Past Handheld Remakes

### Game Boy Advance (GBA)
The Game Boy Advance saw remakes of Final Fantasy 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While these ports were decent, [[square_enix_final_fantasy_remakes | Square Enix]] did not fully redesign the games for the GBA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Nintendo DS (DS)
For the Nintendo DS, [[square_enix_final_fantasy_remakes | Square Enix]] released "killer" remakes of Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. These versions were wonderfully animated 3D renditions of the original games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Final Fantasy 3 is often considered an underrated and neglected title, whereas Final Fantasy 4 is widely praised and loved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The DS remakes featured impressive opening cutscenes:
*   Final Fantasy 3 DS opening cutscene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   Final Fantasy 4 DS opening cutscene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>

## Potential for 3D Remakes on 3DS and PS Vita
Given the quality of the 3D remakes on the DS, there is significant potential for [[square_enix_final_fantasy_remakes | Square Enix]] to remake more Final Fantasy games for the 3DS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

It would be "awesome" to see 3D versions of Final Fantasy 6 or Final Fantasy 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

*   **Final Fantasy 6**
    Final Fantasy 6 features one of, if not the best, plots and soundtracks among all Final Fantasy games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Final Fantasy 5**
    Final Fantasy 5, another underrated Final Fantasy title, boasts a "wonderful class-based character system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

A 3D remake of these two games for both the 3DS and the [[Final Fantasy 10 remaster on PS Vita | PS Vita]] would "undoubtedly be awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

There is currently a [[Final Fantasy 10 remaster on PS Vita | Final Fantasy 10 and 10-2 HD remaster for the PS Vita]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Support from Channel Co-Owner
The host, Victor of Quan Inception Films, extended a "big shout out" to Seth, who is identified as the co-owner of the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Seth assisted in the video production by lending his Elgato game capture device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This assistance was crucial because Victor's personal Elgato game capture had been malfunctioning for several weeks, preventing him from posting console gameplays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

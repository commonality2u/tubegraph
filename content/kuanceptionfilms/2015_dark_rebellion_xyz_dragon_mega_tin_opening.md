This article details the opening of a 2015 Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon Mega Tin, considered "the most anticipated product of 2015" in the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG [00:01:14].

## Tin Contents and Overview

The opened tin was an Iron Man-themed box [00:00:26]. Each 2015 Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon Mega Tin includes:
*   A promo pack containing super rare cards and the Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon [00:00:45].
*   Three 2015 Mega Packs [00:00:54]. These Mega Packs are essentially reprints of all sets released in 2015, featuring "Strato" cards, "Clef For" cards, and other meta cards from the year [00:00:56].

The artwork on the new Mega Tin, featuring the Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon, is described as "fantastic" and "marvelous" [00:01:32]. The Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon card itself looks "amazing in this platinum rare reprint" [00:01:42].

One of the central themes discussed regarding the character of One-Punch Man is his perceived invincibility and unparalleled power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Key Aspects of His Power

*   **Invincibility and God-like Status**: Participants in the discussion describe One-Punch Man as "totally invincible" and "literally a God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This status is attributed to him never dying, despite facing opponents with multiple phases and complex abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **One-Punch Kills**: His defining characteristic is his ability to defeat "everything in one punch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Challenged, but Still Victorious**: Even when encountering a character initially believed to be impossible to defeat in a single blow, One-Punch Man ultimately manages to kill them in "one time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Plot Device Explanation**: The reason for his seemingly limitless power and indestructibility is humorously attributed to the nature of [[discussion_on_anime_and_light_novels | anime]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Despite his overwhelming power, One-Punch Man's primary concerns after defeating opponents sometimes revolve around mundane tasks, such as collecting eggs, often expressing frustration if he misses something like a sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

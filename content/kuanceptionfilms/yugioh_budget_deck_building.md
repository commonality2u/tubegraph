Building a competitive Yu-Gi-Oh! deck on a limited budget is achievable. An example of such a deck, designed for less than $30, demonstrates its effectiveness in competitive play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This approach often involves strategically combining cards from newly opened packs with existing cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## The Anti-Meta Troll Deck Profile

This particular budget deck is a [[yugioh_traptrix_december_2015_deck_profile | Trap Tricks]] Gravekeepers deck, characterized as a "troll," "anti-meta," "burn," and "lockdown" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. It focuses on disrupting opponents' strategies and dealing incremental damage. Gameplay footage on Yu-Gi-Oh Dev Pro demonstrates its competitive viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Monster Cards

The monster lineup is crucial for establishing field presence and executing the deck's lockdown and anti-meta tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

*   **[[yugioh_traptrix_december_2015_deck_profile | Trap Tricks]] Myrmeleo** (2 copies): Essential for the deck. When summoned, it allows you to add any "Hole" Normal Trap Card from your Deck to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. If special summoned, you can destroy an opponent's spell or trap card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **[[yugioh_traptrix_december_2015_deck_profile | Trap Tricks]] Dionaea** (2 copies): Used to special summon [[yugioh_traptrix_december_2015_deck_profile | Trap Tricks]] cards from the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. When normal summoned, it can special summon a [[yugioh_traptrix_december_2015_deck_profile | Trap Tricks]] monster from your graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. When special summoned, it retrieves a "Hole" Trap Card from your graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **[[yugioh_traptrix_december_2015_deck_profile | Trap Tricks]] Nepenthes** (2 copies): Features high defense and a good effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **[[yugioh_traptrix_december_2015_deck_profile | Trap Tricks]] Atrax** (1 copy): Possesses high attack and a useful effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo** (1 copy): A highly essential card. When flipped face-up, it destroys all special summoned monsters on the field, and neither player can special summon monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Gravekeeper's Spy** (2 copies): Considered the best Level 4 Gravekeeper monster for the deck. When flipped face-up, it can special summon another Gravekeeper's monster with 1500 or less ATK from your deck, allowing for an immediate Rank 4 Xyz summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Summoner Monk** (1 copy): Useful for quickly bringing out Level 4 monsters for Rank 4 Xyz summons, such as Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo, to set up a lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Kagetokage** (1 copy): If you normal summon a Level 4 monster, you can special summon this card from your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Malefic Stardust Dragon** (1 copy): Provides extra attack power and is special summoned by removing one Stardust Dragon from your Extra Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. It works well with the numerous field cards in the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Santa Claws** (1 copy): Effective for removing powerful opponent monsters like Quasar or Cyber Dragon Infinity from the field, as its tribute summon cannot be negated if using the opponent's monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Spell Cards

Spell cards support the deck's field control and disruptive capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

*   **Black Garden** (1 copy): An "insane" trolly field card. When a monster is normal or special summoned, its attack is halved, and the opposing player special summons an 800 ATK/800 DEF Level 2 token. This can lead to building a token army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Necrovalley** (2 copies): Essential for the deck. It boosts the ATK and DEF of Gravekeeper's Spy and prevents opponents from special summoning monsters from the graveyard, shutting down many popular decks like Shaddoll and Satellarknights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Terraforming** (2 copies): Provides draw power for field cards, helping to ensure a field spell is available early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Dark Hole** (1 copy): A destruction card useful for clearing the field, especially since some monsters have beneficial effects when sent to the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Swords of Revealing Light** (2 copies): A perfect card for stalling time in this lockdown/troll deck, preferred over Gravity Bind due to the prevalence of Xyz monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Burden of the Mighty** (1 copy): A "trolling" card. Each face-up monster your opponent controls loses 100 ATK for each of its own Levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon (MST)** (1 copy): Essential for getting rid of continuous trap cards and continuous spell cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Trap Cards

The deck heavily relies on its trap cards for defense, disruption, and burn damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

*   **Bottomless Trap Hole** (1 copy): Essential for removing strong special summoned monsters from play. [[yugioh_traptrix_december_2015_deck_profile | Trap Tricks]] cards can easily bring this card out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Trap Hole** (2 copies): While often overlooked, this card is effective when Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo prevents special summoning, forcing opponents to normal summon into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **[[yugioh_traptrix_december_2015_deck_profile | Trap Tricks]] Trap Hole Nightmare** (1 copy): A very good trap card. When a monster special summoned this turn activates its effect on your opponent's side of the field, this card negates that effect and destroys the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Deep Dark Trap Hole** (1 copy): A backup for Bottomless Trap Hole. When a Level 5 or higher effect monster is special summoned, it banishes that monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Solemn Warning** (1 copy): A good and trolly card that negates the summoning of any monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Nightmare Wheel** (2 copies): Preferred over Fiendish Chain. It prevents an opponent's monster from attacking and inflicts 500 damage to the opponent during each of your standby phases, contributing to the "burn" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Coffin Seller** (1 copy): Provides "extra burn power." Each time a monster card is sent to your opponent's graveyard, it inflicts 300 damage to your opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Mirror Force** (1 copy): Included for obvious defensive reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Scrap-Iron Scarecrow** (1 copy): A trolly card that can be reset face-down after use instead of going to the graveyard, providing continuous defensive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Magic Cylinder** (1 copy): Provides extra defensive power and acts as a "burn" trap card, dealing significant damage to the opponent if they attack with a high ATK monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Wall of Disruption** (1 copy): An underappreciated but powerful card. When an opponent's monster declares an attack, all attack position monsters they control lose 800 ATK for each monster they control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device** (1 copy): An essential trap card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Ceasefire** (2 copies): Provides "extra burn power." It can deal significant damage (e.g., 6000 life points if both players have three monsters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### Extra Deck

The Extra Deck is flexible, but some Rank 4 Xyz monsters are considered essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

*   **Lavalval Chain**: Essential for stacking Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo to the top of the deck or for milling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Number 101: Silent Honor ARK**: Has a "broken effect" and is a great defensive Rank 4 Xyz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Number 50: Blackship of Corn**: Deals 1000 damage each turn if the opponent has a monster with less attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Number 55: Gogogo Goliath**: A temporary Rank 4 Xyz that might be replaced, but has a good effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Number 39: Utopia**: An essential Rank 4 Xyz card for any deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Stardust Dragon**: Included solely to summon Malefic Stardust Dragon from the hand, as the deck doesn't have tuners to synchro summon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

The Extra Deck can be customized with other Rank 4 Xyz monsters based on player preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The speaker anticipates adding Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon once reprints make it more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, hinting at future [[yugioh_card_market_value | card market value]] considerations.

When considering the purchase of *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* for PC, two significant features that distinguish the PC experience are Field of View (FOV) customization and the upcoming availability of modding tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. These features contribute to a unique gameplay experience compared to console versions of the game.

## Advantages of Playing Black Ops 3 on PC

While *Black Ops 3* was "undeniably developed for consoles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:42">[07:11:42]</a>, the PC version offers several distinct advantages for players who prefer the [[Call of Duty console vs PC gameplay | PC gaming experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:42">[07:11:42]</a>.

### Field of View (FOV) Customization

One of the prominent advantages for PC players is the ability to customize their Field of View (FOV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:19">[05:24:19]</a>. Unlike consoles that typically have a locked FOV, PC players are "not burdened by a locked fov" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:19">[05:24:19]</a> and can max it out at 120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:07">[05:27:07]</a>.

*   **Enhanced Awareness:** Customizable FOV is considered beneficial in any first-person shooter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:22">[05:31:22]</a>. Increased FOV creates the "illusion of the game being more fast-paced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:19">[05:42:19]</a> and makes players more competitive by providing "heightened visual awareness and peripheral senses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:22">[05:51:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:23">[05:53:23]</a>. This leads to "better and stronger reactions to most gunfights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a>.
*   **Historical Presence:** FOV sliders have been a feature in *Call of Duty* on PC for the most part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:55">[05:37:55]</a>.

### Modding Capabilities

A significant "buying incentive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:19">[06:47:19]</a> for *Black Ops 3* on PC, particularly compared to console versions, is the upcoming availability of PC modding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:32">[06:56:32]</a>.

*   **Custom Content:** Modding will allow players to create their "own custom multiplayer maps and zombie maps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:27">[07:00:27]</a>, introduce "modded game modes," "new guns," and "a whole lot more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. This extensive customization is a source of excitement for the PC community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:44">[07:07:44]</a>.

### Other PC-Specific Benefits

Beyond FOV and modding, the PC version of *Black Ops 3* presents other positive aspects for players, addressing some common [[PC community issues in Black Ops 3 | concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:05">[02:01:05]</a> in the gaming community.

*   **Competitive Environment:** The [[PC community issues in Black Ops 3 | PC community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:07">[06:03:07]</a> is generally a "more competitive player base" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:07">[06:03:07]</a>, meaning "pub stomping" is less common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:18">[06:07:18]</a>. Most players have at least some FPS gaming experience, making it an enjoyable environment for those who seek competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:11">[06:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:15">[06:11:15]</a>.
*   **Mature Player Base:** A notable advantage is the general absence of "small obnoxious children on pc black ops 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:15">[06:22:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:19">[06:24:19]</a>.
*   **In-game Text Chat:** PC *Black Ops 3* includes convenient in-game text chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:14">[06:27:14]</a>. This feature is appreciated by players who prefer "texting about how salty you are rather than screaming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:10">[06:39:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:29">[06:41:29]</a>.

Ultimately, while the PC version of *Black Ops 3* has faced [[optimization problems in Black Ops 3 | setbacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:08">[07:24:08]</a>, if a player has a history of playing first-person shooter games proficiently on PC and values the versatility that comes with PC game modding, they will likely not regret getting *Black Ops 3* for PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:07">[07:26:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:07">[07:27:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:17">[07:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:04">[07:32:04]</a>. For a broader [[pros_and_cons_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | comparison]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a> of platforms, the console version (PS4 or Xbox One) is generally recommended due to its primary development focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:42">[07:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:19">[07:15:19]</a>.

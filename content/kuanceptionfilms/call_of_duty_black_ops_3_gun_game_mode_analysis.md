A significant concern noted shortly after release was the presence of [[optimization_problems_in_black_ops_3 | optimization problems]] on the PC platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC community]] is described as having a "competitive demographic," with players often being "tri-hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. One notable issue faced by PC players, particularly in the Gun Game mode, was the difficulty in [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | finding matches]], with wait times of up to five minutes mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

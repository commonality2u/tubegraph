Throughout the holiday season, particularly around Christmas, the online gaming experience for console players was significantly disrupted due to persistent hacking attacks on major gaming networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Both Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, which were already described as "crappy Network Services to begin with," experienced consistent downtime in the weeks leading up to Christmas due to these attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Lizard Squad's Involvement

A group identified as Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for these "pointless hacks" on PlayStation Network (PSN) and Xbox Live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Despite the speaker's humorous speculation about their identity, Lizard Squad continuously tweeted threats to Sony and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. They consistently promised to take down PSN and Xbox Live, and according to the speaker, they succeeded "almost every time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The attacks continued through Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, confusing the speaker as another group, "Finest Squad," had previously claimed to have taken down Lizard Squad about a week prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The motivation for these attacks was unclear, with the speaker suggesting Lizard Squad didn't even have a clear reason for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Impact on Gamers

The unavailability of these networks had a direct impact on gamers, especially during the holiday season. The speaker illustrates this with a scenario of a child receiving a new PlayStation for Christmas, only to find that the PlayStation Network is inaccessible on Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This highlights the frustration and disappointment experienced by the [[gaming_community_reactions | gaming community]] when attempting to use their new consoles or play online during the holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The speaker also questions the [[response_of_gaming_networks_to_hacking | ability of Sony and Microsoft]] to defend their services, given they are the "two largest gaming networks in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

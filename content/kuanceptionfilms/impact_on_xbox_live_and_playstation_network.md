The holiday season, particularly around Christmas, has been significantly disrupted for some console gamers due to widespread network outages on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network (PSN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Both services were already considered subpar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, but consistent downtime over several weeks, culminating in major outages on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, heightened the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Lizard Squad's Role

The primary group claiming responsibility for these disruptions is "Lizard Squad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The speaker speculates that Lizard Squad is likely a group of young individuals ("acne-ridden 17-year-olds") with excessive free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Despite their seemingly amateur nature, Lizard Squad has consistently tweeted threats to Sony and Microsoft, successfully taking down PSN and Xbox Live almost every time they promised to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The ability of such a small group to affect "the two largest gaming networks in the world" has caused confusion regarding the security measures of Sony and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Finest Squad and Ongoing Confusion

Adding to the complexity, another group of anonymous hackers, known as "the Finest Squad," claimed to have taken down Lizard Squad approximately a week before the Christmas outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This claim, however, was contradicted by Lizard Squad's subsequent successful attacks on PSN and Xbox Live during Christmas Eve and Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Impact on Gamers

The outages have significantly impacted the [[reactions_to_gaming_network_outages | gaming community]], particularly new console owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. An illustrative example highlights the frustration:

> Imagine this: a small child around the age of 12 receives a white [[playstation_4_excitement | PS4]] Destiny bundle for Christmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Dissatisfied, he expresses anger about not getting a black PlayStation with Call of Duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This child, already prone to anger, would be further enraged upon attempting to log into PlayStation Network only to find it unavailable on Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that Lizard Squad's motivations for these hacks were unclear, suggesting they acted without a specific reason, possibly out of boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Malfunctioning Device

The creator's personal Elgato game capture device was malfunctioning, which was described as "very unfortunate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This malfunction prevented the creator from recording and uploading console gameplays for several weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Temporary Solution

To bypass the issue and produce a video, the content creator received assistance from Seth, the channel's co-owner. Seth lent his own Elgato game capture device, enabling the creation of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

The core strategy of a [[yu_gi_oh_traptrix_deck_strategy | Traptrix deck]], particularly a 2015 December profile, is to utilize its draw power engines to quickly assemble [[key_monster_cards_in_traptrix_deck_2015 | Traptrix cards]] and summon powerful Rank 4 and Rank 5 Xyz monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This approach also emphasizes a strong [[building_an_effective_back_row_defense_in_traptrix_deck | back row defense]] with [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | Trap Cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Key Monsters for Xyz Summoning

Several monsters and [[important_spell_and_trap_cards | Spell and Trap Cards]] facilitate the summoning of Xyz monsters:
*   **Assault Halberd**: This Level 4 monster can be special summoned if the player controls no monsters and the opponent controls one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. When it attacks and deals damage, it allows the player to add another Assault Halberd to their hand, serving as an automatic search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It also inflicts piercing damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Norden**: Considered very good and essential for [[synchro_and_xyz_summoning_strategies | Rank 4 plays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. It is also key for summoning Rank 5 Xyz monsters like Tellarknight Ptolemaeus and Stellarknight Delteros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Call of the Haunted**: This card is multi-purpose, allowing for the special summoning of [[key_monster_cards_in_traptrix_deck_2015 | Traptrix monsters]] like Myrmeleo to pop a Spell/Trap Card (acting as an MST) or Dionaea to reuse [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | Trap Hole cards]], directly leading to Rank 4 plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Rank 4 Xyz Monsters

The deck utilizes several standard and effective Rank 4 Xyz monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>:
*   **Stellarknight Delteros**: Requires three Rank 4 monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. It is described as "probably the best Rank 4 card in the deck" because it can destroy opponent's monsters, and when it leaves the field, it allows the player to add another Stellarknight card from their deck or Extra Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
*   **Heroic Champion - Excalibur** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
*   **Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>
*   **Gagaga Cowboy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
*   **Abyss Dweller**: Recommended for "wrecking decks that utilize the graveyard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Rank 5 Xyz Monsters

The deck is also capable of summoning powerful Rank 5 Xyz monsters:
*   **Tellarknight Ptolemaeus**: Essential for summoning Rank 5 Xyz monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Stellarknight Constellar Diamond**: This card can prevent an opponent from playing if they are running Dark monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Number 61: Volcasaurus**: A "pretty good burn card" and a generally strong Rank 5 monster, typically summoned using Tellarknight Ptolemaeus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Constellar Pleiades**: Described as "pretty good" for its ability to return one card from the opponent's side of the field back to their hand, effectively acting as an "instant Compulsory Evacuation Device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Cyber Dragon Infinity**: Mentioned as a card to consider running when it becomes available in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

Some Rank 4 and 5 cards, such as **Ragna Zero** and **Bujintei Kagutsuchi**, are noted as less relevant in the current meta due to the decline of certain archetypes like Nekroz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. However, the importance of [[building_rank_four_decks | Rank 4 plays]] and the inclusion of cards like Abyss Dweller remains consistent for a [[traptrix_gravekeeper_deck_profile | Traptrix Gravekeeper Deck Profile]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages for consumers purchasing Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 on PC, particularly as it is the newest and most relevant Call of Duty title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The Call of Duty franchise originated on PC, with players on the platform since around 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Cons of Playing Black Ops 3 on PC

A primary concern when playing [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | Black Ops 3 on PC]] is the player base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Limited Player Base and Playlists
The PC Call of Duty player base is small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, leading to in-game playlist issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Typically, matches can only be found in Team Deathmatch and Chaos Mosh Pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. On a good day, players might find a rare Free-For-All or Gun Game lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Activision's marketing has largely targeted a younger, console-based audience, which has led to a neglected PC consumer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Aim Assist Imbalance
An issue on [[call_of_duty_console_vs_pc_gameplay | PC Black Ops 3]] is aim assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. While mouse and keyboard users do not get aim assist (as it's not typically demanded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, players using controllers on PC still benefit from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This creates an inconsistency in hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### [[performance_and_optimization_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | Performance and Optimization Issues]]
[[PC gaming optimization issues in Black Ops 3 | Random frame drop spikes]] are a common problem on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Even a friend with SLI 980ti GPUs experiences inconsistent frame rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This is seen as an issue of optimization on Treyarch's part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, suggesting Activision does not adequately fund the PC version of newer Call of Duty games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Even with an AMD 930 GPU, frame rates can drop from 60 to less than 15 FPS for a few seconds on maps with too many textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Some players experience even more severe [[black_ops_3_beta_pc_performance_issues | improper optimization]], with the game not loading past the start menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Such extreme optimization issues are not found on PS4 or Xbox One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Gun Imbalance
A significant issue on [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC Black Ops 3]] is apparent gun imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While console gun balance is generally good with no single "best gun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, this is not the case on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Sniper rifles, specifically the Drakon and P-06, are considered overpowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, often being the only guns seen in lobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. There is a strong [[need_for_dedicated_pc_weapon_balancing_in_black_ops_3 | need for dedicated weapon balancing]] for the PC community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Pros of Playing Black Ops 3 on PC

Despite the drawbacks, [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | Black Ops 3 on PC]] can offer a good experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Customizable FOV
PC players are not burdened by a locked Field of View (FOV) and can maximize it to 120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Customizable FOV is considered a great feature for any first-person shooter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, having been available on PC Call of Duty for the most part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. An increased FOV creates the illusion of faster gameplay and generally makes players more competitive by providing heightened visual awareness and peripheral senses, leading to stronger reactions in gunfights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### More Competitive Player Base
The [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC community]] is generally a more competitive player base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, meaning "pub stomping" is less common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Most players have at least some FPS gaming experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, making it suitable for those who enjoy a more competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Additionally, there are generally fewer small, obnoxious children on [[multiplayer_strategies_and_gameplay_techniques_in_black_ops_3 | PC Black Ops 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### In-Game Text Chat
A convenient feature on [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC Black Ops 3]] is in-game text chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Players often communicate via text as their keyboards are readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, making it a good option for those who prefer texting over screaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### [[pc_gaming_features_like_fov_customization_and_modding_in_black_ops_3 | PC Modding]]
A significant incentive for purchasing [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | Black Ops 3 on PC]] is the upcoming availability of [[pc_gaming_features_like_fov_customization_and_modding_in_black_ops_3 | PC modding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This will include the ability to create custom multiplayer and zombie maps, modded game modes, new guns, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Final Verdict

[[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | Black Ops 3]] was undeniably developed for consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. If you own a current-generation console, it's recommended to get the PS4 or Xbox One version due to the PC version's setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

However, if you have a history of proficiently playing first-person shooter games on PC and enjoy the versatility of [[pc_gaming_features_like_fov_customization_and_modding_in_black_ops_3 | modding]] that comes with PC games, you will likely not regret getting [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | Black Ops 3 for PC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

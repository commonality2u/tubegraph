From: [[kuanceptionfilms]] <br/> 
The video functions as a [[parody_elements_in_the_video | parody]] of a "Champion Spotlight" from *League of Legends*, incorporating various [[parodies and humorous commentary | humorous elements]] throughout its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### Imitation of Champion Spotlight Format
The video immediately establishes its [[parody_elements_in_the_video | parodic nature]] by mimicking the standard introduction of a *League of Legends* champion spotlight, including a title like "XX Slayer XX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It presents the character, "Allow E," as a "native of the serpent isles" and a "frequent visitor bone hub" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, following the typical lore-giving format, albeit with an unusual location name.

### Humorous Ability Descriptions
The explanations for abilities, while maintaining the "Q," "E," and "Ultimate" structure, inject [[Humorous narration and commentary | humorous and nonsensical advice]]. For instance, when describing "Tentacle Smash," the narrator advises players to "delude yourself up a little while laying the flap down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> to harass opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, and refers to potential targets as "potential suckers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Exaggerated Commentary and Gamer Talk
The video's [[Humor and commentary in gaming videos | commentary]] shifts from informative to exaggerated gamer talk. The repeated phrase "Alright, let's get cracking on the gameplay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, becomes increasingly repetitive, adding a comedic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The narrator interjects with self-aggrandizing (yet self-aware) statements, such as declaring "Allow E is hello a strong wow you've got a God with you but you are not actually a god" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, and boasting about being "recently silver" and able to "wreck any scrub" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Parodic Conclusion
The video concludes with a parodic take on the typical "team fight" showcase, humorously referred to as "the customary big-ass gas gas gas gas team fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The final call to action to subscribe to "on section feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> further emphasizes the [[Humor in video games | humorous]] and [[parody_elements_in_the_video | parodic]] nature of the entire presentation.

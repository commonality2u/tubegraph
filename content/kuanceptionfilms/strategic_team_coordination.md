In competitive gameplay, [[team_strategy_and_coordination | strategic team coordination]] is crucial for success, encompassing effective communication, objective prioritization, and adapting to [[league_of_legends_gameplay_strategy | gameplay strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Communication and Calls

Effective [[gameplay_communication_and_skype_calls | communication]] is a cornerstone of team play. Players make calls such as initiating "level one hooks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, and teammates encourage specific plays, like a "flash hook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Issues can arise when teammates are in separate [[gameplay_communication_and_skype_calls | Skype calls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, which players describe as "dumb" because it hinders unified action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The importance of getting "in the group back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> highlights the need for a shared communication channel.

## Objective Focus and Kill Distribution

Teams coordinate on [[importance_of_map_objectives_in_heroes_of_the_storm | map objectives]], such as calling to "take mid tower" while simultaneously instructing teammates to "get top tower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Kill distribution is also part of [[team_strategy_and_coordination | team strategy]], with players sometimes deciding to yield kills to specific teammates, like giving a kill to an "Annie jungle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, even if it means missing out on personal farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This demonstrates a willingness to prioritize the team's overall strength, despite personal concerns about kill count versus a teammate's progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Player Roles and Strategic Adaptation

Teams may identify a primary damage dealer or "carry," such as a "Thresh carry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, and focus on enabling that player. Players also offer assistance to teammates, stating, "I got you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, or explaining their actions, such as hooking an enemy even if it leads to their own death, to show their contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This cooperative mindset contributes to overall team effectiveness.

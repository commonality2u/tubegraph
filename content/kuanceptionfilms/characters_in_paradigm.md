The game *Paradigm* features a cast of peculiar characters, starting with the protagonist themselves, and extending to a variety of quirky, often grotesque, non-player characters (NPCs) and sentient objects that contribute to the game's unique, satirical tone.

## Paradigm (Player Character)

The main character is initially presented as a "weird-lookin looking hand thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This character is later revealed to be Paradigm, a "mutant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> or a "paradigm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> designed by Gero del Genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Paradigm's appearance is notable, particularly the "thing that's on his head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, which is described as a "butt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> or a "tumor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. He is the "prodigal child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> who is destined to destroy the world, or at least a 300-kilometer radius of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Gero del Genetics & Its Creations

The game introduces the Gero del Genetics corporation through an infomercial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Infomercial Host**: A "creepy dude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> hosts the infomercial, questioning viewers about their "child of failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Gero del Genetics offers a solution to "destroy your pathetic child" and create the "desirable child of your dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The process involves combining "broken dreams" with "cutting-edge genetic sequencing technology" and a "secret sauce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These genetically engineered children can be anything from "scientists" to "wizards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Designer Children**: The infomercial promises to deliver an "ideal G child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, ensuring a child's success rather than leaving it to chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Sentient Objects & Other NPCs

*   **John (The Computer)**: John is a crucial character described as a computer that needs to be plugged in to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. He holds vital information, including the game's backstory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **HAL 9000-esque Computer**: This computer, reminiscent of HAL 9000 from *2001: A Space Odyssey*, requires a "ward" and a reinstallation of its operating system due to a bug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. It asks Paradigm to find a "ward" to help it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Music-Loving Robot**: A "partying robot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> who seems to be "smoking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a> and listening to music.
*   **The Mailbox (Austin)**: A sentient mailbox named Austin, who can communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a> and requires a map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Austin is described as "47 years old and comfortably appeal in the fetish for boxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, noting that a fetish for boxes would be "very uncomfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. He needs the map to send "wrongly delivered mail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Babushka Mailbox**: Another mailbox, this one named Babushka, which is "hidden up your games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **DJ Jesus**: A figure worshipped in a "shrine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, described as "Dr. Jesus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> and appears to be a musical idol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Talking Dog**: Mentioned as the vendor from whom DJ Jesus's record collection was bought for ten euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Character Relationships & [[Character interactions and dialogue]]

The interactions between characters often drive the [[plot_and_narrative_of_paradigm | plot and narrative of Paradigm]], with characters giving quests or providing humorous, often bizarre, dialogue. Paradigm's initial goal is to fix John the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, which then leads to interactions with other characters like the HAL 9000-esque computer and the mailbox Austin. The dialogue is characterized by its self-awareness and comedic elements, such as the HAL 9000 computer acknowledging its similarity to the famous AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, or the player character breaking the fourth wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

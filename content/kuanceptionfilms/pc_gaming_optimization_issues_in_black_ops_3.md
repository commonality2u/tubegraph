Upon its release, *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* on PC has presented significant [[optimization_problems_in_black_ops_3 | optimization problems in Black Ops 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The game's [[performance_and_optimization_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | PC version]] is generally described as "pretty shitty" at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Specific Performance Problems

Players have reported noticeable performance issues, particularly frequent and "terrible" frame drops during gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. These "crapped" frame drops are evident even during crucial moments of play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, although players can still achieve kills "despite the terrible frame couples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Platform Comparison

In [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | comparison of Black Ops 3 on different platforms]], the PlayStation 4 version of the game is noted to be "running very well" and was "very fun to play" since its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The game was also released on Xbox One and last-generation consoles like the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, though purchasing it on last-gen consoles is not recommended as it's "not a very good investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Outlook

There is an expressed hope that these [[optimization_problems_in_black_ops_3 | optimization problems in Black Ops 3]] on the PC version will be addressed and fixed in the weeks following the game's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Notes on [[illaoi_champion_abilities | Illaoi]] Gameplay

[[illaoi_champion_abilities | Illaoi]] was mentioned as a "new champion" at the time of this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

A strategy for playing [[illaoi_champion_abilities | Illaoi]] involves using her W (Tentacle Smash) and R (Leap of Faith) abilities. The suggested combo is to use W to jump onto an enemy AD carry, then immediately press R <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. After this initial burst, it is recommended to wait for W to become available again, as its cooldown can be as low as three seconds with 45% Cooldown Reduction (CDR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

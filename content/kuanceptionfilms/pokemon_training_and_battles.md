The world of Pokémon is inhabited by creatures known as Pokémon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These creatures live in tall grass, and trainers are advised to have their own Pokémon for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Initial Pokémon Selection

During the initial stages of [[pokemon_fire_red_gameplay | Pokémon Fire Red gameplay]], players are prompted to choose their first Pokémon. The commentator selected Squirtle, noting that they had previously used the other available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The chosen Pokémon was comically named "slave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Pokémon Battles

Pokémon battles are a core component of the gameplay.
*   **Rival Battles** The commentator's rival, named "69", chose Bulbasaur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> and immediately challenged the player to a battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The commentator expressed surprise at being challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Early Game Challenges** Battles can be challenging, particularly early on. The commentator recalled a past experience where a battle between a "Turtle against a rat" (likely Squirtle vs. Rattata) seemed "impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Escape Mechanics** During battles, players may attempt to escape, but sometimes find they "can't escape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Training Pokémon

After battles, both the player and the rival indicate their intention to train their Pokémon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This suggests that training is an ongoing process crucial for progress.

## In-Game Items

Items like "potions" are available to help Pokémon recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Gameplay Experience

The commentator noted that the game's speed could be slow, and chose to "make it faster" for a better experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

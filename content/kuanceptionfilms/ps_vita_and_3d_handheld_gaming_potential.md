Square Enix has a history of remaking its NES and SNES Final Fantasy titles for handheld platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Many of these remakes for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and PSP were considered "fantastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Evolution of Handheld Remakes

Early Game Boy Advance [[comparison_of_handheld_platform_remakes_for_final_fantasy | Final Fantasy remakes]], including *Final Fantasy 1*, *2*, *4*, *5*, and *6*, were decent ports but not complete redesigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

However, Square Enix delivered "killer remakes" for the Nintendo DS with *Final Fantasy 3* and *Final Fantasy 4* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These versions were "wonderfully animated 3D" renditions of the original games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. *Final Fantasy 3* is noted as an underrated title, while *Final Fantasy 4* is widely praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Future Potential for 3D Remakes

Given the success of the 3D remakes on the DS, there is significant [[potential_for_3d_remakes_of_final_fantasy_v_and_vi | potential for 3D remakes of Final Fantasy V and VI]] on newer handhelds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. A 3D version of *Final Fantasy 6*, known for its strong plot and soundtrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, or *Final Fantasy 5*, with its "wonderful class-based character system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, would be desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

There is enthusiasm for seeing these [[final_fantasy_vi_remake_ideas_for_3ds_and_ps_vita | Final Fantasy VI remake ideas for 3DS and PS Vita]], specifically 3D remakes of *Final Fantasy 5* and *6*, released for both the Nintendo 3DS and the PS Vita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Current PS Vita Offerings

The PS Vita currently features an HD remaster of *Final Fantasy 10* and *Final Fantasy 10-2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

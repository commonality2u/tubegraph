The [[gravekeeper_structure_deck | Gravekeeper's Structure Deck]], when purchased as part of a [[yugioh_value_cube_contents_and_value | YuGiOh Value Cube]] from Target for $9.99, is considered a worthwhile acquisition due to its value on the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. The deck itself is described as "pretty pricey on the secondary market today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

Key cards and features contributing to its perceived value include:
*   **Structure Deck Contents:** The deck is noted to contain a 40-card deck, despite misleading packaging suggesting otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Notable Cards:**
    *   [[yugioh_card_market_value | Gravekeeper's Assailant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>
    *   [[yugioh_card_market_value | Gravekeeper's Descendant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>
    *   [[yugioh_card_market_value | Gravekeeper's Spy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>
    *   [[yugioh_card_market_value | Mystic Tomato]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>
    *   [[yugioh_card_market_value | Creature Swap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>
    *   [[yugioh_card_market_value | Book of Moon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>
    *   [[yugioh_card_market_value | Foolish Burial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>
    *   [[yugioh_card_market_value | Mirror Force]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>
    *   [[yugioh_card_market_value | Necrovalley]] (two copies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>

The overall value of the contents, particularly the [[gravekeeper_structure_deck | Gravekeeper's]] cards and other staples, makes the purchase of the [[yugioh_value_cube_contents_and_value | Value Cube]] for $9.99 "definitely worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

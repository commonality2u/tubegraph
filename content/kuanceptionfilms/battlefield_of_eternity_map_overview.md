The Battlefield of Eternity is a map featured in the game, which was considered "new" at the time of this video's recording, having been released a few weeks prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This map is notable for having only two lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:39:00">[28:39:00]</a>.

## Map Objectives: Immortals

A central objective on this map involves Immortals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Players aim to damage and defeat these Immortals, which can be found in various locations, sometimes right next to a player's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Successfully taking down an Immortal is a key step towards victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. Teams will often engage in fights over control of Immortals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>, prioritizing their destruction while protecting their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>. Once an Immortal is down, it opens up opportunities to push further into the enemy base, for example, attacking the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11:00">[26:11:00]</a>.

## Strategy Considerations

*   **Pushing vs. Objective**: While some heroes or [[ingame_strategies_and_tactics | playstyles]] might focus heavily on pushing lanes and damaging structures, the Battlefield of Eternity's design with Immortals encourages playing the objective more directly compared to maps where pushing might be the sole focus for certain heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>.
*   **Lane Control**: Due to only having two lanes, controlling specific lanes, such as the bottom lane, can be crucial for a team's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>.

This article explores the differences between Japanese and English versions of [[yugioh_synchron_extreme_japanese_structure_deck | Yu-Gi-Oh! Structure Decks]], focusing on release, availability, and physical characteristics.

## Release and Availability
The [[yugioh_synchron_extreme_japanese_structure_deck | Synchron Extreme Structure Deck]], for example, was released in Japanese and Korean before its English counterpart was available in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For players in the US, [[importing_japanese_yugioh_cards | importing Japanese Yu-Gi-Oh! cards]] often means purchasing them from Amazon, where they ship from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. However, with Amazon Prime, some Japanese products can ship from a US facility, arriving in as little as two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Physical Characteristics
Japanese [[Opening Yugioh Card Packs | Yu-Gi-Oh! card packs]] look "quite different" from their English counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
A notable distinction is in packaging:
*   **Japanese Structure Decks** typically come in plastic holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **English Structure Decks** use regular paper packaging to hold the entire deck together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Some players perceive the cards themselves to have a different feel, with Japanese cards sometimes described as feeling "really good in the hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Aesthetic preferences also extend to card art, with "Junk Warrior" noted as looking "nice in Japanese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Card Content and Language
Japanese cards, naturally, feature text in Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. To understand their effects and names, players often need to consult external resources that provide English translations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Rarity
Japanese sets introduce specific rarity types, such as the "Super Parallel Rare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, which may differ from or have different appearances compared to English rarities. The [[yugioh_synchron_extreme_japanese_structure_deck | Synchron Extreme Structure Deck]] includes one Ultra Parallel Rare (Stardust Warrior), three Super Parallel Rares, six Normal Parallel Rares, and 34 Commons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Included Cards and Reprints

In first-person shooter (FPS) games, players often attempt various strategies to eliminate opponents, including sniping.

## Sniping Attempt in [[modern_warfare_3_gamplay | Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay]]

During a [[modern_warfare_3_gameplay | Modern Warfare 3 gameplay]] session, a player recounted an instance where they attempted to snipe an opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This specific [[ingame_action_sequences | ingame action sequence]] involved positioning oneself to take a shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Outcome of the Sniping Attempt

The sniping attempt ultimately failed, resulting in the player's character being eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The player noted that the opponent took an extended period, metaphorically "like 10 years," to secure the kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

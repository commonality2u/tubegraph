## Product Overview

The blister pack acquired from Target contained 40 sleeves, one booster pack, and two foil promo cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## [[Opening and unboxing experience | Unboxing Process]]

The [[opening_and_box_experience | unboxing process]] began by cracking open the blister pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The booster pack included was a "Judgment of the Light" pack, which appeared slightly scrunched up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Of the two foil promo cards, one was already known to be "Dark Hole," with the other being a mystery until the pack's [[opening_and_box_experience | unboxing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The booster pack was opened in a specific manner described as "the Dank way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Card Reveals

From the "Judgment of the Light" booster pack, the rare card pulled was "Mecha Phantom Beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

The two foil promo cards included in the blister pack were:
*   Dark Hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   Instant Fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

### Notable Pull: Instant Fusion

"Instant Fusion" was highlighted as one of the best possible promo cards to receive, particularly useful for building Rank 4 decks and synergizing well with "Norden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Unboxing Details

The unboxing consisted of 24 packs of Star Pack Arc V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The video creator opted for individual packs rather than a booster box, believing there weren't many "good cards" in the set besides specific chase cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Each pack contained only three cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

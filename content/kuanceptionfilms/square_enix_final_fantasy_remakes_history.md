Square Enix has a history of remaking its older Final Fantasy titles from the NES and SNES eras for handheld platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Many of these remakes, released for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and PSP, were considered fantastic and performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Game Boy Advance Remakes
For the Game Boy Advance (GBA), Square Enix released remakes of *Final Fantasy 1* and *2*, as well as *Final Fantasy 4*, *5*, and *6* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While these GBA titles were decent ports, they were not complete redesigns of the original games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Nintendo DS Remakes
The Nintendo DS saw "killer" 3D remakes of *Final Fantasy 3* and *Final Fantasy 4* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. These versions were wonderfully animated 3D interpretations of the original games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   *Final Fantasy 3* is regarded by some as the most underrated and neglected *Final Fantasy* game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The DS remake features a beautifully animated opening cutscene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   *Final Fantasy 4* is widely praised and loved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Its DS remake also includes an epic opening cutscene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Future Remake Potential
Given the quality of the 3D remakes for the DS, there is significant [[potential_for_3d_remakes_of_final_fantasy_v_and_vi | potential for 3D remakes of Final Fantasy V and VI]] on modern handhelds like the Nintendo 3DS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

*   *Final Fantasy 6* is noted for having one of the best plots and soundtracks among all *Final Fantasy* games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Ideas for a [[final_fantasy_vi_remake_ideas_for_3ds_and_ps_vita | Final Fantasy VI remake for 3DS and PS Vita]] have been suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   *Final Fantasy 5*, another underrated title, features a notable class-based character system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

A 3D remake of both *Final Fantasy 5* and *Final Fantasy 6* for the 3DS and PS Vita would be "undoubtedly awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### PS Vita
The PS Vita currently offers an HD remaster of *Final Fantasy 10* and *Final Fantasy 10-2* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

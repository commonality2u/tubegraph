Jiggle physics are a notable visual feature within the MMORPG [[Blade and Soul gameplay overview | Blade and Soul]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This graphical effect, which simulates the realistic movement of soft body parts, is described as significantly exaggerated within the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Exaggerated Animation

The jiggle physics in [[Blade and Soul gameplay overview | Blade and Soul]] are characterized by an extreme level of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. One observer likened the effect to imagining an "ocean" with its movement amplified by "jiggle physics times seven," indicating a highly dynamic and almost comedic level of animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This effect is noticeable during [[character customization in blade and soul | character customization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> and appears to "go crazy" when changing hairstyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Even male characters are noted to have this effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Performance Implications

The intensity of the jiggle physics can impact [[performance issues in gaming | game performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. To fully appreciate the effect without significant slowdowns, it is suggested that players require a "dank computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Furthermore, the extensive animation associated with these physics contributes to a "large video file" size for gameplay recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

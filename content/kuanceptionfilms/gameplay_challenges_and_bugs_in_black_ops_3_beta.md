The Black Ops 3 beta on PC presented several [[challenges_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | challenges]] and bugs for players, primarily related to performance and optimization. The speaker, a self-identified console Call of Duty player, found it difficult to adapt to the PC version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Performance and Optimization Issues
The game ran "terribly" on the speaker's PC, despite using a 750 Ti graphics card, which was considered not outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Key performance issues included:
*   Inconsistent frame rates with "huge drops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   A general lack of optimization for PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   "Game breaking lag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

This lack of [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | optimization]] for PC was a significant disappointment, given Call of Duty's historical roots as a PC-exclusive title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While some past titles like *Modern Warfare 3* and *Black Ops 2* felt "all right" on PC, *Black Ops 1* and *Ghosts* were described as poorly optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The [[black_ops_3_beta_pc_performance | Black Ops 3 beta PC performance]] was considered "not looking ideal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In contrast, the PlayStation 4 beta was described as "amazing" and enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

It was hoped that these performance issues would be resolved for the game's official release, with a call for Treyarch to "optimize the game for PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It was suggested that PC players without a "killer machine" would experience lag and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Other Technical Issues
Beyond general performance, a specific technical bug was noted where a friend downloaded the beta but "didn't get the right version," causing the game to not work for them, preventing it from opening or connecting to servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Gameplay-Specific Challenges
*   **Melee Attacks**: Melee attacks were noted as "op" (overpowered) in Black Ops 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **Environmental Hazards**: The game featured "too many ways to die via falling off cliffs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, leading to frequent accidental deaths.
*   **Player Skill**: The speaker admitted to not being "very good" at the Black Ops 3 beta on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Positive Aspect
Despite the numerous challenges, the [[audio_quality_in_black_ops_3 | audio quality in Black Ops 3]] was highly praised as "amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

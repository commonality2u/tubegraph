The commentary on *Pokemon* highlights several core [[game_mechanics_and_controls | gameplay mechanics]] and item interactions within the game.

## Game Speed
The player notes that the game can be "slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. A [[game_mechanics_and_controls | game mechanic]] allows players to adjust the speed to make it "faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Wild Pokémon Encounters
Wild Pokémon are described as inhabiting "Tall Grass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, indicating a [[gameplay_mechanics_of_paradigm | game mechanic]] where entering these areas can trigger encounters. Players are provided with their "own Pokemon for your protection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> in these unsafe zones.

## Starter Pokémon Selection
A significant [[gameplay_mechanics_of_paradigm | gameplay mechanic]] involves choosing a starter Pokémon. The player mentions having "already used all of them except for Squirtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, leading to the selection of Squirtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The rival character also selects a Pokémon, often one that has a type advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Pokémon Battles
Battles are a fundamental [[heroes_of_the_storm_game_mechanics | game mechanic]]. The player is forced into a battle by the rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, even if they "didn't challenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> them. During certain encounters, players may find that they "can't escape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> from a battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Pokémon Training
After obtaining a Pokémon, the player expresses the intention to "go train my Pokemon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, indicating the [[gameplay_terminology_and_mechanics_in_osu | gameplay mechanic]] of improving a Pokémon's abilities through repeated battles or other means.

## Item Usage
The commentary humorously refers to a "potion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> as an in-game item, joking about physically grabbing it from the computer screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, implying its role as a consumable item for healing or other benefits.

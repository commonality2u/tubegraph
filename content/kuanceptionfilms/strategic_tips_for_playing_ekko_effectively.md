[[introduction_to_ekko_as_a_league_of_legends_champion | Ekko]] is described as a "daredevil genius who uses his inventions to survive and thrive on the corrupted streets" [00:00:15].

## Abilities and Mechanics

[[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | Ekko]] possesses a unique set of abilities that can be leveraged for both offense and escape:

*   **Triggering Resonance (Passive)**: Applying resonance on an enemy champion grants [[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | Ekko]] extra damage and a slow effect [00:00:21].
*   **Parallel Convergence (W)**:
    *   **Passive**: [[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | Ekko]]'s basic attacks deal additional magic damage to low-health enemies [00:00:38].
*   **Phase Dive (E)**: [[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | Ekko]] can pass through terrain using both parts of this ability [00:00:42].
*   **Chrono Break (R)**: When [[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | Ekko]] uses Chrono Break, he briefly becomes untargetable and invulnerable [00:00:54]. Upon reappearing, he heals based on the damage he has recently sustained [00:00:59].

[[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | Ekko]]'s kit allows for strong burst and escape potential, utilizing crowd control alongside his standard attacks [00:01:10].

### Utilizing Crowd Control
[[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | Ekko]] has access to various crowd control tools, including stuns, snares, and bolos [00:01:10]. These are crucial for setting up kills and controlling engagements.

### Targeted Assassinations
A key strategy involves targeting isolated enemies:
*   Identify an enemy positioned away from their team [00:01:22].
*   Engage quickly to secure the kill [00:01:25].
*   Disengage immediately before the enemy team can react [00:01:27].

### Chrono Break Combos
A potential combo involves using [[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | Ekko]]'s Chrono Break within a slowing zone:
*   As the enemy team enters a slowing zone (likely from [[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | Ekko]]'s W - Parallel Convergence) [00:01:36].
*   Use Chrono Break to return to the slowing zone [00:01:38].
*   It's emphasized that without proper vision, enemies might walk directly into your stun, making them vulnerable [00:01:43].

It is important to note that playing [[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | Ekko]] incorrectly can lead to poor outcomes [00:01:50].

This article details the initial stages of a Pokémon journey, including the [[professor_oaks_introduction_and_pokemon_selection | Professor Oak]]'s introduction, [[professor_oaks_introduction_and_pokemon_selection | Pokémon selection]], and the first rival battle.

## Initial Game Setup

The player begins a new Pokémon adventure, opting to play as a girl [[character_selection_and_gameplay_strategies_in_super_smash_bros | character]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The player's chosen name for their character is "69" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. An early observation by the player involves increasing the [[game strategy | game speed]] for faster gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Professor Oak's Introduction and Pokémon Selection

[[professor_oaks_introduction_and_pokemon_selection | Professor Oak]] explains that the world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. He emphasizes the need for a Pokémon for protection when venturing into tall grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The player notes this information is obvious, having played the game before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

When it's time to choose a Pokémon, the player ultimately selects Squirtle, stating they have "already used all of them except for Squirtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The player nicknames their Squirtle "slave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## First Rival Battle

Shortly after selecting their Pokémon, the player's rival, named "169," initiates the first battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The rival also takes a Pokémon, implied to be Bulbasaur, as it's the remaining starter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

During the battle, the player describes the matchup as a "freaking Turtle against a rat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Reflecting on past experiences, the player recalls finding this initial battle "impossible" the first time they played the [[pokemon_firered_walkthrough | game]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

After the battle, the rival departs, telling the player "smell you later grams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The player then states their intention to train their Pokémon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Post-Battle Considerations

Following the first battle, the player indicates a desire to acquire "free stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> and contemplates buying items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

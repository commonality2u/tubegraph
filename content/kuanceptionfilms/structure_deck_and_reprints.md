This article discusses the contents of Yu-Gi-Oh! value cubes, focusing on the included structure decks and the impact of card reprints on their market value.

## Value Cubes and Included Structure Decks
A value cube typically contains a 40-card deck along with 25 additional cards, including 5 foil cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The specific value cube unboxed in this instance includes the Fairy Structure Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Another type of structure deck mentioned is the Noble Knights Structure Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Value cubes are considered good value due to their price, often costing around $9.99, which is comparable to the price of a standard structure deck alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. They guarantee at least two booster packs and a promo pack in addition to the structure deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Price and Scarcity
The Fairy Structure Deck, for example, was purchased for $9.99 within a value cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Online, the Fairy Structure Deck is often more expensive than $9.99 because it has not received a [[yugioh_card_reprints | reprint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This highlights how the lack of [[yugioh_card_reprints | reprints]] affects supply and demand, driving up the price of older, un-reprinted decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Card Reprints
[[yugioh_card_reprints | Reprints]] play a significant role in the accessibility and value of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.

### Promo Pack Reprints
The value cube often includes a promo pack with cards from sets like Legendary Collection 5D's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This particular promo pack contains notable cards such as Shooting Quasar Dragon, Fenrir the Nordic Wolf, Stardust Spark Dragon, and Black Rose Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. These are considered "really good [[reprints_of_classic_yugioh_cards | reprints]]" and add significant value to the value cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

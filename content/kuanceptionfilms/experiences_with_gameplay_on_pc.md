## Black Ops 3 PC Gameplay Overview

*Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* PC gameplay primarily featured the Brecci shotgun on Nuketown and Combine maps, specifically within Chaos Moshpit lobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The session highlighted "dank Brecci gameplay," including compilations of effective rushing moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### The Brecci Shotgun on PC

The Brecci is described as potentially the best shotgun in the game, and arguably the best gun overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It is a semi-automatic weapon considered "very OP" on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. There is a strong sentiment that the Brecci "probably needs a nerf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

A key advantage of the Brecci on PC is its effectiveness when combined with higher frame rates, such as 120 FPS, which benefits rushing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The gun's ease of use is a recurring theme, with the assertion that "any noob can just pick up this gun and be a douchebag running around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Lobby Observations

Lobbies during the gameplay sessions included "Christmas noobs," indicating an influx of newer or less experienced players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This observation contributes to overall [[gaming_discussions | gaming discussions]] about player skill variations.

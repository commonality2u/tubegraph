Account ban issues can arise in online gaming communities, leading to players being unable to access certain platforms or groups. These issues can prompt users to take steps to regain access, sometimes resulting in further complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Bans

One player reported being banned from a community identified as "weak people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In response to this ban, the player had to deactivate their existing account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> and create a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> without using their real name, which resulted in the new account having a "really weird" name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This action relates to [[identity_and_anonymity_in_online_gaming | identity and anonymity in online gaming]] and the steps players may take to circumvent restrictions.

## Attempted Workarounds and Further Bans

Upon requesting to rejoin the community with the new account, the player was banned again by an individual named Peter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The player suspected that Peter recognized their connection to the old account, possibly because Peter had previously allowed the player to post videos under their original name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This suggests that even with attempts to change [[identity_and_anonymity_in_online_gaming | identity]], community administrators may still be able to identify previously banned users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

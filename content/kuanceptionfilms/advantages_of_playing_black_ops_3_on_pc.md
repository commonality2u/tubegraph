While [[pros_and_cons_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | Black Ops 3 on PC]] has some drawbacks, it can offer a positive experience for players who enjoy its unique benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:28">[05:18:28]</a>.

## Customizable Field of View (FOV)
PC players are not restricted by a locked Field of View (FOV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:20">[05:22:20]</a>. The FOV can be maximized up to 120, which is considered a significant advantage for any first-person shooter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:10">[05:27:10]</a>. This feature has been available on PC Call of Duty titles for the most part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:78">[05:37:78]</a>. Increasing the FOV creates the illusion of a more fast-paced game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:07">[05:42:07]</a> and generally makes players more competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:17">[05:46:17]</a>. A higher FOV grants players heightened visual awareness and peripheral senses, leading to better and stronger reactions in gunfights and competitive situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:24">[05:51:24]</a>.

## Competitive and Mature Player Base
The PC community for Black Ops 3 is generally more competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:36">[06:03:36]</a>. Players are less likely to encounter "pub stomping" because most have at least some FPS gaming experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:34">[06:07:34]</a>. If a player enjoys a more competitive environment, they will likely enjoy Black Ops 3 on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:28">[06:13:28]</a>. Additionally, there are generally fewer "small obnoxious children" on PC Black Ops 3, which is considered a significant positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

## In-Game Text Chat
A beneficial feature of PC Black Ops 3 is the in-game text chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:07">[06:27:07]</a>. Many players prefer to communicate via text because their keyboards are readily available, making it convenient for expressing frustration rather than screaming into a microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

## Upcoming Modding Capabilities
One of the greatest incentives to purchase Black Ops 3 on PC over consoles is the upcoming availability of PC modding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:04">[06:47:04]</a>. This will allow players to create custom multiplayer maps and zombie maps, introduce modded game modes, and add new guns, among other possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:39">[06:58:39]</a>. This feature is highly anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:04">[07:07:04]</a>.

## Conclusion
While Black Ops 3 was undeniably developed with consoles in mind, and the PC version does have some [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | setbacks]] and [[issues_with_player_base_on_pc_black_ops_3 | player base issues]], it can be a rewarding experience for those with a history of playing first-person shooter games proficiently on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. The versatility of modding and the competitive environment make it a worthwhile choice for many PC gamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:07">[07:31:07]</a>.

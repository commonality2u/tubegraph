Treyarch, the developer of *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3*, faces a significant problem with weapon balance on PC that has become "out of hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This issue primarily concerns the prevalence of specific weapons, leading to an unbalanced gameplay experience for PC players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Problem on PC

On PC, players predominantly use the Drakon and P-06 sniper rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. In almost any lobby, three-fourths of the players are seen "spamming" these weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The Brecci shotgun is also a heavily used weapon, contributing to the feeling of saturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While the speaker doesn't have an issue with sniper rifles in general and finds them satisfying to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, their overwhelming presence indicates a [[black_ops_3_weapon_balance_issues_on_pc | weapon balance problem]] on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This lack of variety leads to repetitive gameplay, where players know what to expect in every match and often get shot from multiple angles by the P-06 or Drakon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Console Weapon Balance

In contrast, weapon balance on consoles is considered "on point" and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Most console players believe sniper rifles are balanced and not a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This highlights a clear [[comparison_of_pc_and_console_versions | difference between the PC and console versions]] of the game regarding weapon dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Root Cause: Console Optimization

The primary reason these weapons are problematic on PC is that they were optimized for console player usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This suggests a broader issue of [[game_optimization_issues_on_different_platforms | game optimization issues on different platforms]], where a balance designed for one platform doesn't translate effectively to another due to differing input methods, player behaviors, and hardware.

## Proposed Solution: Dedicated PC Optimization

To resolve these [[black_ops_3_weapon_balance_issues_on_pc | Black Ops 3 weapon balance issues on PC]], the speaker proposes that Treyarch implement [[need_for_dedicated_weapon_balancing_for_pc | dedicated weapon balancing for PC]] players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This would involve specific weapon statistics and optimization unique to the PC community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The speaker believes this is a "simple concept" that should not be difficult for developers to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The goal is to improve the [[pc_versus_console_gameplay_performance | PC versus console gameplay performance]] and foster a more varied and enjoyable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

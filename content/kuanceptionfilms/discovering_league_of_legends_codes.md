The opening of a "Yu-Gi-Oh full deck box," initially found at a Walmart, revealed unexpected contents beyond collectible cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The box, humorously described as looking like an egg carton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> and having "fermented" for about two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, yielded a surprise.

## Unexpected [[league_of_legends | League of Legends]] Discoveries

Among the items found inside were several [[league_of_legends | League of Legends]] codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. These codes are intended for acquiring "RP" (Riot Points), which is in-game currency for [[league_of_legends | League of Legends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The video host noted that there were "many of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

A specific blue [[league_of_legends | League of Legends]] RP card was also identified, valued at either 10 or 25 RP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. In a jocular demonstration, it was claimed that placing this card on top of other items in the "Yu-Gi-Oh battle arena" would instantly win the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Conception Films, a fan of content creator Drifter, created a video montage inspired by Drifter's "EXO Shield inep" video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Inspiration and "Becoming the Turtle"

Drifter's "EXO Shield inep" video specifically motivated Conception Films to "become the turtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This concept involves adopting a defensive, turtle-like playstyle in the game Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Video Purpose

The video serves as a montage showcasing Conception Films' "greatest moments while being the turtle" in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It is intended as a tribute to Drifter, with a request for viewers to share it with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

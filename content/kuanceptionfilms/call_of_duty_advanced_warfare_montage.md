This video features an introductory sequence and musical accompaniment, typical elements found in a montage. The sequence begins with an "ignition sequence start" countdown, progressing from 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is followed by music that continues throughout the segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The lyrics within the music include phrases like "step out and look around Beauty and still in every little piece inside you see it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> and "don't let them tell you any differently see the light it all begins feeling the fire burning with it Stop The World from giving in tonight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The audio track repeats similar lyrical sections later in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This format is consistent with a montage for a game like [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Call of Duty Advanced Warfare]].

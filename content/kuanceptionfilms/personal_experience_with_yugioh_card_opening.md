This video marks his first [[YuGiOh Trading Card Game Opening | Yu-Gi-Oh!]] content in a while, and the first [[YuGiOh Trading Card Game Opening | Yu-Gi-Oh!]] product he has handled in two to three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Initial Impressions and Expectations
Victor notes that the *Premium Gold: Infinite Gold* box art this year appears "quite red" and "very royal," departing from the "infinite gold" aesthetic suggested by the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. He expresses excitement, describing *Premium Gold* as "very exciting every year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

His primary goal for this [[YuGiOh Trading Card Game Opening | opening]] is to pull "great reprints," specifically mentioning "dank Exceeds card[s]," "dank Pendulum reprints," "good Kozmo cards," and "nice Trap cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He specifically hopes for cards like Mass Change and Monarch Stormforth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He also looks forward to pulling Gagaga Cowboy, Mass Change, and Kozmo Dark Destroyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Victor acknowledges that Konami's reprints can impact the market value of current cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## The Opening Process
The "dank box" opened by Victor contains three packs, with each pack holding five cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He appreciates the gold aesthetic of the cards, stating, "all the cards go really really really nice to pull all that gold is nice AF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

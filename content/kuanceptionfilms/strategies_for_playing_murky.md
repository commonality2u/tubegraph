This article details [[strategies_for_playing_ekko | strategies for playing]] the character Murky, based on a full game commentary provided by a player experienced with the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The commentary emphasizes a no-editing approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, offering an unadulterated look at live gameplay.

## Player's Background with Murky

The commentator considers himself a decent Murky player, having played approximately 39 games with the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. At the time of recording, the player had a record of 26 wins and 13 losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> and was around level 8 with Murky, nearing level 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Murky's Playstyle Philosophy

The player's Murky playstyle is characterized by a balance of objective play and significant lane pushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The primary goal for each game is to achieve at least 100,000 siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, which is considered a realistic target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. While some Murky players might prefer a "suicidal" playstyle, the commentator favors staying alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, despite Murky's ability to quickly respawn from his egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Murky Builds and Abilities

The preferred build for Murky is the [[murkys_bubble_build | bubble build]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, also referred to as "bubble old Murky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This build focuses on maximizing the use of Murky's bubble ability (Safety Bubble) for both offense and defense.

Key abilities and talents:
*   **Bubble Breeze (Level 1)**: Chosen for the [[murkys_bubble_build | bubble build]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Initially, the player would take "bribe," but determined that "bubble build" is the superior choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Envenom (Level 7)**: This talent complements an "assassin" playstyle, allowing Murky to eliminate enemies who attempt to stop his pushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Compressed Air (Level 13)**: Crucial for "super siege," allowing Murky to hit multiple towers or an entire base structure with a single puffer fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Rejuvenating Bubble (Level 16)**: Part of the [[murkys_bubble_build | bubble build]], offering substantial healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Octo-Grab (Ultimate)**: A powerful ability for securing kills or disrupting enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It has an incredibly low cooldown (45-52 seconds) for such a powerful ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>.

Murky does not use mana, allowing for continuous spamming of abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## In-Game Tactics and Execution

### Egg Placement
Strategic egg placement is vital for quick respawns. The player places the egg in discreet locations, such as behind a fort where it's difficult for enemies to spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Bubble Usage
The bubble (Safety Bubble) is Murky's primary survival tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. It should be used almost always if the enemy has crowd control like knock-ups or snares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Effective bubble usage requires good reaction times and knowledge of enemy abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

### Combo Attacks
A common combo for Murky is the Q-W-ultimate-death combo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, or generally "Q-W-bubble" for burst damage and escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The shark ultimate (Octo-Grab) followed by puffer fish and slime can deal massive damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

### Health Regeneration
Murky's health regeneration is notably strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, particularly when returning to the "sippy cup" (fountain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Taking "Sippy Cup" (Level 4) offers a little more health regen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Pushing and Siege Damage
*   **Prioritize Siege Damage**: The main objective is to push lanes and destroy structures, aiming for over 100,000 siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **Targeting Structures**: Utilize abilities like puffer fish (especially with Compressed Air) to damage multiple towers at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Minion Waves**: Dropping puffer fish on minion waves can deal significant damage and clear them quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## [[map_strategies_and_player_tactics | Map Strategies]]

On the "Battlefield of Eternity" map, which has only two lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>, Murky's primary role is still pushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. While Murky typically doesn't focus heavily on objectives on other maps, the player notes a willingness to engage with immortals on this specific map while still prioritizing lane pushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Murky is often sent to the bot lane, making it his "home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Matchups

Murky is considered very good against specific heroes:
*   Kael'thas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>
*   Jaina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>
*   Kerrigan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>
*   Nova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>
*   Illidan (though he's a duelist, Murky can contend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>

Enemies who do not know how to play against Murky are easily defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.# Strategies for Playing Murky

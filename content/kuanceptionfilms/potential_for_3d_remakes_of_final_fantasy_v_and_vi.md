## History of Final Fantasy Handheld Remakes

    *   Final Fantasy 3 is considered by some to be the most underrated and neglected Final Fantasy game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
    *   Final Fantasy 4 is one of the most widely praised and loved Final Fantasy titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   The DS remake of Final Fantasy 3 features a beautifully animated opening cutscene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   The DS remake of Final Fantasy 4 also includes an epic opening cutscene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

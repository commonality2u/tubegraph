The PC beta of *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* experienced significant performance and optimization challenges, leading to widespread issues with lag and connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These problems impacted the overall gameplay experience for many PC players, even those with capable hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The game was noted for running "terribly" on PC, even on a 750 Ti graphics card, which the commentator states is not outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Although frame rates could be consistent when recording gameplay with Fraps, there were frequent "huge drops" in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The game did not feel well-[[pc_gaming_optimization_issues_in_black_ops_3 | optimized for PC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, a disappointment given that *Call of Duty* was historically a PC-exclusive franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Previous *Call of Duty* titles like *Modern Warfare 3* and *Black Ops 2* felt "all right" on PC in terms of optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, *Black Ops 1* and *Ghosts* were described as poorly optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The *Black Ops 3* beta on PC continued this trend, not "looking ideal" or "very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The experience was painful for [[black_ops_3_beta_pc_performance_issues | PC players]] due to the lack of [[pc_gaming_optimization_issues_in_black_ops_3 | optimization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Players without a "killer machine" were predicted to experience lag and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | Console vs. PC Experience]]

In stark contrast to the PC beta, the PlayStation 4 beta of *Black Ops 3* offered a "great fun" and "amazing" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The game was considered "really fun on the consoles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This difference highlighted the [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | optimization disparity]] between platforms during the beta phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | Other PC-Specific Problems]]

Beyond lag, some [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC players]] encountered issues preventing them from playing at all. One friend downloaded the beta but somehow received the wrong version, preventing the game from working or connecting to servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This type of problem was deemed unacceptable and should not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Audio Quality

Despite the performance issues, the [[audio_quality_in_black_ops_3 | audio quality]] in the *Black Ops 3* beta was praised as "amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Outlook

It was hoped that the issues experienced in the [[black_ops_3_beta_pc_performance_issues | beta]] would be resolved by the time of the game's full release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Developers, Treyarch, were called upon to optimize the game for PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

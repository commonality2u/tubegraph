Challenges encountered during [[gameplay experience | gameplay experience]] can include strategic difficulties, [[performance_issues_in_gaming | performance issues]], and the dynamic nature of online interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Strategic and Team Challenges
Players face the challenge of coordinating with teammates, as issues with organization can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Strategic planning for the "late game" is also a consideration, with players speculating on the effectiveness of certain builds or tactics, such as stacking "titles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. An objective involving "testing the dragon" presents a specific in-game challenge requiring collective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Performance Issues
During gameplay, players can experience [[performance_issues_in_gaming | FPS drops]], which hinder the smooth functioning of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## In-Game Reactions and Scenarios
Moments of unexpected difficulty or failure are common, as indicated by exclamations like "oh crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Players might find themselves in situations where they "can't run" or "can't hide," suggesting being cornered or overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. There can also be humorous or exasperated [[reaction_to_video_games | reactions to video games]] before a match even begins, such as commenting on character roles or appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

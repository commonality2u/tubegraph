Welcome to the [[league_of_legends | League of Legends]] champions dank light series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. [[league_of_legends | League of Legends]] is a game where players can utilize various champions with unique abilities and playstyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Featured Champion: Echo, The Boy Who Shattered Time

Echo is presented as a "daredevil genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> who uses his inventions to survive and thrive on the "corrupted streets" of Zaun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Echo's Abilities

*   **Resonance (Implied)**: Triggering resonance on an enemy champion applies extra damage and a slow effect, and also grants Echo a "briefie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **W - Parallel Convergence**: This ability has both passive and active components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    *   **Passive**: Echo's basic attacks deal additional magic damage to low health enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Phase Dive (Movement Ability)**: Echo can pass through terrain using both parts of his Phase Dive ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **R - Chrono Break (Ultimate Ability)**: When Echo uses Chrono Break, he briefly becomes untargetable and invulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Upon reappearing, he heals based on the amount of punishment he has taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Gameplay Mechanics and Strategies for Echo

Echo utilizes a significant amount of crowd control and other tools alongside his standard attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, such as stuns and snares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

#### Engaging and Disengaging
A common strategy involves engaging an isolated enemy and quickly disengaging before the enemy team can react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This involves using abilities to get in, secure a kill, and get out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

#### Combo Example
One combo involves positioning an enemy into a slowing zone, then using Chrono Break to re-enter the zone and potentially stun them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Without vision, enemies might walk directly into Echo's stun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

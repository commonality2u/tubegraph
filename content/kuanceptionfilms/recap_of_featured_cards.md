The opened Value Cube contained a "Fairy" structure deck, two booster packs, and a promo pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The "Fairy" structure deck's online price was noted to be higher than the Value Cube's cost of $9.99, likely due to a lack of reprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Promo Pack Highlights

The promo pack was sourced from Legendary Collection 5Ds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Notable cards from this pack included:
*   Shooting Quasar Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> (described as "very strong") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   Fenrir the Nordic Wolf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, also referred to as "Nordic move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
*   Stardust Splash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>
*   Black Rose Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>
*   Nordic Serpent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>

These cards were considered "pretty good reprints" and contributed to the "pretty good value cube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Booster Pack Contents

The two booster packs opened were "Return of the Duels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> and "Judgment of the Light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   From "Return of the Duels," a Spellbook of Wisdom common card was noted, with the pack yielding only commons and rares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. There was a hope for Excalibur or Champion Excalibur from this pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   The "Judgment of the Light" pack also contained only commons and rares, including an "Aldo Che Chicka Lates" card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   A "Lost Chapter of the Noble Knights" pack was also present, which "looks really cool" and comes with a Noble Knights structure deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. A Noble Knight gold rare card was obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
The overall pulls from these booster packs were described as "pretty weak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

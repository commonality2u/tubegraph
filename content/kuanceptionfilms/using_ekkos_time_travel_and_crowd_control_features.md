[[introduction_to_ekko_as_a_league_of_legends_champion | Ekko]], known as "the boy who shattered time," is a daredevil genius who uses his inventions to survive and thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. His kit includes various [[ekkos_abilities_and_gameplay_mechanics | abilities and gameplay mechanics]] that involve both temporal manipulation and potent [[Chain CC Mechanics in League of Legends | crowd control]].

## Ekko's Time Travel: Chrono Break

Ekko's ultimate ability, Chrono Break, offers significant utility and survivability.
When activated, Ekko briefly turns untargetable and invulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Upon reappearing, he heals based on the amount of punishment he has taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This ability allows Ekko to "time travel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Crowd Control in Ekko's Kit

Ekko possesses a variety of crowd control tools that can be used alongside his standard attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

*   **Resonance**: Triggering resonance on an enemy champion applies extra damage and a slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
*   **Parallel Convergence (W)**: This ability can result in stuns, snares, or bolos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Opponents without vision can walk directly into the stun zone of Parallel Convergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Strategic Combinations and Engagements

Ekko's abilities allow for aggressive engages and evasive maneuvers, making him adept at picking off isolated targets.

*   **Target Isolation**: When spotting an enemy positioned away from their team, Ekko can "get in, kill him, and get out before the enemy team can react" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
*   **Chrono Break with Crowd Control**: A powerful [[strategic_tips_for_playing_ekko_effectively | combo]] involves using Chrono Break in conjunction with his slowing zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. For example, as an enemy team moves through a slowing zone, Ekko can use Chrono Break to reposition himself back into the zone, allowing for further engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

This article details the contents, quality, and [[comparing_value_cube_packs | value]] of various Yu-Gi-Oh! card packs, including [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Structure Decks]], booster packs, and promo packs, based on a specific [[unboxing_and_rare_cards | unboxing]].

## Value Cube Contents and Value

A specific "Value Cube" contains a 40-card deck along with 25 cards, including booster packs and five foil cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This particular Value Cube was purchased from Target for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> and came with the Fairy [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Structure Deck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The Value Cubes are considered to offer good [[comparing_value_cube_packs | value]] because the $9.99 price point is comparable to just a [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Structure Deck]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This means purchasers are "plussing" by also receiving two booster packs and a promo pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The Fairy [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Structure Deck]] itself was noted to be more expensive online than the Value Cube's price, due to a lack of [[discussion_of_reprints_in_the_structure_deck | reprints]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The contents of the Value Cube included:
*   The Fairy [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Structure Deck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   A promo pack from Legendary Collection 5D's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   A booster pack of *Judgment of the Light* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   A booster pack of *Return of the Duels* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>

Additionally, the packaging included styrofoam filler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## [[opening_yugioh_card_packs | Opening Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Packs]]

Some packs and decks were difficult to open:
*   The *Judgment of the Light* pack was accidentally ripped open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   The Fairy [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Structure Deck]] was particularly challenging to open, described as "a pain in the arse" and the "most painful thing" to open on the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

One pack, *Judgment of the Light*, was observed to be "smashed up" but the cards inside were hoped not to be damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Card Pulls and Quality

### Booster Pack Pulls
*   **Return of the Duels:** This pack yielded only commons and rares, with a hopeful pull for "Balling Excalibur" or "Champion Excalibur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Judgment of the Light:** This pack also resulted in only commons and rares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

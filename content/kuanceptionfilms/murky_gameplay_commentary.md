This [[video_game_commentary | video game commentary]] features a full match of gameplay as the character Murky in an unspecified game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The commentary covers the entire game without any editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

The commentator identifies as a "pretty decent Murky" player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, having played approximately 39 games with the character and achieved a record of 26 wins and 13 losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Murky is currently at level 8, nearing level 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The commentator also mentions being a "masters" player with Murky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Murky Gameplay Strategy

The gameplay takes place on the "Battlefield of Eternity," a map that has been out for a few weeks at the time of the video's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The commentator's Murky playstyle is described as "a little bit objective but mostly pushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The primary goal for every game is to achieve at least 100,000 siege damage, which is considered a realistic target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Build and Abilities

The chosen build for Murky is the "bubble build" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, also referred to as "bubble bubble old Murky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This build focuses on maximizing the use of Murky's bubble ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Key abilities and talents mentioned in this [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky gameplay]]:
*   **Bubble Breeze (Level 1 Talent)**: Chosen early in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The commentator initially thought "bribe" was the best talent for Murky but later determined "bubble build" to be superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Egg Placement**: Strategically placed where it cannot be easily seen by opponents, such as behind a fort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   **Health Regeneration**: Murky's health regeneration, especially from the "sippy cup" (fountain), has been significantly buffed and is "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Staying Alive**: Unlike "suicidal Murky" players, the commentator prefers to stay alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   Players should almost always have their bubble ready, especially if enemies have knock-up or snare abilities, to ensure survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Envenom (Level 4 Talent)**: Chosen for assassin capabilities against "squishy" enemy team compositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Murky Combo**: Refers to the Q (Pufferfish) + W (Slime) + Octo-Grab (Ultimate) combo, which can result in "amazing burst" damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Move Speed (Level 7 Talent)**: Picking up the 20% move speed bonus helps prevent enemies from walking with and killing Murky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Compressed Air (Level 7 Talent)**: Selected for "maximum siege" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, allowing Pufferfish to hit all towers at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, and clear an entire base section with one Pufferfish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Octo-Grab (Ultimate)**: The ultimate ability which allows for "really good things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> and has an "incredibly low" cooldown (around 45-52 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>.
*   **Rejuvenating Bubble (Level 16 Talent)**: Part of the chosen bubble build, providing healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, which is described as "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
*   **Slimey Pufferfish**: An alternative talent that creates a slime at the Pufferfish location for increased damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Shark Ultimate**: A powerful attack that can deal approximately 300 damage per whack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

### General Gameplay Principles

*   Murky does not use mana, allowing for liberal use of Q and W abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Despite dying frequently (the commentator dies twice by 22:26 and notes a "very frequent base" of dying by 24:15), the impact of dying is minimized due to Murky's unique mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>, though the commentator believes it still matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   The commentator prefers to push lanes and destroy forts, considering it a "main goal as a siege Murky player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, even if it means neglecting objectives initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.
*   Good reaction times are crucial for effective bubble usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   Murky is considered very good against specific heroes like Kael'thas, Jaina, Kerrigan, Nova, and Illidan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

### Commentary Style

The commentary includes informal remarks and observations during gameplay:
*   Mentions having "puddin" (pudding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Complains about daily quests for support heroes since Murky is the only character played <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Expresses frustration with a chipped spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Uses descriptive, informal language like "splooge" for ability effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Refers to enemy players as "idiot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a> and "dick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   Acknowledges a win by stating they "would not upload this if we lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   Celebrates achievements such as a "double kill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> and "triple whammy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   Ends the game with 125,000 siege damage, which is considered "fine on a two-lane map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>, and celebrates with "victory pudding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

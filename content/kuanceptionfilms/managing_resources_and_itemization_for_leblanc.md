### Itemization

Upon starting a game, players are advised to purchase a "hexagonal nut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. For the first return to base, it is suggested to acquire the "spooky mask" and the "star root wand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These particular items are said to provide true damage that scales with the amount of gold a player possesses at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Resource Management

Resource management for [[understanding_leblancs_abilities | LeBlanc]] in this guide is described with an emphasis on unconventional tactics:
*   **Minions**
    *   Players are encouraged to intentionally miss every single minion in lane, as this action is humorously stated to provide "motivation to farm kills later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   It is also mentioned that a "cinch" (possibly referring to a teammate or specific game mechanic) should "steal every godamn super minion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Blue Buff**
    *   When taking the jungler's blue buff, the process should be completed rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The advice regarding resource management and itemization for [[understanding_leblancs_abilities | LeBlanc]] in this guide is generally presented satirically, favoring an aggressive, kill-oriented playstyle over traditional farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Montages often incorporate a distinct musical and lyrical component to set the tone and convey a message. They can feature motivational lyrics, such as "Beauty and still in every little pece inside you see it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, and "don't let them tell you any differently see the light it all begins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

A recurring theme in the accompanying audio for a montage can be one of empowerment and overcoming challenges, as indicated by phrases like "feeling the fire burning with it Stop The World from giving in tonight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This specific line is repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, suggesting its importance to the overall message or emotional arc of the [[montage_of_call_of_duty_advanced_warfare_gameplay | montage]].

The beginning of a [[lucian_montage | montage]] may also include a countdown or "ignition sequence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, signaling the start of the compilation.

The rhythm game Osu! often incorporates elements of internet "dank meme" culture, particularly through custom [[osu_game_skins | game skins]] and music choices.

## Meme-Themed Skins
Players can use custom [[osu_game_skins | skins]] that feature popular internet memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. One example mentioned is a "dank skin" where the icons are "literally weed" and the circles are designed as "weed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

A specific [[osu_game_skins | skin]] called "Twitch Chat" was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This [[osu_game_skins | skin]] features "Pepe with a c in the middle" for every circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and the skip button features the "dancing kid" meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Players may also request such [[osu_game_skins | skins]] from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Meme Music
"Dank remixes" of well-known songs can also be featured in Osu!. An example is a "Dank remix of Darude Sandstorm" played at the end of a map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

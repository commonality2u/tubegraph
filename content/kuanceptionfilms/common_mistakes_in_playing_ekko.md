Based on observations, certain approaches to playing [[Ekko Character Overview | Ekko]], "the boy who shattered time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, are considered incorrect.

## General Misplays
A direct statement indicates that "this is how to not play" [[Ekko Character Overview | Ekko]], and that "by playing [[Ekko Character Overview | Ekko]] you are playing him wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## Lack of Vision
A significant misstep is attempting to engage without proper vision. Although enemies might occasionally stumble into [[Abilities and Mechanics of Ekko | Ekko's stun]] by chance, playing "without vision" is considered a novice mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

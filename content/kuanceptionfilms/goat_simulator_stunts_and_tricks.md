Goat Simulator is a [[hilarious_pc_games | hilarious PC game]] where players can perform a variety of stunts and engage in widespread destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The [[goat_simulator_gameplay | gameplay]] is characterized by its physics-based chaos, allowing for numerous [[funny_moments_in_gaming | funny moments]].

## Core Stunts and Actions

Many actions in the game revolve around the goat's unique [[game_mechanics_and_controls | mechanics]] and abilities:

*   **Wrecking Things** The primary objective often involves "wrecking a bunch of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This includes vehicles, objects, and even people, with the narrator frequently exclaiming "Get Wrecked!" during destructive sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Tongue Abilities** The goat's tongue is a key tool for interaction. It can be used to:
    *   **Drag Cars** Players can use their "invincible tongue" to drag cars around the map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   **Grab Objects** Even large objects like stop signs can be picked up and dragged with the tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   **Interact with NPCs** The tongue can be used to "drag" non-player characters (NPCs), prompting reactions such as asking for help with Doritos or being dragged away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   **Destroy Vehicles** A single "lick with a goat can destroy a whole car," highlighting the exaggerated nature of the game's physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Advanced Maneuvers and Achievements

Beyond basic destruction, players can attempt more complex feats:

*   **Aerial Spins** The goat can perform spins in the air, referred to as "360" maneuvers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Dangerous Tricks** Players can engage in "dangerous tricks" that might involve falling or risky navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Becoming King of All Goats** A notable achievement in the game is proclaiming oneself "king of all goats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This often involves reaching specific locations or completing in-game challenges, and it might unlock cosmetic items like a "sexy helmet" to "rule the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

The game is praised for defining "the future" and being "really awesome" due to its unique and chaotic approach to gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

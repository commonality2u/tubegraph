Osu! players frequently encounter various [[gaming_challenges | challenges]] and unique experiences within the game, ranging from understanding [[gameplay_terminology_and_mechanics_in_osu | gameplay mechanics]] to dealing with technical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Gameplay Mechanics and Terminology

The game involves various mechanics such as "stream" and "crossmap jumps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Players also discuss [[gameplay_terminology_and_mechanics_in_osu | visual elements]] like "Kappa" which can be associated with the "skip button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Rank and Progression

Understanding rank progression in Osu! can be a point of discussion. Players debate the terminology for moving up or down in rank, such as "going up in rank" meaning progression towards rank one, or "minus" signifying a fall in rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. A thousand PP (Performance Points) used to place a player at roughly 70,000th rank, but this has shifted, with that same PP value now corresponding to around 113,000th rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Scoring and Accuracy

The score display in Osu! includes elements like "fixers" and multipliers such as "x7" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. [[improving_performance_and_accuracy_in_osu | Accuracy]] is a key metric, with a high accuracy indicating strong performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Players strive for better accuracy, noting that hitting more notes improves their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Achieving over one million points can be a benchmark for a successful run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Gameplay Challenges

### Difficulty and Map Selection
Players often [[starting_with_difficult_osu_maps | play very hard songs]] as a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Some use difficult songs specifically to compete against friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Missing jumps and other elements are common difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. There can also be confusion if a player is on a different map version than others, which can make synchronous play challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Technical Issues
Players sometimes experience lag during [[gameplay_experience | gameplay]], which can hinder their ability to see all on-screen elements or perform optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Lag can lead to missing jumps and ultimately affect overall performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

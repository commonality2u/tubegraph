The servers for *Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare* (CoD 4) on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are described as "broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Gameplay footage shows an example of a "Hacked Lobby gameplay," illustrating the severe issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite CoD 4 being considered "the purest and arguably the best Call of Duty game," the developers at Infinity Ward are stated to "basically don't give a crap about the conditions of its servers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Impact of Server Issues

It is nearly impossible to find a playable lobby in CoD 4 due to the widespread presence of hackers, boosters, and other forms of "BS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This means players can no longer enjoy the classic *Call of Duty* multiplayer experience on these older titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Affected Games

The severe server conditions are not limited to CoD 4. Similar problems plague *Modern Warfare 2* and *World at War*, both of which were acclaimed for their multiplayer experiences but are now unplayable due to the prevalence of [[impact_of_hackers_on_call_of_duty_games | hackers]] and boosters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Player Response and Alternatives

Due to the poor conditions of these older game servers, players are forced to migrate to newer titles like *Black Ops 2* or *Modern Warfare 3* to find a stable online experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While *Black Ops 2* was initially considered fun, players are growing tired of it, especially after experiences with games like *Call of Duty: Ghosts*, which reportedly no one played continuously for more than two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. There is also uncertainty regarding upcoming titles like [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Advanced Warfare]], with concerns it might follow the disappointing trend of *Call of Duty: Ghosts* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Proposal for a Remaster

A proposed solution to these issues is an HD remaster of CoD 4 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Such a remaster would feature enhanced graphics and, crucially, "brand new and playable" servers free from [[impact_of_hackers_on_call_of_duty_games | hackers]] and other disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Given the widespread love for [[popularity_and_legacy_of_call_of_duty_4 | Call of Duty 4]] among fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, it is suggested that it could be released digitally, followed a year later by a *Modern Warfare 2* HD remaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Potential Impact of Remasters
While this proposal is seen as a "great idea," it acknowledges that a [[call_of_duty_4_remastered_for_ps4_and_xbox_one | Call of Duty 4 remaster]] could potentially divert sales from [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Advanced Warfare]] and other [[future_possibilities_for_call_of_duty_franchises | future Call of Duty games]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

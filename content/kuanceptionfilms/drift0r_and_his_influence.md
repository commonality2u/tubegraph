## Inspiration for "Becoming the Turtle"

One of Drift0r's videos, specifically his "EXO Shield inep video," stood out to a fan and inspired them to adopt a particular playstyle known as "becoming the turtle" in *Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This inspiration led to the creation of a montage showcasing "greatest moments" while playing in this inspired manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

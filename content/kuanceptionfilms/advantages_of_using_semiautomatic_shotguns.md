Semiautomatic shotguns, exemplified by the "Brecci" in *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3*, offer distinct advantages in gameplay, particularly on PC.

## Overview of the Brecci Shotgun

The Brecci is described as a semi-automatic shotgun in *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It is considered arguably the best shotgun, and potentially even the best gun, in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It is widely regarded as "very OP" (overpowered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Key Advantages

*   **Ease of Use for New Players**
    The Brecci is noted for being incredibly forgiving, allowing even new players to perform well. Any "noob" can pick up this gun and "do the tanking," suggesting a low skill floor for effective use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Its ease of use is particularly apparent when playing against less experienced players, such as "Christmas noobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   **Effectiveness in Rushing Playstyle**
    The shotgun is highly effective for aggressive "rushing" tactics, allowing players to move quickly around maps and engage enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This can lead to achieving "dank streaks" in gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

*   **Enhanced Performance on PC**
    The Brecci particularly benefits players on PC, especially due to higher frame rates like 120 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This suggests that [[comparison_of_weapon_optimization_between_pc_and_console | weapon optimization]] can differ significantly between platforms, with PC players potentially gaining an advantage with certain weapon types.

## Typical Usage and Context

Gameplay footage featuring the Brecci is often showcased on smaller maps like Nuketown and Combine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It is also frequently used in modes like Chaos Mosh Pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Balance Concerns
> The Brecci's effectiveness has led to calls for it to be "nerfed" (have its power reduced) due to its perceived overpowered nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

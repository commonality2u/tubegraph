"Fermenting" YuGiOh decks is a unique, experimental method used by creator Seth from Conception Films to potentially increase the rarity and value of cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This process involves allowing a sealed YuGiOh deck box to sit for extended periods, with the expectation that it will yield more valuable or rare items over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Initial Fermentation Process

The experiment began with a rare YuGiOh full deck box, specifically a Warlock Burst Set deck, found at Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The creator allowed this box to "ferment" for approximately two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The initial results of this process included:
*   League of Legends RP codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   A "full deck" of six [[collecting_ultra_rare_yugioh_cards | ultra rare YuGiOh cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Initial Card Discoveries

The cards obtained from the first fermentation were described as very rare and difficult to find in stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. These included:
*   An "ultra ultra rare YuGiOh card" featuring Charizard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Another Charizard card, described as "very very good" and shiny, in mint condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   A "dark dug trio" card, which was dismissed as "a piece of crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   A yellow card resembling Raichu, believed to be Japanese and described as a "double card" or "two face card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   Multiple "Level X" cards, which the creator noted were promised by the pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Another "two face card" that was deemed "magnificent" but ultimately "sucks complete crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Subsequent Fermentation Attempts

The creator continued the fermentation process, hoping for even more valuable returns, as he intended to [[value_and_rarity_of_yugioh_cards | sell these cards]] since he does not play YuGiOh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Second Fermentation Results

After letting the box sit for another two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, the fermentation yielded a "UVO starter booster pack" featuring tempera paint in five colors: green, blue, red, white, and yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This was not what the creator was looking for, as he desired more legendaries with high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Third Fermentation Results

The box was then left to ferment for "a couple weeks" more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, resulting in the "panda bundle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This bundle included:
*   Three rare panda figurines, which the creator stated he collects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   A traditional bumblebee panda with black stripes, ears, and raccoon-like eye circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   An "ultra rare" panda figurine, noted to be broken but still exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This figurine was estimated to be sellable for about two cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   A small but "mighty powerful" panda figurine capable of clearing the entire YuGiOh battle arena of cards, figurines, wax figures, and bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This effect, combined with a blue League of Legends RP card, was humorously stated to win the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Final Outcome

After hearing that the "panda set" was followed by the most rare set possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, the creator left the box to ferment for an "exonerable amount of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. However, the experiment ultimately "failed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The final draw did not yield any legendary or valuable cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, with the resulting cards being described as "pieces of crap" and "completely worthless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The creator concluded that the draws were getting "crappier and crappier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

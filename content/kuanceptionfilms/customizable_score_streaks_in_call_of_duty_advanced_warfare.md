In [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Call of Duty Advanced Warfare]], score streaks can be customized from the "Create a Custom Class" menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. While the game's score streaks are generally considered "very underpowered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, the ability to customize them is a notable feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Customization Options

Players can add various modifiers to their score streaks:
*   **Speed** (e.g., to a UAV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>
*   **Extra assist points** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>
*   **Extra time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   **Scrambler** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
*   **Enemy Direction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   **Threat detection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   **Orbital** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
*   **Support** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

Additionally, the "Orbital Care Package" has many customization options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Overall Assessment

Despite the interesting customization feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, most score streaks in the game are considered "very underpowered" or "kind of petty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Popular choices for use typically include the UAV, the turret, and sometimes the system hack or bombing run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Impact on Content Production

## Resolution

The immediate issue was resolved by Seth, the co-owner of the channel, who lent his Elgato game capture to Victor, enabling him to record a Grand Theft Auto V [[video_game_commentary | gameplay commentary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The channel produces [[video_game_commentary | gameplay commentaries]] for games like Grand Theft Auto V, Call of Duty, Yu-Gi-Oh, and OSU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

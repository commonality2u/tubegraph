Osu! features various game mechanics and strategies that players utilize to improve their performance and ranking.

## Gameplay Elements
Players engage with several core elements during gameplay:
*   **Songs/Maps** Players engage with various "songs" or "maps," which dictate the rhythm and patterns of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. There might be different maps available for the same song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Jumps** A common element in Osu! gameplay involves hitting "jumps," which are notes that appear at a distance from each other, requiring quick movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Successfully hitting all jumps is crucial for a good score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, while missing them impacts performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Streams** Another key element is "stream crossmap jumps," which combine continuous sequences of notes ("streams") with "jumps" across the play area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Scoring and [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | Ranking]]
Osu! uses several metrics to determine player performance and [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | ranking]]:
*   **Accuracy** A critical component of scoring is high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Players' accuracy, such as 83% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> or 92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, directly impacts their score.
*   **Points Multipliers** During gameplay, various multipliers like "x7" or "x8" appear under players' names, indicating score bonuses for successful combos and hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Performance Points (PP)** Players earn Performance Points (PP), which contribute to their global [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | rank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **[[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | Rank]] Movement** Discussions about [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | rank]] indicate that a "plus [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | rank]]" means going up, while "minus [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | rank]]" means falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. "Gaining [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | rank]]" or "going up in [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | rank]]" signifies progress towards [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | rank]] one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, while "falling down" means decreasing [[ranking_and_scoring_in_osu | rank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Strategies and Tactics
*   **Choosing Difficulty** A common strategy is to "play a really hard song" to challenge oneself and potentially improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Some players use this tactic to compete against others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Using the Skip Button** The game includes a "skip button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, though its exact function (e.g., skipping intros or breaks) is not detailed.
*   **Visual Customization** Players can customize their game experience with [[osu_game_skins | Osu game skins]], which may include elements like a "Kappa" cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. These visual elements can interact with gameplay, such as a "Kappa" that spins the player instead of spinning itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

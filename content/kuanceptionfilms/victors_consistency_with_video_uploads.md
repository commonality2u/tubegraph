Victor, from [[kuanceptionfilms_video_production | KuanCeptionFILMS video production]], discusses his video upload consistency, especially concerning his [[yugioh_channel_engagement_and_community | Yu-Gi-Oh!]] content.

## Upload Schedule and Activity
Victor states that he offers "dank Yu-Gi-Oh! videos" on a weekly basis, uploading about twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. He considers this "pretty consistent" for a busy student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Reasons for Inactivity
Victor acknowledges that he had not been very active with Yu-Gi-Oh! content on YouTube for a few weeks prior to the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The primary reason for this reduced activity was being "very very busy with school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, specifically mentioning the intensity of "AP classes in high school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. He expressed a desire to show his active subscribers and Yu-Gi-Oh! community that he is still around and dedicated to making videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

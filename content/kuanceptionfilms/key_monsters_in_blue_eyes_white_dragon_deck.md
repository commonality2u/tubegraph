## Main Deck Monsters

### Core Blue-Eyes Support

*   **Blue-Eyes White Dragon**
    The central monster of the deck, three copies are essential as it is the primary monster relied upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Maiden with Eyes of Blue**
    Considered the "MVP" of the deck, three copies of this one-star tuner are included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Its effect allows a Blue-Eyes White Dragon to be special summoned to the field whenever Maiden is targeted by an effect or attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **White Stone of Legend**
    Three copies of this card are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It is a great tuner that adds a Blue-Eyes White Dragon to the hand whenever it is sent to the graveyard, which is useful for discarding or milling strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Additional Tuners & Special Summons

*   **Parsec, the Interstellar Dragon**
    One copy is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Its ability allows it to be normal summoned without tributing if a Level 8 monster is controlled, enabling easy Rank 8 Xyz summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

*   **Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon**
    One copy is included due to its powerful ability, which is similar to Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon's effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. It is easy to special summon by removing one Dragon-Type monster from play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Shining Angel**
    Two copies are run to help quickly bring out Maiden with Eyes of Blue if she isn't drawn in the opening hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Honest**
    One copy is included, as it is considered great for any Light-Type deck, and the majority of cards in this [[blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck_profile | Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] build are Light attribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Dagard the Cubic Beast**

*   **Gagaga Magician**
    One copy is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Its effect allows it to declare and become any level from 1 to 8 once per turn, making it very useful for Xyz summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Synchro Monsters

*   **Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon**

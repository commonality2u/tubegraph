The following sections detail the key monster cards included in a 2015 build of this deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Core Monsters

### Blue-Eyes White Dragon
As the namesake of the deck, three copies of [[strategies_for_summoning_and_enhancing_blue_eyes_white_dragon | Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] are essential, as it is the main monster the deck relies on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Maiden with Eyes of Blue
This card is considered the main MVP of the deck, with three copies recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Type:** One-star tuner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Effect:** When targeted by an effect or attacked, it allows you to special summon a Blue-Eyes White Dragon from your hand, deck, or graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Synergy:** Can be easily brought out by cards like Shining Angel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> or One for One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. It also works well with Forbidden Chain to activate its effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> and can be "spammed" with Castle of Dragon Souls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### White Stone of Legend
Three copies are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Type:** Great tuner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Effect:** When sent to the graveyard, it adds a Blue-Eyes White Dragon from your deck to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This is useful for discarding abilities or milling strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Support & Utility Monsters

### Rider of the Storm Winds
Included as an extra tuner with a useful effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Kaibaman
Three copies are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Parsec, the Interstellar Dragon
One copy is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Effect:** If you control a Level 8 monster, you can normal summon this card without tributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This enables easy Rank 8 Xyz summons on the first turn if you can get out a Blue-Eyes White Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Dark Storm Dragon
This card serves as an alternative Level 8 monster in the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Effect:** Has a great effect and is a Gemini monster, meaning it is treated as a Normal Monster on the field or in the graveyard unless its effect is activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon
One copy is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Effect:** Its ability is similar to Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon's and is easy to summon by banishing one Dragon-type monster from play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Shining Angel
Two copies are included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** Helps to bring out Maiden with Eyes of Blue if she's not drawn in the opening hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Honest
One copy is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** Considered great for any Light-type deck, and most cards in the [[blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck_composition | Blue Eyes White Dragon Deck]] are Light attribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Dagard
One copy is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Effect:** Can tribute one monster to change another monster's level to 8, which is great for Level 8 Xyz summoning in this deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Gagaga Magician
One copy is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Effect:** Once per turn, you can declare a level from 1 to 8, and this card becomes that level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This is very useful for Xyz summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Extra Deck Monsters

The [[extra_deck_recommendations_for_blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck | Extra Deck Recommendations for Blue Eyes White Dragon Deck]] includes a variety of Rank 8 Xyz and Synchro monsters to support the main strategy.

### Rank 8 Xyz Monsters
*   **Thunder-End Dragon:** Great ability; once per turn, you can detach one Xyz material to destroy all other monsters on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon:** Has a great effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Can be summoned using two Level 8 monsters, such as two Blue-Eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Hieratic Dragon King of Atum:** A great card for destroying your opponent's monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand:** Great effect; allows you to negate effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Rank 4 Xyz Monster
*   **Queen Dragun Djinn:** Has a good effect for Dragon-type decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Synchro Monsters
*   **Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon:** The MVP of the Extra Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Allows for revival of Blue-Eyes White Dragon and grants protection to Dragon-type monsters summoned on the first turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth:** Functions similarly to a Monster Reborn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Trident Dragion:** Not considered the best card, but can be used with Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon and a White Stone of Legend for potential One-Turn KOs in lucky situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. It is not necessary for the deck's core functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

Victor of Conception Films presents an [[YuGiOh Primal Origin OCG Booster Box Opening | unboxing video]] of a Yu-Gi-Oh! "Less Exel OCG booster box," specifically a Primal Origin Korean OCG booster box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The booster box was given as an early birthday present by Min Soo Kim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. William is also present during the unboxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Opening Goals

The primary goal for this [[Personal Experience with YuGiOh Card Opening | card opening]] is to pull "bujin cards" and "galaxy-eyes photon cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. There is also a hope to pull a "super FML yo" or an "artifact card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## [[Challenges faced during gameplay | Challenges During the Opening]]

The process of opening the booster box presented several challenges:
*   **Box Difficulty** The box was initially "too strong" to open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, with the host stating he "can't seem to open it up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. It took approximately 20 minutes to open the booster box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Pack Count Confusion** It took about seven minutes to determine the correct number of booster packs, which was ultimately found to be 40, not the initially thought 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Pack Quality** The quality of the OCG packs was noted to be "above average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. However, some packs contained "no rares or a hollow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a> or even no "foils or errors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, leading to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Opening Technique** A theory was tested that the way a pack is ripped affects the pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The final pack was opened down the middle in a "very unique way" to find the "best card in the set" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

The quick reload function is one of the interesting features introduced in [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Call of Duty Advanced Warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It offers a faster way to reload a weapon compared to the standard method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## How it Works
Typically, pressing the reload button once initiates a normal reload animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. To perform a quick reload, players must double-tap the reload button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This action causes the magazine to be emptied and reloaded very rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
*   **Advantage**: The primary benefit of the quick reload is its speed, allowing for very rapid reloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This feature is particularly useful during "heated gunfights" where every second counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Disadvantage**: The significant drawback of the quick reload is that all remaining ammunition in the magazine being reloaded is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This aspect is considered more realistic but presents strategic disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Weapon Compatibility
The quick reload function is available for various weapons in the game. Examples include:
*   **IMR**: An assault rifle demonstrated with the quick reload feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **ASM1**: A submachine gun also shown to utilize the quick reload function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The quick reload is noted as a "really cool new function" in [[call_of_duty_advanced_warfare | Call of Duty Advanced Warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

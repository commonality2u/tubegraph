Rank in Osu refers to a player's position on a global leaderboard, often determined by Performance Points (PP) and displayed as a numerical rank (e.g., 'k' for thousands).

## How Rank is Calculated and Displayed
Player rank is influenced by Performance Points (PP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Historically, having 1,000 PP might have placed a player around 70k rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, ranks can change; a player who was 70k might later find themselves at 113k <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Interpreting Rank Numbers
In Osu, a lower numerical rank indicates a better position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   When a player's rank "goes up," it means their rank number decreases towards one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This is akin to climbing a ladder towards the top (rank 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   Conversely, if a player's rank number increases, they are "falling down" in rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Score and Rank
While not explicitly detailed how they affect rank, elements like score multipliers (e.g., "x7 x-lates") contribute to a player's score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. [[improving_performance_and_accuracy_in_osu | Accuracy]] also plays a role, with higher accuracy generally leading to better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Players strive to achieve high scores, aiming for over 1 million points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.# Understanding Rank Definitions in Osu

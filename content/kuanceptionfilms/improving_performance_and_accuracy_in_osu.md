Improving performance and accuracy in Osu involves understanding gameplay mechanics, score calculation, and rank progression, as well as practicing challenging map elements.

## Understanding Rank and Performance Points (PP)

Osu players are ranked based on their Performance Points (PP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Historically, having around 1,000 PP might place a player at approximately rank 70,000, though these rankings can shift, with the same PP value later corresponding to a rank of 113,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

When discussing rank progression:
*   "Gaining rank" or "going up in rank" refers to moving towards rank one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   "Losing rank" or "going down in rank" implies falling to a higher rank number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Gameplay Mechanics and Scoring

In Osu, a player's score is often displayed with elements like "times fixers" (score multipliers) and "x7xlates" (combo multipliers), which contribute to the overall score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. [[gameplay_terminology_and_mechanics_in_osu | Accuracy]] is a critical component of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

There are specific score thresholds, such as not being able to achieve over 1 million points before getting a "P.D." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Achieving a higher accuracy, for instance, 92% compared to 83% or 84%, significantly impacts performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Challenges in Gameplay

Players may encounter various difficulties during gameplay:
*   **Lag**: Gameplay can be affected by lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, which can hinder performance and accuracy.
*   **Jumps**: Missing "jumps" or notes during a song is a common challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Difficult Maps**: Playing "really hard songs" or maps with elements like "stream crossmap jumps" are often used to improve skills and challenge other players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Mastering these elements is key to advancement.

Some players may accidentally play a different map or an older version of a map for a song, which can affect their performance expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Visual Elements and Customization

Some players utilize custom [[osu_skin_features | visual elements]] like a "Kappa" in their Osu skin, which might spin or have other animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. There is also a "skip button" that might appear, which some players prefer not to interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

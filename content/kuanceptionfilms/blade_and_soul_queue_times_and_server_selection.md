[[blade_and_soul_gameplay_overview|Blade and Soul]] is a brand new MMORPG that has been available for just over a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The game has quickly amassed a significant player base, with millions already registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## High Player Volume and Queue Times

Due to the game's popularity, players often face extremely long wait times to enter the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Queue times have been humorously exaggerated to be "a little bit over five billion hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. One anecdote from the video suggests a player who attempted to log in a week prior only just managed to get into the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Exaggeration
> The "five billion hours" and "just got on" statements are acknowledged as exaggerations by the speaker, highlighting the severe, yet anecdotal, nature of the queue times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Server Selection

After completing [[character_customization_in_blade_and_soul|character customization]], players are prompted to choose a server to play on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. At the time of this video, the game was experiencing issues, including instances where the game would stop responding upon attempting to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

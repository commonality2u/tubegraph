Victor of Conception Films presents a [[YuGiOh Trading Card Game Opening | Yugioh]] video featuring the unboxing of a Primal Origin Korean OCG booster box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Acquisition

The booster box was received as an early birthday present from Min Soo Kim, who is described as a "good man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Unboxing Process

The host expresses a desire to pull Bujin cards and Galaxy-Eyes Photon cards from the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The box itself was described as "too strong" and difficult to open, taking about 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Initially, it was thought to contain 24 packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, but it was later confirmed to have 40 booster packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, which took the host approximately seven minutes to figure out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

During the [[Personal Experience with YuGiOh Card Opening | card opening]] process, the host notes the "above average" build quality of the OCG packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. A theory about how ripping the pack affects the pulls was also tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

Despite some packs containing "all commons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a> or "no rares or a hollow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, the host was generally pleased with the pulls.

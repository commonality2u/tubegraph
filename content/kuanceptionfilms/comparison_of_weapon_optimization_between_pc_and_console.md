## The Problem on PC
In *[[Call of Duty console vs PC gameplay | Call of Duty: Black Ops 3]]*, a significant [[weapon_balance_problems_on_pc_vs_console | weapon balance problem]] has emerged within the PC community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. On PC, the Drakon and P06 sniper rifles, along with the Brecci shotgun, are overwhelmingly prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Approximately three-fourths of players in any given PC lobby are observed spamming these weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This overuse of specific weapons creates a lack of variety and predictability in gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, where players frequently face shots from every angle by these dominant guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

> "When you're on PC and everybody is using the Drakon and the P06, you know there's a weapon balance problem." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

While sniper rifles can be satisfying and good for a *Call of Duty* game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, their over-saturation on PC makes the game less enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The issue is not with the guns themselves, which can be fun to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, but with the lack of diversity in gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Console Weapon Balance
In contrast, the [[weapon_balance_problems_on_pc_vs_console | weapon balance]] on consoles is generally considered "on point" and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Most console players believe sniper rifles are balanced and do not pose a significant problem on their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## The Discrepancy in Optimization
The core reason for this imbalance on PC is that the problematic weapons were optimized for [[comparison_of_black_ops_3_on_different_platforms | console player usage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The developers, Treyarch, inadvertently promote certain weapons by giving them better stats, which becomes an issue when these console-optimized stats are applied to PC gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Proposed Solution: Dedicated PC Balancing
To address this, there is a strong call for Treyarch to implement [[need_for_dedicated_pc_weapon_balancing_in_black_ops_3 | dedicated weapon balancing]] specifically for the PC community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This would involve creating weapon stats optimized solely for PC gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This concept is considered simple and should not be difficult for developers to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

This article details specific [[game_mechanics_and_controls | gameplay mechanics]] observed, focusing on early-game "hooks" and the "flash" ability.

## Level One Hooks

"Level one hooks" refer to the use of "hook" abilities very early in the game, specifically at level one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This suggests an aggressive, immediate strategy to engage opponents right from the start of a match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

> "Level one hooks. You ready? Does anybody else remember? Uh, get him. Get him. So much skill." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>

## Flash Mechanics

"Flash" is an [[game_mechanics_and_controls | ability]] or [[ingame_action_sequences | ingame action sequence]] that allows for rapid repositioning. Its effective use can be crucial for plays or escapes, described as a "nice flash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> when executed well.

### Flash Hook Maneuver

A "flash hook" is a combined [[gameplay_mechanics_and_item_usage | maneuver]] where a player uses the "flash" ability to get into position before immediately attempting a "hook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This can be a high-risk, high-reward play:

*   A player contemplated executing a "flash hook" but hesitated due to the perceived risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Another player encouraged the attempt, stating it was "a good idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   An attempt was made where the "flash" was successful, but the subsequent "hook" failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

The "flash" ability can also be used defensively, as suggested when an enemy player successfully "yuked" or dodged an incoming ability, described as "she's going to dodge it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

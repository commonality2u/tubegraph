This article details a specific anti-meta, troll, burn, and lockdown deck profile that can be built for under $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The deck, a Trap-Tricks Gravekeepers build, is described as very competitive and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Its primary goal is to shut down opponents' strategies through various control and disruption methods, while also inflicting burn damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Deck Strategy

The core strategy revolves around preventing opponents from [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoning]] monsters and controlling the field through powerful [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap cards]] and continuous effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It leverages the synergy between Trap-Tricks monsters and "Hole" [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap cards]], alongside the disruption capabilities of Gravekeeper's and other anti-meta staples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Monster Lineup

The monster selection focuses on control, searching for [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap cards]], and shutting down opponent plays:

*   **[[Yu Gi Oh Traptrix deck strategy | Trap-Tricks Myrmeleo]]** (2x): Essential for the deck. When normal summoned, it allows you to add any "Hole" [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap card]] from your deck to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. When [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoned]], it can destroy one spell or [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap card]] your opponent controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **[[Yu Gi Oh Traptrix deck strategy | Trap-Tricks Dionaea]]** (1x): [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | Special summons]] Trap-Tricks cards from the graveyard. When normal summoned, it can [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summon]] a Trap-Tricks monster from the graveyard, and when [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoned]], it can add a "Hole" [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap card]] from your graveyard to your hand, allowing for reuse of cards like Bottomless Trap Hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **[[Yu Gi Oh Traptrix deck strategy | Trap-Tricks Nepenthes]]** (2x): Features high defense and a useful effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **[[Yu Gi Oh Traptrix deck strategy | Trap-Tricks Atrax]]** (1x): Possesses high attack and a good effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo** (1x): A crucial card that prevents either player from [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoning]] monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. When flipped face-up, it destroys all [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoned]] monsters on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Gravekeeper's Spy** (2x): Considered the best Level 4 Gravekeeper for this deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. When flipped face-up, it can [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summon]] a Gravekeeper's monster with 1500 or less attack from your deck, allowing for immediate Xyz summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Summoner Monk** (1x): Useful for bringing out Level 4 monsters for Xyz plays, such as Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Kagetokage** (1x): Can be [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoned]] from the hand when a Level 4 monster is normal summoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Malefic Stardust Dragon** (1x): Included for extra attack power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. It can be [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoned]] by removing a Stardust Dragon from your Extra Deck from play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, making it easily accessible with field cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Santa Claws** (1x): A good card for removing powerful opponent's monsters like Quasar or Cyber Dragon Infinity, as its tribute summon cannot be negated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Spell Card Lineup

The spell cards aim to disrupt opponent's strategies, boost your monsters, and provide draw power:

*   **Black Garden** (1x): An "insane" and "trolly" field card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. When a monster is summoned (except flip summons), its attack is halved, and the opponent [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summons]] an 800 ATK/800 DEF Level 2 token, potentially building a token army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Necrovalley** (2x): Essential for the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. It boosts the attack and defense of Gravekeeper's monsters and prevents opponents from [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoning]] monsters from the graveyard, effectively shutting down decks like Shaddoll and Qliphort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Terraforming** (2x): Provides draw power to ensure you get your crucial field cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Dark Hole** (1x): A destruction card useful for clearing the field, especially as some monsters have effects when sent to the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Raigeki can be used as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Swords of Revealing Light** (2x): Used for stalling time, fitting the lockdown and troll nature of the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. It is preferred over Gravity Bind because it affects Xyz monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Burden of the Mighty** (1x): A "trolling" card that causes each face-up monster your opponent controls to lose 100 ATK for each of its own levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon (MST)** (1x): Essential for removing continuous spell/[[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Night Beam can be used as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Trap Card Lineup

The [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap cards]] are the backbone of this deck, providing significant disruption and burn potential:

*   **Bottomless Trap Hole** (1x): Limited to one, this card quickly removes strong [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoned]] monsters from play and is easily searchable by [[Yu Gi Oh Traptrix deck strategy | Trap-Tricks]] monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Trap Hole** (2x): While often overlooked, this card is effective in this deck when Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo prevents [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoning]], forcing opponents to normal summon into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **[[Yu Gi Oh Traptrix deck strategy | Trap-Tricks Trap Hole Nightmare]]** (1x): A strong [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap card]] that negates and destroys the effects of monsters that were [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoned]] this turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Deep Dark Trap Hole** (1x): Acts as a backup for Bottomless Trap Hole, banishing Level 5 or higher effect monsters that are [[YuGiOh Card Collecting Strategies | special summoned]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Solemn Warning** (1x): An essential "trolly" card that negates the summoning of any monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Nightmare Wheel** (2x): Preferred over Fiendish Chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. It prevents an opponent's monster from attacking and inflicts 500 damage to the opponent during each of your standby phases, contributing to the "burn" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Coffin Seller** (1x): Provides additional "burn" power, inflicting 300 damage to your opponent each time a monster card is sent to their graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Mirror Force** (1x): An essential [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap card]] for obvious defensive reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Scrap-Iron Scarecrow** (1x): A "trolly" card that can be reset face-down after use instead of going to the graveyard, providing continuous defensive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Magic Cylinder** (1x): Offers defensive power and significant burn damage by reflecting an opponent's attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Wall of Disruption** (1x): When an opponent's monster declares an attack, all attack position monsters they control lose 800 ATK for each monster they control, leading to massive ATK reduction (e.g., 2400 ATK loss for 3 monsters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. It's a strong alternative to Mirror Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device** (1x): An essential [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap card]] for returning opponent's monsters to their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Ceasefire** (2x): Provides powerful burn damage. If activated with multiple monsters on the field (yours and opponent's), it can inflict significant life point damage (e.g., 6000 LP with 6 monsters and two Ceasefires) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### Extra Deck Considerations

The Extra Deck for this build is flexible, primarily consisting of Rank 4 Xyz monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

*   **Leviair the Sea Dragon** (1x): Referred to as "Laval Chain" in the transcript, this card is essential for placing Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo on top of your deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Number 101: Silent Honor ARK** (1x): Described as having a "really broken effect" and being a great defensive Rank 4 Xyz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Number 50: Blackship of Corn** (1x): Deals 1000 damage if your opponent has a monster with less attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Number 55: Go-Go-Go Goliath** (1x): A temporary Rank 4 Xyz with a good effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

It's noted that you won't actually summon Stardust Dragon as there are no tuners in the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon**: Planned addition once a reprint makes it more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

The Extra Deck is generally flexible, with an emphasis on powerful Rank 4 Xyz monsters, especially [[comparison_of_different_yugioh_products | Leviair the Sea Dragon]] and Number 101: Silent Honor ARK, which are considered essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

This deck aims to confuse opponents and maintain competitive play at a very low cost, demonstrating that effective decks can be built on an extreme [[budget_decks_in_yugioh | budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Gameplay footage is available to demonstrate its competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

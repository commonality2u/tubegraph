The role of an AD Carry (ADC) in [[League of Legends]] is generally to deal consistent damage from a ranged position, often being a primary target for the enemy team due to their high damage output.

## Gameplay Interactions

Certain champions have abilities designed to target or interact with ADCs. For instance, a particular champion, referred to as "a layaway" in the transcript, is described as being able to "W jump onto the ad carry, press R" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This strategy involves using the W ability to engage an enemy ADC and then immediately using the R ability, followed by waiting for the W ability to become available again, which can be as quick as a three-second cooldown with 45% cooldown reduction (CDR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This highlights a specific [[League of Legends gameplay|gameplay]] scenario where an ADC is the target of a quick burst or engagement by an opposing champion.

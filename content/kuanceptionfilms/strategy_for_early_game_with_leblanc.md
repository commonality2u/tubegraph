Playing LeBlanc effectively in the early game involves specific itemization, jungle interaction, and aggressive lane plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Initial Itemization

Upon starting the game, it is suggested to purchase Hextech Revolver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This item choice is meant to provide significant early game power in lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Jungle and Lane Phase

*   **Jungle Presence:** Early in the game, position yourself near the opposing team's buff camp to assert presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This can make LeBlanc feel "OP" even without abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Vision Control:** You can trick opponents into placing wards at their Krugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Hiding:** Utilize the top bush to set up plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Early Skirmishes and Power Spikes

*   **Level One:** LeBlanc can easily half an enemy's health at level one with her abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Facing [[strategic_tips_for_playing_ekko_effectively | Ekko]]:** Be aware of [[strategic_tips_for_playing_ekko_effectively | Ekko]]'s Q ability, though it's noted to do little damage at level one against LeBlanc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. LeBlanc is considered strong at level one trades against many champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Level Three All-in:** Upon reaching level three, LeBlanc can engage and kill her enemy laner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Farming and Jungle Resources

*   **Minion Management:** Intentionally missing minions is suggested as a way to motivate farming kills later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Blue Buff:** Take your jungler's blue buff quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Jungler Ganks:** If an enemy jungler attempts a gank, ignore them to prevent them from taking your kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Death and Itemization

*   **Death Justification:** If you die in lane, attribute it to a minion rather than the enemy champion, as you are "never the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **First Back Items:** On your first return to base, prioritize purchasing the Spooky Mask and Star Root Wand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. These items are claimed to grant true damage that scales with your current gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

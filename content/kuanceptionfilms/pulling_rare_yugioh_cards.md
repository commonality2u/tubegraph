*   The Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon card itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Three 2015 Mega Tin Mega Packs, which reprint cards from sets released that year, including Stellarknight and Qliphort cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The artwork on the new Mega Tin is described as "fantastic" and "marvelous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

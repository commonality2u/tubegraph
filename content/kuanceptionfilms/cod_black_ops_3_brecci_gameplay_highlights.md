## Brecci Shotgun Overview
The Brecci is described as a semi-automatic shotgun, considered by the presenter to be arguably the best shotgun in the game, and potentially even the best gun overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Its power level is highlighted by the belief that "any noob" can pick up the gun and perform well, even achieve "dank streaks," suggesting it might be overpowered and "very OP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The presenter suggests the Brecci may require a nerf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

On PC, the Brecci's effectiveness is further enhanced by the ability to achieve 120 frames per second (fps), which benefits "rushing" playstyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

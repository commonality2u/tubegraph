Playing *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* on PC can present several challenges, particularly concerning performance, player competition, and the overall state of the game's PC version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## PC Optimization and Performance

Upon release, the PC version of *Black Ops 3* faced [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc|optimization challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While the PlayStation 4 version was noted to be running very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, the PC version experienced issues such as significant frame drops during gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. There was hope that these performance issues would be addressed in the weeks following the game's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Player Base and Competition

The PC platform for *Black Ops 3* is described as having a highly competitive demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Players new to PC or transitioning from consoles may find it difficult to adapt due to a noticeable learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

A significant [[issues_with_player_base_on_pc_black_ops_3|challenge related to the player base]] is the difficulty in finding matches. It can take several minutes (e.g., five minutes) to find a lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Gameplay Difficulties

Beyond technical performance, individual gameplay can be challenging. Some weapons, like certain shotguns, may be difficult to use effectively, sometimes requiring multiple shots to secure a kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Despite these difficulties, the game is generally considered to be fun, especially in modes like Gun Game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

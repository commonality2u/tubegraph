This article details the tactics employed by a [[YuGiOh Traptrix December 2015 deck profile | Traptrix Gravekeepers]] deck designed to be anti-meta, troll, burn, and lockdown focused, built for under $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Deck Philosophy and Overview

The core of this deck is its multi-faceted approach to frustrating and defeating opponents. It operates as a:
*   **Troll Deck:** Utilizing cards with annoying or disruptive effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Anti-Meta Deck:** Specifically designed to counter popular [[Competitive Gameplay Tips for YuGiOh | competitive strategies]], such as extensive special summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Burn Deck:** Inflicting direct damage to the opponent's Life Points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Lockdown Deck:** Preventing the opponent from making key plays, particularly special summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Extra Deck Contributions to Tactics

The Extra Deck primarily supports the [[Rank 4 XYZ Spam strategy | Rank 4 XYZ Spam strategy]] to generate consistent field presence and utility. It is flexible, but certain cards are essential for tactical plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

*   **Lavalval Chain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>
    *   Essential for placing Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo on top of the deck for subsequent draw and immediate use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Also useful for milling.
*   **Number 101: Silent Honor ARK** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>
    *   Possesses a "broken effect" for removal and is considered a great defensive [[Rank 4 XYZ Spam strategy | Rank 4 XYZ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Number 50: Blackship of Corn** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>
    *   Deals 1000 damage by targeting and sending an opponent's monster to the graveyard if its ATK is less than or equal to its own, contributing to the burn strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

*   **Number 39: Utopia** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>
    *   A staple Level 4 Xyz monster for any deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Stardust Dragon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>
    *   Included solely to enable the summoning of Malefic Stardust Dragon from the Main Deck, even without tuners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This provides high ATK power without taking up a valuable Main Deck slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
    *   Planned addition once reprinted, indicating a desire for more offensive Xyz options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Overall Strategy and Competitive Viability

The deck's strength lies in its ability to quickly establish lockdown states, such as preventing special summons with Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo in conjunction with Trap Hole for normal summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The [[Yugioh deck building strategies | deck building strategy]] focuses on using Traptrix monsters to access "Hole" traps, while Gravekeepers provide field presence and further support the anti-graveyard strategy with Necrovalley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

The "troll" aspect comes from using cards like Black Garden and Burden of the Mighty to constantly disrupt and annoy the opponent, while burn cards like Nightmare Wheel, Coffin Seller, Magic Cylinder, and Ceasefire whittle down their Life Points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Despite its unique and seemingly disparate card choices, the deck is noted for its competitive viability and effectiveness, especially given its budget-friendly cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

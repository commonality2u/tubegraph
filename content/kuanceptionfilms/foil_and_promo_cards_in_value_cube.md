[[yugioh_value_cube_openings | Yugioh Value Cubes]] from Target typically claim to contain 25 cards, two booster packs, and five foil cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, this information can be misleading, as the box might contain a 40-card deck, rendering the stated contents inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Value Cube Contents and Packaging

A typical [[yugioh_value_cube_contents | Yugioh value cube]] includes a structure deck, a "styrofoam pack" (often a booster pack like Hidden Arsenal 4), another booster pack (e.g., Return of the Duelist), and a "promo pack" containing foil cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Unboxing and Noteworthy Pulls

### Foil Pack
The foil pack, identified as a [[promotional_yugioh_cards | promotional Yugioh cards]] pack, typically contains various rare foil cards.
Notable pulls from a foil pack include:
*   Huge Ginja Susano'o (Platinum Rare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   Ginja Crane (Super Rare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   Arceus Commander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>

### Return of the Duelist Booster Pack
This booster pack can contain cards such as:
*   Shu Bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   Dust Knight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   Xyz Soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
Dust Knight is noted for its "dank" artwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Hidden Arsenal 4 Booster Pack
This pack may contain:
*   Genex Ally Power Cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
*   Sacred Spirit of the Ice Barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> â€” Ice Barrier cards are appreciated for their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Promo Foil Card
A separate promo foil card, "Ready for Intercepting," was pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This card allows targeting a warrior or spellcaster-type monster on the field to change it to face-down defense position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It is considered less effective compared to cards like Book of Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Gravekeeper's Structure Deck
The Gravekeeper's structure deck is considered a valuable component of the [[yugioh_value_cube_contents | Yugioh value cube]], being "pretty pricey on the secondary market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
Key cards from this deck include:

The overall value of the Gravekeeper's deck, especially when purchased for $9.99, makes the [[yugioh_value_cube_contents_and_value | value cube]] a worthwhile purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

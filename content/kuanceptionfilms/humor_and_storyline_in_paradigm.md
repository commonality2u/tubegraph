The game features both English and Russian language options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

## Storyline Elements
The game's narrative begins with an unusual infomercial for "Giro Del Genetics," a company offering to create the "misable child of your dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:91">[01:24:91]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. This process involves combining "broken dreams" with "cutting-edge genetic sequencing technology" and a "secret sauce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:19">[01:35:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>. The infomercial suggests that children can be made into specific professions, such as scientists or wizards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:76">[01:55:76]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:83">[02:00:83]</a>.

The protagonist needs to fix a computer character named John, whose operating system is "bugging" and requires a "boot disk" to be "reinstalled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:15">[05:04:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. The player's journey involves finding a map from a "babushka mailbox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:11">[10:46:11]</a> and delivering it to a character located in the "bottom right good forest" who is not expected to be wearing pants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:47">[12:09:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:37">[12:15:37]</a>. This concludes the alpha demo of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:47">[12:26:47]</a>.

## Humor in [[Paradigm game overview | Paradigm]]
[[Humor in video games | Humor]] is a central element of [[Paradigm game overview | Paradigm]], often stemming from its bizarre scenarios and character interactions.

### Infomercial Absurdity
The game opens with an infomercial that immediately sets a strange tone, asking questions like whether a child is a "child of failure" for having an art degree or expensive coffee tastes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. The notion of creating a "misable child of your dreams" and making an "allergic child" into a scientist or wizard adds to the absurdity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:95">[01:57:95]</a>. The commentator compares the "secret sauce" to McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:36">[01:48:36]</a>.

### Quirky Characters and Dialogue
The game's characters contribute significantly to its humor. A character named "Hal 9000" is mentioned, referencing the iconic AI from *2001: A Space Odyssey* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:21">[04:25:21]</a>. One character complains about the operating system "bugging" and threatens to "nail down to everyone we did always usually mind your life in carson egg within a 30 kilometer radius" if the computer isn't fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:15">[05:04:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21">[06:01:21]</a>. A robot is seen studying, which the commentator finds amusingly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:03">[08:16:03]</a>. Another character is described as having a "fetish for boxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:65">[09:55:65]</a>.

### Visual and Situational Gags
[[Gameplay mechanics of Paradigm | Gameplay]] situations also provide humor. The opening shows a "weird-lookin looking hand thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. A "DJ Jesus" shrine is discovered, featuring a record collection bought from a talking dog for ten euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:85">[06:27:85]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:03">[06:36:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. The game features a "babushka mailbox" and a "convenient plot development" as the character leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:11">[10:46:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:10">[07:45:10]</a>.

The developer's humor is evident in their [[Kickstarter campaign for Paradigm | Kickstarter]] plea at the end of the demo: "if you do check out my [[Kickstarter campaign for Paradigm | Kickstarter]] so i can buy myself a nose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:64">[12:34:64]</a>. The game also includes meta-humor, such as references to "Nigerian Princes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:85">[13:02:85]</a>.

Understanding the [[collectibility_and_value_of_yugioh_cards | market value]] of YuGiOh cards involves assessing product claims, the desirability of individual cards, and their utility in gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Product Expectations vs. Reality

When opening products like [[yugioh_value_cube_opening | YuGiOh value cubes]] from Target, the packaging can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For instance, a [[yugioh_value_cube_opening | value cube]] might state it contains 25 cards, 2 boosters, and 5 foil cards, but actually contain a 40-card deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It is advisable to disregard the information on the side of such packaging, as it may not be accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The goal is to find "dank stuff" (desirable cards) within these packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Valuable Cards and Decks

Certain cards and archetypes hold significant [[value_and_rarity_of_yugioh_cards | value]] within the YuGiOh secondary market:

*   **Gravekeeper's Deck:** The Gravekeeper's structure deck is considered "pretty pricey on the secondary market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Obtaining this deck for $9.99 through a [[yugioh_value_cube_opening | value cube]] is considered a worthwhile purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   Notable cards within the Gravekeeper's structure deck include:
        *   Mystical Beast of Serket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
        *   Temple of the Kings (which "used to be banned") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
        *   Lava Golem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>
        *   Mystic Tomato (still "pretty good to this date") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
        *   Gravekeeper's Spy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
        *   Gravekeeper's Assailant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
        *   Gravekeeper's Descendant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
        *   Creature Swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>
        *   Book of Moon (described as "amazing") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>
        *   Foolish Burial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
        *   Mirror Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
        *   Necrovalley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
*   **High Rarity Cards:** Pulling an Ultimate Rare, such as Champion Excalibur, is considered a highly desirable ("dankest") pull from a pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Aesthetic Appeal:** Cards with "dank" or appealing artwork, like Dust Knight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> or Ice Barrier cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, can also contribute to their desirability.
*   **Utility in Gameplay:** Cards like Lava Golem are "always nice to run in burn decks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, indicating their practical value for players. However, some cards, like "Ready for Intercepting," are considered "trash" if a superior alternative (e.g., Book of Moon) exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Despite receiving "countless mega packs over the years," suggesting that some pulls might not be groundbreaking for an experienced opener, the overall [[yugioh_value_cube_opening | value cube opening]] was considered worthwhile, particularly due to the Gravekeeper's deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

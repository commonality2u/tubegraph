This glitch in Minecraft Pocket Edition (iOS) allows players to instantly teleport to the top of a tower using a door, serving various purposes including [[creating_an_elevator_with_glitches | creating an elevator]] or escaping dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## How to Perform the Glitch

To perform this glitch, you will need a wooden door (or trap door) and building materials such as cobblestone or wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

1.  **Construct the Tower** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>: Build a tower that is exactly straight with a pole straight down the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
2.  **Place the Door** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>: Place a wooden door or trap door directly underneath the tower you've constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
3.  **Enter and Close the Door** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>: Walk up to the door and close it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. You should become stuck inside the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
4.  **Exit and Re-enter the Game** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>: While stuck, close out of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Then, re-open Minecraft Pocket Edition and return to your game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

Upon re-entering, you should be teleported to the very top of the tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications

This glitch offers several strategic advantages:
*   **Elevator** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>: It can effectively be used to [[creating_an_elevator_with_glitches | create an elevator]] to quickly ascend structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Survival Fortification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>: If [[using_glitches_as_a_survival_strategy_in_minecraft_pe | attacked by zombies]] or other hostile mobs and you don't have a bed, you can quickly build a door, use the glitch to teleport to safety at the top of a tower, creating a temporary fortress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

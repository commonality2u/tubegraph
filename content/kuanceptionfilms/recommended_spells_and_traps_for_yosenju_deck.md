The Yosenju deck, particularly a [[yosenju_budget_deck_profile | budget build]], is noted as an anti-meta, tier-two deck capable of inflicting heavy damage to most tier-one decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. A key [[key_yosenju_card_strategies | strategy]] for this deck involves spamming normal summons and generally avoiding special summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This unique playstyle dictates the choice of its spell and trap cards, many of which exploit the deck's non-special summoning nature.

## Spell Cards

Spell cards in the Yosenju deck primarily focus on draw power, searching, and disruption, leveraging the fact that Yosenju monsters return to the hand at the end of the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

*   **Fire Formation - Tenki**
    *   This continuous spell card is a valuable source of draw power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   It allows players to search their deck for a Yosenju monster to add to their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   Additionally, all Beast-Warrior monsters gain 100 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Dimensional Fissure**
    *   This "floodgate" card causes any monster sent to the graveyard to be banished instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   It's highly effective in a Yosenju deck because Yosenju monsters typically return to the hand, meaning few Yosenju monsters are sent to the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
    *   The Yosenju deck does not rely on special summoning or retrieving cards from the graveyard, making this card's effect negligible for the player, but disruptive for opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   It's particularly strong against decks like Shaddolls or Heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Book of Moon**
    *   Considered an "essential card" for almost any deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon (MST)**
    *   Another "essential card" for spell/trap removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Pot of Duality**
    *   This card is "abused" in the Yosenju deck due to its non-special summoning strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   It allows players to look at the top three cards of their deck, choose one to add to their hand, but prevents special summoning for the rest of the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This restriction is inconsequential for Yosenju <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Upstart Goblin**
    *   Provides great draw power, which is essential for a deck that uses relatively few monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Dark Hole**
    *   Included over Raigeki because Yosenju monsters return to the hand at the end of the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This means the player often has no monsters on their side of the field during the opponent's turn, making Dark Hole a one-sided board wipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Trap Cards

Trap cards in a Yosenju deck are crucial for defense and interruption, especially given that monsters return to the hand.

*   **Yosenju Secret Move**
    *   This card allows the player to negate the activation of a spell, trap, or monster effect and destroy that card, provided they control at least one Yosenju monster and all face-up monsters they control are Yosenju monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   It has an "overpowered" synergy with Yosenju Shinchu L: if Shinchu L is the only Yosenju card on the field (as a pendulum card), and no other monsters are controlled, the "all monsters you control are Yosenju" condition is met, allowing the negation effect to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Vanity's Emptiness**
    *   Another "floodgate" card that works well because the Yosenju deck does not rely on special summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Bottomless Trap Hole**
    *   Considered an "essential" trap card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device**
    *   Also an "essential" trap card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Mirror Force**
    *   Included as a strong defensive measure because the Yosenju player often has no monsters on their side of the field during the opponent's turn, allowing for a clear board wipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

The strategic choice of these spells and traps, particularly those that capitalize on the lack of special summoning and the return of Yosenju monsters to the hand, helps the [[yosenju_budget_deck_profile | Yosenju budget deck profile]] maintain its competitive edge against various meta decks.

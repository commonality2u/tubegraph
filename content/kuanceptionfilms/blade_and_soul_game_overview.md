*Blade and Soul* is a brand new MMORPG that was released a little over a week prior to this commentary, already attracting millions of registered players, making it a very popular new title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Initial Impressions and Challenges
The game is described as "so hot right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:37]</a>. However, one significant challenge noted is the incredibly long queue times, humorously estimated to be "a little bit over five billion hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:53]</a>.

## [[character_creation_and_customization_in_blade_and_soul | Character Creation and Customization]]
Players can create new characters and choose from various classes, including Assassin, Blade Master, and Kung Fu Master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:17]</a>. The Blade Master is considered the least difficult class to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:34]</a>.

Customization options are extensive:
*   **Races**: An option for a "Wally" race is mentioned, though the presenter chooses a "mainstream Jen female Blade Master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Facial Types and Hair**: Players can change facial types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:21]</a> and cycle through various hairdos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:43]</a>, including changing hair color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:30]</a>. Some colors are noted to be "blinding" in brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Body Types**: There are "really minimal differences" in body types initially, though one change literally reduced the character's height by two feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Cosmetic Details**: Options include facial decorations and adjusting lip gloss to 100 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **"Jiggle Physics"**: A prominent feature discussed is the "jiggle physics," exaggerated as "an ocean but then give it like jiggle physics times seven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:38]</a>. It's noted that a "dank computer" enhances this effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:49]</a>. The jiggle physics are observed to go "crazy" when changing hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Stat Boosts**: There's a humorous claim that making a character black provides a 30% stats boost to strength, agility, and "everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:03:11]</a>.

After customization, players must choose a server to play on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:15]</a>.

## [[initial_impressions_and_experiences_with_blade_and_soul_mmo | Gameplay Commentary and First Impressions]]
The game begins with an initial cutscene showing a raining scene inside the ocean, portraying how "a whole MMO started out" by trying to establish the player as a legendary figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:33]</a>.

### [[gameplay_mechanics_and_graphics_of_blade_and_soul | Gameplay Mechanics and Graphics]]
*   **Graphics**: The game was played on an 800x600 window at the lowest graphic settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:42]</a>. Despite low settings, the water graphics were impressive, noted as "damn son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:47]</a>. Lighting effects were also described as "Opie" (overpowered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Movement**: The sprint ability is "Opie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:08]</a>, and the character learns a glide ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:38]</a>. The camera can be changed by scrolling, which is intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Combat**: The game features intense combos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:11]</a>. Combat is described as "very exciting" but also "complete trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:12]</a>. The player equips skills and equipment from an NPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **XP System**: The XP bar did not move after killing a training dummy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:26]</a>, but leveling up provides an "XP boost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **PvP**: The quality of PvP in the game is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Death**: The player died within five minutes of playing, humorously stating, "I'm obviously MLG MLG optic man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:54]</a>. The game features a revive mechanism by pressing a key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Map**: The map is described as intuitive, making it easy to find objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Anime Adaptation
The *Blade and Soul* anime is mentioned and summarily dismissed as having "sucked ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Future Plans
The content creator, Victor of Quan Ception Films, plans to make more *Blade and Soul* videos in the future with "rice expert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:15]</a>. This video concludes the initial tutorial section of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:20:02]</a>.

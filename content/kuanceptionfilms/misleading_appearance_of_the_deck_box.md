The Yugioh deck box featured in the unboxing video initially presents a deceptive appearance, leading the viewer to believe it is something other than a card container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Initial Impressions

When first introduced, the box, referred to as "the crate," resembles an egg carton, specifically one designed to hold 18 eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, this is described as a "trick," as the container is actually a Yugioh deck box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The box also displays a few stains, which are said to contribute to its "character" and indicate its rarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It is claimed to be 200 years old, further suggesting its antique and rare nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Contents' Appearance

Upon [[opening_a_rare_yugioh_deck_box | opening the deck box]], the contents initially appear to be nothing more than painted rocks, reminiscent of childhood creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This misleading visual is quickly dispelled, as the box is revealed to hold "a lot more than that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The actual contents include League of Legends codes and ultra-rare Yu-Gi-Oh! cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

It is suggested that the box was left to ferment for about two weeks, which supposedly caused the League of Legends codes to "pop up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Later, after another supposed fermentation period, the box yields a "panda bundle" with panda figurines, which the presenter collects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

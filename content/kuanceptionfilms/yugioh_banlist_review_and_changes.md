The Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game (TCG) implemented a new Forbidden & Unlimited List, effective July 16, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This list was anticipated by players, with information circulating from sources like Zodiac Duelist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

## Key Changes and Player Reactions

### Djinn Releaser of Rituals (Banned)
"Djinn Releaser of Rituals" was moved to the forbidden list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This change was criticized as the card had been a staple for "years and years and years" in helping [[Unbanned cards and their potential in YuGiOh gameplay | ritual decks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The speaker felt that Konami should have targeted "Nekroz" cards directly instead of impacting "Djinn Releaser of Rituals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

### Stellarknight Constellar Diamond (Banned)
"Stellarknight Constellar Diamond" was banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This decision was surprising to the speaker, who thought "Tellarknights" were hit with this ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. It was speculated that the ban was preemptive, anticipating "sick-ass combos" with the release of "Oden" (likely referring to "Zoodiac Drident" or similar future card) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### Nekroz (Nerfed)
The "Nekroz" archetype received nerfs on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, with "Seine Nekroz" explicitly mentioned as being hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Despite the hits, the speaker expressed frustration that certain "Nekroz" cards weren't fully banned or limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## Unchanged Cards and Archetypes

Several prominent archetypes and cards remained untouched:
*   **Shaddolls:** The speaker lamented that "Shaddolls" were not "freed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Burning Abyss:** This archetype was "didn't really touch at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Qliphorts:** Similar to Burning Abyss, "Qliphorts weren't touched" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Lose One Turn:** The speaker specifically hoped for "Lose One Turn" to be limited, criticizing its impact on competitive play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

Overall, the banlist was described as disappointing, particularly due to the lack of changes for certain powerful cards and archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

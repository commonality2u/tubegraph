The commentary focuses on the player character's actions and interactions within the game world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Commentary Style and Elements

Commentary in this instance is characterized by:

*   **Direct Interaction with Gameplay**: The commentator frequently describes on-screen actions, such as "wreck[ing] a bunch of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, dragging a car with an "Invincible tongue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, or attempting maneuvers like a "360" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Catchphrases and Repetition**: A recurring phrase, "Get Wrecked," is used throughout the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Exclamations and Reactions**: The commentator uses exclamations like "oh my God" to express surprise or excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> and demonstrates strong positive [[reaction_to_video_games | reactions]] to the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **[[Parody_elements_in_gaming_videos | Parody]] and Hyperbole**: The commentary often employs hyperbolic statements, such as claiming the game "defines the future" or "the future of America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, and that it defines them "as a person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

*   **Role-playing and Dialogue**: The commentator engages in improvised dialogue, for example, asking an NPC for Doritos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> or declaring "yes I am a soccer mom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Self-awareness and Meta-commentary**: The commentator occasionally acknowledges the absurdity of the game's physics, stating that "one lick with a goat can destroy a whole car, that makes perfect sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Concluding Remarks**: The video ends with the commentator expressing hope that viewers enjoyed the "funny moments" and indicating that more episodes of "Goat Simulator" commentary could be released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

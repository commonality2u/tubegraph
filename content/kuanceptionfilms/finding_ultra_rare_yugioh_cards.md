An unboxing video by Seth from Conception Films details the process of opening a supposedly rare YuGiOh deck box in search of ultra rare cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The box, described as a "rare box" and the last one found on a Walmart shelf, contains a full "Warlock Burst Set deck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Initially, the box resembles an 18-egg carton but is actually a YuGiOh deck box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It is noted to have stains, adding "character," and is humorously claimed to be 200 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Unboxing the "Rare" Deck Box

After "fermenting" the box for approximately two weeks, the initial contents revealed were League of Legends RP codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Beneath these codes, the speaker expected to find [[Rare and Promo YuGiOh Cards | ultra rare Yu-Gi-Oh cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Initial Card Pulls
The cards "pulled" included:
*   An "ultra ultra rare" Charizard YuGiOh card, described as very rare and not available in stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Another Charizard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   A "Dark Dugtrio," which was dismissed as "a piece of crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   A yellow Raichu card, seemingly in Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Legendary Discoveries
The speaker then discovered a "double card" with two sides, which was considered "awesome Japanese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The pack also "promised" more "level X's and legendaries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, including another two-face card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Subsequent Fermentation and Outcomes

### Round Two
After allowing the box to ferment for "another two weeks," the next revelation was a YuGiOh starter booster pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This pack contained tempera paint in five colors: green, blue, red, white, and yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The speaker expressed disappointment, stating this was "not what I was looking for at all," as he desired more legendaries like those previously seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The intention was to sell the cards for maximum value, as the speaker does not play YuGiOh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### The Panda Bundle
After another "couple weeks" of fermentation, the box yielded "the panda bundle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This included three rare panda figurines, which the speaker collects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The bundle featured:
*   A "traditional bumblebee panda" with black stripes, ears, and raccoon-like eye circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   An "ultra rare" panda figurine, which excited the speaker to the point of tears and requiring a video remake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Despite being broken and "a little dense," it was deemed valuable enough to sell for "about like two cents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   A small but "mighty powerful" panda that "clears the entire Yu-Gi-Oh battle arena" of cards, figurines, wax figures, and bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This effect combines with a League of Legends RP card to "win the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Final Attempt and Disappointment
The speaker anticipated receiving the "most rare set" after the panda bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. However, the final fermentation attempt was deemed a failure, yielding nothing of worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The cards were described as "not legendary" and "worthless," unable to be played or stacked, and only serving to give the opponent twenty dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The speaker concluded by expressing frustration with the increasingly "crappier" draws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Ekko, known as "the boy who shattered time," is a daredevil genius who uses his inventions to survive and thrive on the corrupted streets of Zaun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. As a champion in [[League of Legends gameplay strategies | League of Legends]], Ekko possesses a unique kit that allows for high mobility, burst damage, and strategic repositioning.

## [[Abilities and Mechanics of Ekko | Core Abilities and Mechanics]]

*   **Resonance**: Triggering resonance on an enemy champion applies extra damage and a slow, and also provides Ekko with a brief "briefie" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **W - Parallel Convergence**:
    *   **Passive**: Ekko's basic attacks deal extra magic damage to all low-health enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Phase Dive**: Both parts of this ability allow Ekko to pass through terrain, providing significant mobility and unexpected engagement or escape routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This ability allows Ekko to be "pretty OP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **R - Chrono-Break**: When Ekko uses Chrono-Break, he briefly turns untargetable and invulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Upon reappearing, he heals based on the amount of punishment he has taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## General Strategy and Tools

Ekko utilizes a variety of crowd control tools, including stuns and snares, alongside his standard attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Engaging Isolated Targets

A key strategy for playing Ekko involves identifying a "quitter" or an enemy player positioned away from their team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The approach is to get in, secure the kill, and get out before the enemy team can react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## [[Common Mistakes in Playing Ekko | Common Mistakes / How NOT to Play Ekko]]

The video explicitly states that certain plays are examples of "how to not play Ekko," indicating actions that are generally incorrect or suboptimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

*   **Misusing Chrono-Break in Slowing Zone**: An example of a poor play is to use Chrono-Break to put yourself back into a slowing zone as the enemy team is heading through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. While the idea might be to utilize a stun (implied by "without vision they'll walk right into your stun"), this specific execution is warned against, as it will "probably get shrekt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Lack of Vision**: Engaging without proper vision can lead to easily being stunned, even if the enemy might walk into your stun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

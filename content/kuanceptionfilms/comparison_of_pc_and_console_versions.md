The Black Ops 3 beta experienced significant differences in performance and optimization between its PC and console versions, as observed by players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Gameplay Experience

Initial impressions of the Black Ops 3 beta included showcasing melee attacks, which were noted as "op" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## PC Performance Issues

Despite Call of Duty's historical roots as a PC-exclusive franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, the Black Ops 3 beta on PC showed considerable optimization problems.

Key issues reported include:
*   **Terrible performance**: The game ran poorly even on systems with a 750 Ti graphics card, which was considered "all right" and "not outdated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Lack of Optimization**: The game did not feel well-[[game_optimization_issues_on_different_platforms | optimized for PC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Frame Rate**: While recording with Fraps, the frame rate was consistent, but large drops were common during gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Game-breaking Lag**: Players experienced significant lag that severely impacted gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Launch and Connectivity Issues**: Some players reported not being able to launch the game or connect to servers at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Previous Call of Duty titles have had varying degrees of [[game_optimization_issues_on_different_platforms | PC optimization]]:
*   *Modern Warfare 3* and *Black Ops 2* were considered "all right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   *Black Ops 1* and *Ghosts* were described as "complete crap" regarding their PC optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The overall sentiment for the Black Ops 3 beta on PC was that it was "not looking ideal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, leading to the conclusion that [[pros_and_cons_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | PC players "have it hard"]] due to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Players without a "killer machine" were expected to experience lag and complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Console Performance

In stark contrast to the PC beta, the PlayStation 4 beta for Black Ops 3 was described as "amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Even a self-proclaimed console Call of Duty player, who was not primarily a PlayStation 4 player, had "great fun" and performed well on the console version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The game was generally deemed "really fun on the consoles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Shared Positive Aspect

Across both [[pc_versus_console_gameplay_performance | PC and console versions]], the game received praise for its "amazing audio quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Outlook

There was strong hope that the optimization issues on PC would be resolved before the game's full release, with calls for Treyarch to polish the game and ensure a better experience for PC gamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

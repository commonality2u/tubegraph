Cooldown Reduction (CDR) is a game mechanic that affects the availability of abilities during gameplay.

## Impact on Ability Cooldowns

CDR directly reduces the time an ability takes to become available again after use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[01:51]</a>. For instance, with 45% CDR, a specific "W-2 ability" can have its cooldown reduced to approximately three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[01:49]</a>. This allows players to use abilities more frequently, potentially impacting [[multiplayer_strategies_and_gameplay_techniques_in_black_ops_3 | gameplay]] flow and effectiveness.

[[Yugioh value cube openings | YuGiOh value cube openings]] involve opening a specific product known as a "value cube," which promises a variety of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards and packs.

## Stated vs. Actual Contents
Value cubes are advertised to contain 25 cards and two booster packs [00:00:21]. However, this claim can be misleading, as some cubes include a structure deck, which by itself contains more than 25 cards [00:00:28].

## Contents of a Typical Value Cube
A [[Yugioh value cube contents | YuGiOh value cube]] typically includes:
*   A promo card [00:00:59].
*   Multiple booster packs [00:01:27].
*   A structure deck [00:01:46].

## Example Opening: Inception Films Value Cube
An opening by Inception Films featured the following [[Yugioh value cube contents and value | contents and value]]:

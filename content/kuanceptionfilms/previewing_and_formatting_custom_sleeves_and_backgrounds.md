3.  Locate the image, select it, and click "open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
4.  If prompted to resize the image, confirm by pressing "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Image Sizing for Backgrounds

Similar to sleeves, when adding a custom background, the game will prompt you to resize the image to the correct dimensions for optimal display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Confirm by selecting "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Installation Process for Backgrounds

1.  From the "content" tab, select "backgrounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Adding In-Game Backgrounds

Separate from the general interface backgrounds, specific [[installing_custom_backgrounds_in_ygo_devpro | wallpapers]] can be applied to the actual duel environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Installation Process for In-Game Backgrounds

To confirm that both [[tutorial_on_adding_custom_sleeves_in_ygo_devpro | custom sleeves]] and [[installing_custom_backgrounds_in_ygo_devpro | wallpapers]] are correctly installed and formatted, enter an actual duel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

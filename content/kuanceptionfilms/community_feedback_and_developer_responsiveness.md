Victor of Conception Films initiated a discussion regarding issues with the PC version of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, particularly concerning weapon balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This commentary serves as direct [[community_and_communication_in_gaming | community feedback]] aimed at the game's developer, Treyarch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Specific Feedback: Weapon Imbalance on PC Black Ops 3

The primary concern raised is the prevalent overuse of specific weapons on the PC platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The Drakon and P-06 sniper rifles, along with the Brecci shotgun, are reportedly "overpopulating" and "oversaturating" the game due to extensive spamming by a large portion of the [[issues_with_player_base_on_pc_black_ops_3 | PC player base]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that while sniper rifles can be satisfying and good for Call of Duty, the lack of variety ruins the experience when "everybody" uses the same weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Players desire variety and fun in their games, not predictable encounters solely involving these dominant weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The issue stems from the weapons being optimized for console player usage, leading to problematic performance on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Call for Dedicated PC Weapon Optimization

The core proposal for developer responsiveness is the implementation of dedicated weapon balancing specifically for the PC platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Unlike consoles, where weapon balance is perceived to be "on point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, the PC environment requires its own "dedicated weapon stats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This is presented as a "very simple concept" that "shouldn't be very hard for developers to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Victor of Conception Films undertakes a [[yugioh_card_pulls_and_reactions | Yu-Gi-Oh! card pull]] by unboxing a Primal Origin Korean OCG booster box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The goal is to discover what treasures lie within the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, specifically hoping to pull cards like Bujin cards or Galaxy-Eyes Photon cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The booster box contains 40 booster packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Notable Pulls and Rarities

Throughout the unboxing, various rare and special cards are pulled:

The video concludes with a recap of the super rare cards, showing four overall, including a Bujin card, a "Photon Post" card, and two Exceeds cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## Reactions to Pulls
The unboxer expresses excitement and [[reactions_to_unexpected_and_rare_card_pulls | reactions to unexpected and rare card pulls]] at several points:
*   Excitement for the Trap Trick Dyna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Anticipation for a super rare or [[prismatic_rare_and_artifact_card_pulls | artifact card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   A declaration that they will get a hollow card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   Pleasure at pulling the first super rare, Chaos Number 103 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   Frustration when a pack contains no foils or rares, feeling "ripped off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

*   Joy at the Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon pull, calling it a "good pull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

Despite [[discussion_of_lucky_pulls_and_repeats | discussion of lucky pulls and repeats]], there are also instances of disappointment, like when a pack yields only common cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The unboxer attempts to influence pulls by "wrecking" or cutting open packs in specific ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, believing it affects the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

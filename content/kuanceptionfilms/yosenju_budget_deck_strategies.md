The [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] deck is presented as a strong [[budget_decks_in_yugioh | budget deck]] option, potentially buildable for under $40, or even under $30 if the extra deck is disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is considered one of the best [[budget_decks_in_yugioh | budget decks]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This deck is described as "anti-meta" and "tier two," capable of dealing heavy damage to most tier one decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Core Strategy

The primary goal of the Yosenju deck is to spam [[normal_summoning_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | Normal Summons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The deck intentionally avoids special summoning, which is a key aspect of its playstyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Yosenju monsters generally return themselves to the hand at the end of the turn, leaving the player's field empty on the opponent's turn, which supports defensive strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Key Monsters and Their Strategies

The deck primarily focuses on specific [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] monster cards for its main offensive and defensive maneuvers.

### Yosenju Kama 1
*   **Role**: Returns any face-up card your opponent controls back to their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Synergy**: Helps facilitate additional [[normal_summoning_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | Normal Summons]] of [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] cards, acting as a "double summon" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Yosenju Kama 2
*   **Role**: Allows you to attack your opponent directly for half damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Synergy**: Similar to Kama 1, it allows for an additional [[normal_summoning_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | Normal Summon]] of another [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Yosenju Kama 3
*   **Role**: When another [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] card on your field deals damage to your opponent, you can search a [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] card from your deck and add it to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Synergy**: Particularly effective when comboed with Kama 2, as Kama 2's direct attack triggers Kama 3's search effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This can lead to another [[normal_summoning_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | Normal Summon]] or searching for cards like Yosenju Tsujik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Yosenju Tsujik
*   **Role**: A versatile card with two effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   **First Effect**: Can be discarded during the damage step to give a [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] card 1000 ATK, similar to "Honest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   **Second Effect**: If [[normal_summoning_tactics_in_yosenju_deck | Normal Summoned]], you can target a [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] card on the field to have it gain 1000 ATK, similar to "Juragedo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Yosenju Shinchu L
*   **Role**: Acts as a defensive pendulum card. If a [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] monster you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can destroy Shinchu L instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Synergy**: Creates a powerful combination with [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | Yosenju Secret Move]]. When Secret Move activates, if Shinchu L is the only [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] monster on the field (as a pendulum card), it can still fulfill Secret Move's condition, making it an "overpowered" combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Card Card D
*   **Role**: Provides significant draw power to the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Given that the deck often relies on its [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | traps]] for defense and often has no monsters on the field during the opponent's turn, having Card Card D to draw more cards is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Key Spells and Their Strategies

### Fire Formation - Tenki
*   **Role**: Excellent draw power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Effect**: Allows you to search your deck for a [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] monster. As a continuous spell, it also grants all your Beast-Warrior monsters 100 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Dimensional Fissure
*   **Role**: A "floodgate" card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Effect**: Any monster sent to the graveyard is banished instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Highly effective in [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenjus]] because the deck rarely sends its own monsters to the graveyard or tries to retrieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. It's particularly strong against decks like Shadow Tellers and Heroes that rely on graveyard effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Pot of Duality
*   **Role**: Abused for its draw and search power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Effect**: Allows you to look at the top three cards of your deck, add one to your hand, but then you cannot special summon for the rest of the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Since the Yosenju deck rarely special summons, the restriction of Pot of Duality is negligible, making it an excellent card for consistency and searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Upstart Goblin
*   **Role**: Provides additional draw power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Essential for a deck with a low monster count like Yosenju, ensuring more consistent access to key cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Dark Hole
*   **Role**: Mass monster removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Unlike "Raigeki," Dark Hole's self-destruction effect is less impactful for Yosenju, as their monsters return to the hand at the end of the turn anyway, leaving the field clear for Dark Hole on your turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Key Traps and Their Strategies

[[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | Trap Cards]] are a crucial part of the Yosenju deck's defensive strategy.

### Yosenju Secret Move
*   **Role**: A powerful counter trap card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Effect**: If a spell/trap card or monster effect is activated while you control at least one [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] card and all face-up monsters you control are [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] monsters, you can negate the activation and destroy that card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Synergy**: As mentioned, it's particularly potent with Yosenju Shinchu L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Vanity's Emptiness
*   **Role**: Another "floodgate" [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Effect**: Prevents both players from special summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: This card is "abused" in [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] because the deck explicitly avoids special summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This severely cripples many meta decks that rely heavily on special summoning, while having almost no negative impact on the [[yosenju_deck_composition_and_cards | Yosenju]] player.

### Mirror Force
*   **Role**: Defensive combat [[Trap Card Strategies in YuGiOh | trap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Since the Yosenju deck often has no monsters on the field during the opponent's turn, Mirror Force serves as a reliable defensive measure against direct attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Extra Deck Considerations

While the extra deck can be disregarded for a stricter [[costeffective_card_options_for_yosenju_deck | budget build]], certain cards offer valuable strategic options.

*   **Lightning Chidori**: A powerful XYZ monster that can send cards back to the opponent's deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. It requires two Level 4 Wind monsters to summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King**: Can search for Fire Formation - Tenki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon**: Provides strong offensive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer & Silent Honor ARK**: Essential Rank 4 XYZ monsters for disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Gagaga Cowboy**: Considered one of the best Rank 4 options for the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. It can gain ATK in attack position or deal 800 direct damage in defense position, which can be crucial for closing out games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Lavalval Chain**: Useful for decks that interact with the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Budget and Viability

The Yosenju deck is highly viable as a [[budget_decks_in_yugioh | budget deck]], especially if the extra deck, which contains some of the more costly cards, is excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. It remains a fun and effective option for local tournaments and casual play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

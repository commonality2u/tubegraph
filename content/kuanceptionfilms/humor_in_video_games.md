Videos that showcase gameplay often highlight these [[funny_moments_in_gaming | funny moments]], contributing to [[humor_in_video_game_commentary | humor in video game commentary]].

## Goat Simulator as an Example of In-Game Humor
"Goat Simulator" is presented as a game where humor is inherent to its design and chaotic gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The game itself creates [[funny_moments_in_gaming | funny moments]] through its absurd scenarios and physics engine.

During gameplay, a player might experience and react to:
*   Unintended physical phenomena, such as a character floating in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   The humorous impact of the game's accompanying music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   The unpredictability of character movement, like nearly falling off structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Bizarre interactions, such as a goat licking a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   The unexpected successful execution of a chaotic action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Changes in game state, like the game suddenly slowing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Attempts at unconventional actions, such as trying to "eat flowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Encountering unusual in-game events, like a "man on fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Difficulty with basic game mechanics, such as repeatedly missing a ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Failed attempts at interaction, such as missing a truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Comical strategies, like trying to "sneak up" on an in-game character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Accidental actions leading to humorous outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   Humorous observations about game objects, such as "penis-shaped food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> or "grass in his butt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

The collective experience of these elements contributes to "Goat Simulator" being considered one of the [[hilarious_pc_games | hilarious PC games]].

## Player Reactions and Commentary
A key aspect of [[humor_in_video_game_commentary | humor in video game commentary]] is showcasing a player's genuine [[reaction_to_video_games | reaction to video games]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A [[video_game_commentary | video game commentary]] can be created by observing a player's live reactions, which inherently creates [[game_commentary_humor | game commentary humor]]. For instance, a player's exclamations and observations during gameplay, such as "Oh my god why okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> or "oh lord jesus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, contribute significantly to the comedic value of the content.

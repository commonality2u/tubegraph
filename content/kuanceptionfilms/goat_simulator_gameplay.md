## Initial Impressions and Reactions
Upon starting, the player immediately encounters peculiar aspects of the game's physics, exclaiming, "why am i floating what's going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The game's music is noted to enhance the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The player often expresses confusion or surprise, such as "oh my god why okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> and "why is it slow now what did i do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Interaction with Game Mechanics and Environment
The player engages with various elements of the *Goat Simulator* environment:
*   **Licking** – A primary mechanic, the player attempts to lick objects and characters, sometimes with difficulty, asking "why isn't he turning around i'm licking his freaking oh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Environmental Obstacles** – Challenges arise from navigating the terrain, with the player almost falling off ledges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> and repeatedly missing ladders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Certain areas are deemed "bad" due to these difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Non-Player Characters (NPCs)** – The player attempts to interact with NPCs, seeking to "be your friend" with a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Encounters include a man on fire, prompting a surprised "oh jesus oh i said oh lord jesus better leave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The player also expresses determination to "get him this time" when encountering an NPC again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Accidental Actions** – The unpredictable nature of the goat's movements leads to unintentional actions, such as "whoops oh oh i didn't mean to oh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Humorous Elements and Commentary
The [[video_game_commentary]] often highlights the absurd humor inherent in *Goat Simulator*. This [[Game commentary humor]] is evident in reactions to bizarre situations like a man being on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> or observing "grass in his butt" on an NPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The player's running commentary and spontaneous exclamations contribute significantly to the [[parody_elements in gaming videos]] that *Goat Simulator* embodies. The goal of causing chaos and performing various [[goat_simulator_stunts_and_tricks]] is a core part of its appeal.

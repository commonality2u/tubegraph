[[Gaming commentary | Gaming commentary]] and [[humor_in_video_games | humor in video games]] often involve a mix of player reactions, over-the-top descriptions, and banter with co-commentators or friends. This style can be observed in a gameplay video for *Blade & Soul*, an MMORPG that had attracted millions of registered players within a week of its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Elements of Humor and Commentary

### Interactive Banter
A key component of [[gaming humor and banter | gaming humor and banter]] is the interaction between the main commentator and a co-commentator, such as "Rice Expert" in this video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This provides a dynamic and unpredictable element to the commentary.

### Exaggeration and Absurdity
Commentators frequently use hyperbole to describe game situations or features. Examples include:
*   Exaggerating game queue times as "a little bit over five billion hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Describing a character's jiggle physics as an "ocean" with "jiggle physics times seven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Suggesting that making a character "black" grants a "30% stats boost" to strength and agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Referring to bright in-game lighting as "blinding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> and "overpowered AF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### Self-Deprecating Humor
[[Gamers reactions and commentary | Gamers reactions and commentary]] often involve making light of their own in-game mistakes. For instance, after dying quickly in *Blade & Soul*, the commentator remarks, "five minutes into the game [I'm] already dead guys, very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, and ironically claims to be "obviously MLG MLG optic man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Inappropriate and Edgy Humor
Some [[humor_in_video_games | humor in video games]] can lean into more explicit or edgy territory, including sexual innuendo and offensive remarks. This is seen during character creation with comments like:
*   "These males make me wet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   "You guys can't see how wet I get when I see those lollies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Jokes about being a "pedophile" for character interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Identifying sexually as "Mayor West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Suggesting "anal fisting" as a character uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Alluding to adult content with "get the lotion ready" for male viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Pop Culture References
[[Humorous narration and commentary | Humorous narration and commentary]] often incorporates references to other media, which can resonate with a gaming audience. Examples include:
*   Comparing a character's hair change to "Naruto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   Mentioning the "Purifier from Black Ops 3" during a cutscene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   Drawing parallels between a fight scene and "Naruto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   Mentioning "Clash of Clans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

### Gaming Terminology and Slang
The use of specific gaming terms contributes to the authentic feel of [[gaming_terminology_and_humor_related_to_league_of_legends | gaming terminology and humor]].
*   "Opie" (overpowered) to describe a character's sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   "Rekt" (defeated) used frequently to describe characters or players being beaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

### Direct Audience Engagement
Commentators often directly address the viewers, encouraging interaction and building a connection. For instance, asking for opinions on character choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> or appealing for subscriptions for future content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

Overall, [[funny_moments_in_gaming | funny moments in gaming]] videos are shaped by a combination of personal expression, exaggerated reactions, and shared cultural references within the gaming community, often enhanced by the dynamic between multiple commentators.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 on PC presents several [[challenges_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | challenges]], particularly concerning its optimization and player experience, despite the Call of Duty franchise originating on PC around 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. The game was "undeniably developed for consoles," leading to setbacks for the PC version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## Player Base Limitations

One of the primary [[issues_with_player_base_on_pc_black_ops_3 | issues with player base on PC Black Ops 3]] is its small size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:14">[01:53:14]</a>. This directly impacts the in-game playlist availability, making it difficult to find matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:34">[01:58:34]</a>. Players can generally only find games in Team Deathmatch and Chaos Mosh Pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:06">[02:01:06]</a>. On rare occasions, Free-for-all or Gun Game lobbies might be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:12">[02:09:12]</a>. This is attributed to Activision's successful marketing of the game towards a younger, predominantly console-based audience, resulting in the PC consumer base being neglected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:38">[02:13:38]</a>.

## Aim Assist Inconsistency

A significant issue on PC Black Ops 3 relates to aim assist, or "amissis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>. While mouse and keyboard users do not get aim assist, players who use a controller on PC still receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:48">[02:33:48]</a>. This creates an imbalance due to the inconsistency of hardware use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:49">[02:56:49]</a>.

## Performance and Optimization

Black Ops 3 on PC suffers from optimization problems:
*   **Random Frame Drops** Random frame rate spikes are a common problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:35">[03:12:35]</a>. Even high-end systems, such as one with SLI 980ti GPUs, can experience inconsistent frame rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:34">[03:17:34]</a>. This indicates a definite optimization issue on Treyarch's part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:06">[03:27:06]</a>, suggesting Activision has not properly funded the PC version of newer Call of Duty games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>. An AMD GPU (930 model), considered "fantastic by today's standards," can drop from 60 FPS to less than 15 FPS for several seconds when spawning into maps with too many textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.
*   **Game Loading Issues** Some players encounter severe issues, such as the game not loading past the start menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:05">[04:01:05]</a>. This level of optimization problem is reportedly never found on PS4 or Xbox One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:40">[04:06:40]</a>.

## Weapon Imbalance

The PC version of Black Ops 3 also faces significant [[black_ops_3_weapon_balance_issues_on_pc | weapon balance issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:12">[04:19:12]</a>. Unlike consoles where weapon balance is generally "beautiful" with no single "best gun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, sniper rifles, specifically the Drakon and P-06, are "well overpowered" on PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:06">[04:36:06]</a>. This prevalence of only a few dominant weapons indicates an imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:06">[04:50:06]</a>. The PC community would benefit greatly from dedicated weapon balancing for Black Ops 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:16">[04:59:16]</a>.

Chain Crowd Control (CC) is a gameplay mechanic in [[league_of_legends | League of Legends]] where players coordinate to apply successive crowd control abilities to an enemy, effectively preventing them from performing any actions for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This strategy aims to "chain CC them so hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, disabling opponents and securing advantages in combat.

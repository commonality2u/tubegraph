## Gameplay Reactions
During his *Osu!* session, Xavier frequently vocalizes his [[gamers_reactions_and_commentary | reactions]]:
*   He expresses simple exclamations like "oh man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, repeated again later in the gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   He shows signs of struggle or frustration, stating, "oh my god I'm not getting it there's more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   A positive [[gamers_reactions_and_commentary | reaction]] occurs when he exclaims, "no he's the real MVP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The gameplay session is implied to be extensive, with a title card noting "six hours later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

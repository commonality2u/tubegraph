## Xyz Summoning Strategies
The deck utilizes various monsters and spells to facilitate Xyz Summons, particularly for Level 8 monsters.

### Key Monsters for Xyz Summoning
*   **Parshek** If a Level 8 monster is already controlled, Parshek can be normal summoned without tributing, allowing for a Level 8 Xyz monster on the first turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33">[01:33]</a>.
*   **Dagard** This monster's ability allows for tributing one monster to change another monster's level to 8, which is beneficial for Level 8 Xyz summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02">[03:02]</a>.
*   **Gagaga Magician** Its effect allows it to declare a level from 1 to 8 once per turn, making it highly versatile for Xyz summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13">[03:13]</a>.

### Rank 8 Xyz Monsters
The Extra Deck includes several powerful Rank 8 Xyz monsters:
*   **Thunder End Dragon** This monster can destroy all other monsters on the field by detaching one Xyz material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17">[06:17]</a>.
*   **Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon** (referred to as Tachyon Dragon) It has a great effect and can be summoned using two Blue-Eyes or any two Level 8 monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29">[06:29]</a>.
*   **Hieratic Dragon King of Atum** (referred to as Heriatic Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis) A strong card for destroying opponent's monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39">[06:39]</a>.
*   **Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand** This card can negate effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48">[06:48]</a>.

### Rank 4 Xyz Monsters
While the primary focus is Level 8, one Rank 4 Xyz monster is included:
*   **Queen Dragon Djinn** This card has a useful effect for Dragon-type decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58">[06:58]</a>. It can be found among other [[Rank 4 and Rank 5 Xyz cards in Traptrix deck | Rank 4 and Rank 5 Xyz cards in Traptrix deck]].

## Synchro Summoning Strategies
The deck incorporates specific tuner monsters to facilitate [[Extra Deck and Card Synergies | Synchro]] summons.

### Tuner Monsters
*   **Maiden with Eyes of Blue** A very effective one-star tuner that can special summon a Blue-Eyes White Dragon when targeted by an effect or attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41">[00:41]</a>. It is considered the "main MVP" of the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56">[00:56]</a>. [[Normal summoning tactics in Yosenju deck | Shining Angel]] can be used to easily summon Maiden with Eyes of Blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35">[02:35]</a>.
*   **White Stone of Legend** A great tuner that adds a Blue-Eyes White Dragon to hand when sent to the graveyard, which is useful for discarding or milling strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02">[01:02]</a>.
*   **Rider of the Stormwinds** Included as an extra tuner with a useful effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19">[01:19]</a>.

### Synchro Monsters
The Extra Deck features key Synchro monsters:
*   **Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon** Considered the "MVP of the extra deck," it allows for repeated revival of Blue-Eyes White Dragon and prevents targeted effects on first-turn summoned Dragon-type monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10">[07:10]</a>.
*   **Samsara Dragon of Rebirth** (referred to as Samsara Dragon) This card essentially functions as a Monster Reborn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33">[07:33]</a>.
*   **Trident Dragion** While not considered essential, it can be used with Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon and White Stone of Legend for a potential One-Turn Kill (OTK) in lucky situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41">[07:41]</a>.

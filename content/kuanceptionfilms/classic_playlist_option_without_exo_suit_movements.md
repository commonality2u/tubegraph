Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare introduces a "Classic playlist" option, which allows players to experience the game without the enhanced movement capabilities provided by the Exo Suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This feature caters to players who prefer the traditional ground-based movement from earlier Call of Duty titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Features of the Classic Playlist

In the Classic playlist:
*   Players cannot boost jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   Players cannot double jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   Players cannot "fly around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   Basic Call of Duty functions, such as running around and killing opponents, are still available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   Exo abilities can still be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Rationale and Player Preferences

The inclusion of the Classic playlist is a response to many players who expressed dislike for the "verticality" introduced by Sledgehammer Games in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. This option provides an alternative for those who prefer more limited movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

The speaker personally finds Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare unique due to its Exo Suit movements, which contribute to a fast-paced gameplay experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. They believe the movement system is what makes the game special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Despite this, the speaker acknowledges that many players prefer limited movements and finds the existence of this option "very, very interesting and cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

There is speculation that future Treyarch games, such as Black Ops 3, may not feature the same level of verticality found in Advanced Warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

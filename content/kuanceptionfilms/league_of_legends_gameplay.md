[[League of Legends gameplay]] involves team-based combat, strategic decision-making, and individual skill execution on a map with objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Core Mechanics

### Hooks
The "hook" is a specific ability used by certain champions, notably Thresh, to pull enemies towards the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It can be utilized effectively from level one in a match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Successfully landing a hook can initiate combat or secure a kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Flash
"Flash" is a summoner spell that allows a champion to instantly teleport a short distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It can be used defensively to escape or offensively to engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. A common advanced maneuver is the "flash hook," where a player flashes to get into position for a hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. However, it's possible to flash without landing the subsequent ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Kill Stealing
Within a team, players may sometimes attempt to "steal" a kill from a teammate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This can lead to discussions about resource distribution, though sometimes kills are intentionally given to specific teammates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Objectives and Strategy

### Towers
Teams work to destroy enemy towers (turrets) located in lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Taking down towers provides gold and opens up the map for further advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Farming and Items
Gold is accumulated through last-hitting minions (CS - creep score) and securing kills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This gold is used to purchase items which enhance a champion's abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, the Infinity Edge (IE) is a common damage item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Some champions, like Nasus, may not need as much direct farm if they are scaling well through other means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Champion Roles and Performance

### Role of ADC
The [[role_of_adc_in_league_of_legends | AD Carry (ADC)]] is typically expected to accumulate kills and farm (CS) to become a primary damage dealer in the late game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. A good CS count is important for an ADC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, if a support character (like Thresh) or another role accumulates more kills than the ADC early on, it can impact the ADC's scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Champion Specifics

*   **Thresh:** Can be played in various roles, including a "Thresh carry" build focusing on offensive stats like AD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. An AD Thresh can be very powerful, even reaching "Legendary" status, indicating a high number of kills and good performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Annie:** Can be played in the jungle role, which may surprise some players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A strong Annie player can significantly impact the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Nasus:** Often played in the top lane and scales by accumulating stacks on his abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Jinx:** An AD Carry who relies on itemization, such as the Infinity Edge, to deal significant damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## In-Game Statuses and Interactions

*   **Blinded:** A status effect that causes a champion's basic attacks to miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Healing:** Champions can restore health through abilities or items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Team Communication:** Players may communicate through external voice calls, though sometimes teams are split into different calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

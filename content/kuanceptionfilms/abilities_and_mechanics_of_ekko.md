[[ekko_character_overview|Ekko]], "the Boy Who Shattered Time", is described as a daredevil genius who utilizes his inventions to survive and thrive on the corrupted streets of Zaun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His abilities are designed for both offense and escape, allowing him to manipulate time to his advantage.

## Abilities Overview

### Resonance (Passive)

Triggering Resonance on an enemy champion applies extra damage and a slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It also provides Ekko with a brief bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Parallel Convergence (W)

[[Ekko's W|Ekko's W]] ability is Parallel Convergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, which has both passive and active components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Passive Effect**: [[Ekko's W]] causes his basic attacks to deal extra magic damage to all low-health enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Phase Dive (E)

Phase Dive allows Ekko to pass through terrain with both parts of the ability, granting him significant mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Chrono Break (R)

Chrono Break is Ekko's ultimate ability. When used, [[Ekko]] briefly turns untargetable and invulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Upon reappearing, he heals based on the amount of punishment he has taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## General Mechanics and Utility

[[Ekko]] utilizes a variety of crowd control and other tools alongside his standard attacks, including stuns, snares, and bolos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## [[common_mistakes_in_playing_ekko|Common Mistakes in Playing Ekko]]

A specific combo often leads to being "shrekt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>: if the enemy team heads through a slowing zone and [[Ekko]] uses Chrono Break to put himself back into it without vision, they will likely walk into his stun, but he will still be defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This indicates that using Chrono Break poorly or without proper vision is a way to "not play" [[Ekko]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

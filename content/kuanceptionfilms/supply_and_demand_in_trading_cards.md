Supply and demand are fundamental principles that influence the [[yugioh_card_market_value | value]] of trading cards, including Yu-Gi-Oh! cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The availability of a card directly affects its price, especially if demand remains high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Impact on Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Value

A prime example of supply and demand affecting card [[collectibility_and_value_of_yugioh_cards | value]] is the Fairy Structure Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This deck was purchased for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Online, the Fairy Structure Deck is more expensive than its original retail price because it has not received a reprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The lack of an [[impact_of_reprints_on_yugioh_card_market | impact of reprints on Yugioh card market]] means that the supply of the deck is limited, driving up its [[value_and_rarity_of_yugioh_cards | value]] due to consistent demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

> "The deck never really got a reprint so so the supply and demand you know I'm saying supply and demand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

This scenario highlights how the absence of new supply, such as through [[impact_of_reprints_on_yugioh_card_market | reprints]], can significantly inflate the price of older or desirable products in the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

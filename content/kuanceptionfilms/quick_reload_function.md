*Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare* introduces a "quick reload function" designed to speed up reloads in critical combat situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This new feature allows players to rapidly reload their weapons at the cost of losing any remaining ammunition in the current magazine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## How it Works
To perform a quick reload, players must double-tap the reload button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This action causes the character to empty the current magazine and reload "very very quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. In contrast, a normal reload is performed by simply pressing the reload button once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
The primary advantage of the quick reload is its speed, making it "very very useful in some heated gunfights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, the significant disadvantage is the loss of all remaining ammunition in the magazine being reloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This mechanism is considered more realistic but presents a tactical trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Weapon Compatibility
The quick reload function is demonstrated with various weapons, including:
*   **IMR** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   **ASM1** (submachine gun) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

The feature is described as a "really really cool new function" in *Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

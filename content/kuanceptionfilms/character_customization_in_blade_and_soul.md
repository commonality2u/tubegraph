This process is undertaken when [[starting_the_game_and_choosing_a_character | creating a new character]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Initial Choices: Race and Class

Players begin by selecting a race and class for their character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Available classes include:

Hair customization is a detailed aspect, including:

*   **Hair color**: Options like blue, green, and white hair are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The brightness of hair colors can be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Facial hair density**: An option for adjusting facial hair density is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

While the core [[yosenju_budget_deck_profile | Yosenju Budget Deck Profile]] can be built for under $30 by disregarding the Extra Deck, some cards are recommended for this part of the deck, though they can increase the overall cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The Yosenju deck typically doesn't heavily rely on special summoning, making the Extra Deck less crucial but still offering strategic options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Recommended Extra Deck Cards

### Lightning Chidori
Lightning Chidori is a highly effective card for the Yosenju Extra Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. It requires two Level 4 Wind monsters to summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Its effect allows you to send multiple cards back to your opponent's deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. While powerful and "abused in this deck" if summoned, it can be an expensive card to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> and might not be used frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King
This card is valuable for its ability to search out Fire Formation - Tenki, a spell card that boosts Beast-Warrior monsters and allows searching for Yosenju monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Though it might not see constant use, it's beneficial to have for its utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon provides significant offensive power, particularly when high attack strength is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Number 101: Silent Honor ARK
Considered an essential Rank 4 monster, Silent Honor ARK is a valuable addition to the Extra Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer
Similar to Silent Honor ARK, Castel is another essential and beneficial Rank 4 monster to include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Gagaga Cowboy
Gagaga Cowboy is potentially the best Rank 4 monster for the Yosenju deck due to its versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   In attack position, it can gain attack points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   In defense position, it can inflict 800 points of damage directly to the opponent, which can be crucial for securing a win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

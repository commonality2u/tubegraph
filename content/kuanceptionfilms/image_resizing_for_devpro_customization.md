When adding custom content like card sleeves or backgrounds to Yu-Gi-Oh DevPro, image resizing is an important consideration to ensure the visuals display correctly within the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Importance of Correct Sizing
Using an incorrectly sized image can lead to a distorted appearance for your [[custom_sleeves_for_yugioh_devpro | custom sleeves]] or [[custom_backgrounds_for_yugioh_devpro | custom backgrounds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Fortunately, DevPro includes a feature to automatically resize images when you add them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Resizing Process for Custom Sleeves
To add [[custom_sleeves_for_yugioh_devpro | custom sleeves]] in Yu-Gi-Oh DevPro, you must first navigate to the "Customize" tab from the game list, then select "Content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

1.  Select "Player One Covers" to customize sleeves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  Click the "Add" button to select your desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
3.  When prompted to resize the image to the correct size, select "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
4.  After the image is added and resized, right-click on the newly added sleeve and select "Install" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
5.  You can then select "Preview" to see the customized sleeves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Resizing Process for Custom Wallpapers and Backgrounds
The process for adding and resizing [[custom_backgrounds_for_yugioh_devpro | custom backgrounds]] is similar to adding sleeves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

1.  From the "Customize" tab, select "Backgrounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  Click "Add" and choose your wallpaper image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
3.  When the prompt appears to resize the image to the correct size, confirm by selecting "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
4.  Right-click on the added background and select "Install" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
5.  To change the in-game background (as opposed to the main menu background), go to "Game Backgrounds" within the "Customize" tab and follow the same "Add" and "Install" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
6.  Use the "Preview" option to view the installed background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

This automatic resizing feature ensures that your chosen images fit correctly within the Yu-Gi-Oh DevPro interface, preventing distortion and allowing for a visually appealing customization experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

The experience of playing video games often revolves around the player's desire for enjoyment and their motivation to continue playing. Players sometimes express a deliberate choice between having fun or opting for a less enjoyable, but perhaps necessary, approach to gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This internal debate can focus on achieving "the most fun" or even intentionally choosing "no fun" if a particular task demands it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

To enhance the gameplay experience and foster motivation, players might utilize specific methods to get "in the mood" for a session, suggesting a ritualistic or preparatory aspect to engaging with games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This preparation can be a form of [[reaction_to_video_games]].

However, certain [[gaming_challenges]] or roles within games can be highly demotivating. A player might strongly declare, "I'm not going jungle ever again in my life," after a presumably negative experience with that specific role or playstyle, indicating a strong [[reaction_to_video_games]] that impacts future motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

On July 16, 2015, the Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden/Unlimited List became effective, including a ban on the card Djinn Releaser of Rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This decision sparked significant discussion and frustration within the community.

## The Ban

Djinn Releaser of Rituals was moved to the forbidden list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This move was made in the context of needing to "nerf" the [[Effect on Necroz and popular decks | Necroz]] archetype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Community Reaction and Impact

The decision to ban Djinn Releaser of Rituals was met with strong disapproval from some players. Critics argued that Konami should have targeted [[Effect on Necroz and popular decks | Necroz]] cards directly by limiting or banning specific cards within that archetype, rather than banning Djinn Releaser of Rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

The card had been a staple for many years, supporting numerous ritual decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Its ban was seen as negatively impacting a wide range of ritual-based strategies, effectively "screwing lots of decks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The sentiment was that Konami should have "hit [[Effect on Necroz and popular decks | Necroz]] itself" instead of an ancillary card that benefited many different strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

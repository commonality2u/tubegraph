## Promo Cards
Two [[card_types_and_rarities_like_secret_rare_and_promo_cards | foil promo cards]] are included in the blister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   One [[card_types_and_rarities_like_secret_rare_and_promo_cards | promo card]] is "Dark Hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The "Instant Fusion" card is highlighted as one of the best possible [[card_types_and_rarities_like_secret_rare_and_promo_cards | promo cards]] due to its utility in building "rank four decks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> and its synergy with "Norden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

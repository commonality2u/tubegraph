Effective [[team_communication_in_games | team communication]] and coordination are crucial for success in multiplayer games. Players often discuss plans and assess the opponent's strategy to gain an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Aspects of Team Coordination

*   **Organization**: A lack of organization can be a significant hurdle for a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Conversely, observing an opponent's high level of organization can highlight its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Strategic Planning**: Teams may plan their [[game_strategy | game strategy]], such as focusing on a specific objective like "testing the dragon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, or considering how their "[[game_strategy | farm]]" and specific team compositions might lead to a "[[game_strategy | late game]]" win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Role Fulfillment and Support**: Players may identify specific team members, such as "Calista" or "the big toe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, and take on supportive roles, like ensuring a teammate doesn't die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Collective Action**: Direct calls for collective action, such as "everybody in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> or "everyone look down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, demonstrate immediate attempts at coordinating player movements and focus.
*   **Team Composition**: A team's composition, like "We got the rich the ritz flight," can contribute to a "good feeling" among players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

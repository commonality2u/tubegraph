Victor of Conception Films presents a video featuring the [[yugioh_pack_opening_experience | opening of a Yugioh video]] [00:00:25] [00:00:27]. This particular event focuses on a Primal Origin Korean OCG booster box [00:00:30] [00:00:33].

## Participants and Appreciation
Victor is joined by William for the unboxing [00:00:49]. A significant shout-out is given to Min Soo Kim, who generously provided the booster box as an early birthday present, described as "such a good man" [00:00:42] [00:00:54] [00:05:03]. The booster box is stated to mean "the life" to the opener [00:00:59].

## The Booster Box: Primal Origin Korean OCG
The unboxing commences with the Primal Origin set [00:01:03]. Initial hopes for pulls include Bujin cards and Galaxy-Eyes Photon cards [00:01:22] [00:01:26].

### Initial Opening Challenges
Opening the box proved difficult [00:01:30]. The box appeared "pretty smashed" from being tossed, making it hard to open [00:01:46] [00:01:49]. It took approximately 20 minutes to successfully open the booster box [00:01:54] [00:02:00] [00:02:02].

### Pack Count
After opening, it was discovered the box contained 40 booster packs [00:02:03] [00:02:17] [00:02:21]. Figuring out the number of packs took about seven minutes [00:02:23] [00:02:26]. The "OCG packs have a build quality" described as "above average" [00:07:38] [00:07:41].

*   A theory that the way a pack is ripped affects the pull was tested [00:05:48] [00:05:50] [00:05:51] [00:05:55].
*   Some packs were "double-packed" or "double-cut" [00:10:41] [00:10:43].

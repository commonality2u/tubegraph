Ekko's abilities often incorporate his theme of time manipulation and swift movement:
*   **Resonance**: Triggering Resonance on an enemy champion applies extra damage and a slow, and also briefly provides Ekko with a boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Parallel Convergence (W)**: This ability has both passive and active components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Passively, Ekko's basic attacks deal additional magic damage to low-health enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Phase Dive**: Ekko can pass through terrain using both parts of this ability, enabling significant mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Chronobreak (R)**: When Ekko uses Chronobreak, he briefly becomes untargetable and invulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Upon reappearing, he heals based on the amount of punishment he has taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Crowd Control**: Ekko possesses a variety of crowd control options and other tools, such as stuns, snares, and bolos, which complement his standard attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Ekko's kit allows for quick engagements and disengagements:
*   He is effective at isolating and eliminating enemies who are positioned away from their team, allowing him to get in for a kill and escape before the enemy team can react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   A specific combo involves using Chronobreak to re-enter a slowing zone created by the enemy team, potentially leading to a stun if they walk into it without vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

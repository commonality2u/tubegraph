Heroes of the Storm features diverse [[gameplay_mechanics_and_item_usage|gameplay mechanics]] and character abilities. This article focuses on the character Murky and the Battlefield of Eternity map.

## Murky: Abilities and Playstyle

Murky is a unique character in *Heroes of the Storm*, notable for his distinct abilities and playstyle. The player demonstrates being a "pretty decent murky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> with experience from 39 games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, having achieved a 26-13 record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> and reaching level 8 with the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Core Mechanics

*   **Mana-less Gameplay**: Murky does not use mana, allowing players to spam his abilities freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Death Mechanic**: Murky's death is less impactful than other heroes. He often describes his deaths as not a "big deal at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> because "it doesn't really matter how much you die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a> due to his rapid respawn from his egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

### Playstyle and Strategy

The player's Murky playstyle is characterized as "a little bit objective but mostly pushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. A primary goal for each game is to achieve at least 100,000 siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, aiming to out-siege all other players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

The player emphasizes staying alive as Murky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, contrasting with a "suicidal murky" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This involves strategic use of abilities for escape and survival.

### Murky Builds and Talents

The player primarily uses a "bubble build Murky" or "bubble bubble old Murky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, which focuses on bubbling and seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Specific talents and abilities mentioned include:

*   **Bubble Breeze**: A talent taken for the "bubble build" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Envenom**: Chosen for dealing damage, especially against "squishies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The player also builds Murky as an assassin to "simply murky combo them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Compressed Air**: A talent taken for "maximum siege" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> and hitting all towers at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, particularly effective with Pufferfish to clear an "entire base type thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Octo-Grab**: Murky's ultimate ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, described as having an "incredibly low" cooldown of 45-52 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>.
*   **Rejuvenating Bubble**: A level 16 talent for the bubble build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, providing "insane" healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Fish Slap**: An ability that can be taken to increase damage on "slime targets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> and can reach approximately 300 damage per whack with increased damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

### Key Abilities in Practice

*   **Safety Bubble (E)**: This ability makes Murky invulnerable and grants him movement speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. It is crucial for survival, especially against crowd control abilities like knock-ups or snares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Effective use of Safety Bubble requires "pretty good reaction times" and knowing the enemy heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   **Pufferfish (W)**: Murky places a Pufferfish that deals area-of-effect damage. With Compressed Air, it can hit multiple structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. A "pufferfish decreased cool down" talent is mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, and there is also a "slimey pufferfish" talent that casts slime at the pufferfish location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Slime (Q)**: Murky's primary damaging ability, often used in combos.

## Battlefield of Eternity Map Mechanics

The game takes place on the "Battlefield of Eternity," described as a "new map" or "slightly new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, having been released a few weeks prior to the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

*   **Map Objective: Immortals**: The primary objective on this map involves fighting "Immortals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Two-Lane Map**: Unlike most other *Heroes of the Storm* maps that typically have three lanes, Battlefield of Eternity features only two lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. This impacts Murky's typical strategy of constantly pushing a lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

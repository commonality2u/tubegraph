The commentary begins with the player introducing a video about playing *Pokemon* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The game starts with the traditional introduction from Professor Oak, who explains that the world is inhabited by creatures called "Pokemon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The player reacts to this dialogue, questioning if Pokemon are simply animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Player Character Selection
During the initial setup, the player chooses their character's gender, stating a preference for being a girl "for now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Following this, the player names their character "69" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Pokemon Selection
Professor Oak also explains that Pokemon live in tall grass and players need their own Pokemon for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The player perceives this concept as making Pokemon "slaves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The player then proceeds to choose a starter Pokemon. Having used all other options in previous playthroughs, they decide to pick Squirtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. They then choose to name their Squirtle "slave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## First Battle
Immediately after selecting and naming their Pokemon, the player's rival, "169," challenges them to a battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The player expresses frustration at being challenged so aggressively right after starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The player later comments on the difficulty of this first battle, describing it as "a freaking Turtle against a rat" and recalling how they found it "impossible" the first time they played the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

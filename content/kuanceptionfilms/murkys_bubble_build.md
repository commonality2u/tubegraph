This article details the "Bubble Build" strategy for playing [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]] in Heroes of the Storm, focusing on its effectiveness, key talents, and associated playstyle. This build emphasizes survivability and siege damage, making [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]] a potent lane pusher.

## Overview
The "Bubble Build" for [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]] is described as the optimal choice for the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This playstyle focuses heavily on pushing lanes and less on objective control, although the player will engage with objectives when convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. A primary goal for each game when using this build is to achieve at least 100,000 siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Key Talents and Abilities

### Bubble Breeze (Level 1)
This talent is chosen at level 1 to support the "Bubble Build" playstyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Health Regen (General)
[[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]]'s health regeneration has been significantly buffed, especially when returning to the "sippy cup" (likely referring to the base or a regen globe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Envenom (Level 7)
Chosen at level 7, Envenom is part of an "assassin" secondary focus to deal with enemies who try to stop [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]]'s pushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This allows for a "[[murky_gameplay_commentary | Murky]] combo" using Q (Slime) and W (Pufferfish) along with Envenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Compressed Air (Level 13)
This talent significantly enhances the Pufferfish ability, allowing it to hit all towers at once for "maximum siege" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. It's noted for its "super siege" and "super duper" hitting capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. With Compressed Air, [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]] can clear an entire base structure with a single Pufferfish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Rejuvenating Bubble (Level 16)
At level 16, Rejuvenating Bubble is selected for its healing properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This contrasts with "Slimey Pufferfish," which was previously taken for increased damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Octo-Grab (Ultimate)
This ultimate ability is chosen for its utility in securing kills and disrupting enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:34]</a>. Its cooldown is notably low at around 45-52 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:28:03]</a>.

## Playstyle Tips
*   **Prioritize Pushing:** The core of this build is pushing lanes, especially the bottom lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The player aims to "reak havoc on the bottom lane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:02:00]</a> and focuses on siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Maintain Bubble Availability:** Always try to have your bubble (Safety Bubble) ready, especially if the enemy has crowd control like knock-ups or snares, to ensure survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:23]</a>. This "bubbling a lot" is central to the build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Avoid Suicidal Play:** Unlike some [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]] players, the "Bubble Build" advocate prefers to stay alive rather than constantly dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Strategic Egg Placement:** Place the egg in inconspicuous locations, such as behind a fort, to avoid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:21]</a> and ensure quick respawns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Mana-less Abilities:** [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]] doesn't use mana, allowing for constant spamming of abilities like Pufferfish (W) and Slime (Q) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Target Selection:** [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]] is effective against heroes like Kael'thas, Jaina, Kerrigan, Nova, and Illidan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Movement Speed:** Picking up talents that grant 20% move speed helps prevent enemies from easily chasing and killing [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **Adapt to Map:** On maps with only two lanes (like Battlefield of Eternity), [[strategies_for_playing_murky | Murky]] may need to engage more with objectives than on typical three-lane maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:48]</a>.

The response of major gaming networks, specifically [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live and PlayStation Network]], to hacking incidents has been a point of contention among users and commentators.

## Perceived Vulnerability and Inability to Defend

[[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live and PlayStation Network]] were described as already being "pretty crappy Network Services to begin with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Over several weeks, both networks experienced consistent downtime due to constant hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The group [[lizard_squad_hacking_incident | Lizard Squad]] claimed responsibility for these "pointless hacks" on PSN and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The lack of effective defense by Sony and Microsoft, who manage "the two largest gaming networks in the world," against these groups was questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. [[lizard_squad_hacking_incident | Lizard Squad]] frequently tweeted threats to Sony and Microsoft, promising to take down PSN and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live]], and they were successful "almost every time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Continued Vulnerability Despite Claims of Neutralization

A separate group of hackers, "the finest Squad," reportedly claimed to have taken down [[lizard_squad_hacking_incident | Lizard Squad]] approximately a week prior to a specific incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. However, this claim was cast into doubt when [[lizard_squad_hacking_incident | Lizard Squad]] successfully took down PSN and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live]] again on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The hacks were perceived as being carried out without any particular "good reason" or specific motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

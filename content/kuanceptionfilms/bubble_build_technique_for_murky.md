The "Bubble build" is a prominent gameplay technique for [[gameplay_strategies_for_playing_as_murky_in_heroes_of_the_storm | Murky]] in Heroes of the Storm, often referred to as "bubble bubble old Murky" by some players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This build emphasizes the heavy use of Murky's bubble abilities, prioritizing survival and high siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Core Philosophy and Playstyle
The primary goal of the bubble build is to constantly bubble and seek opportunities for siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. A realistic goal for every game when employing this build is at least 100,000 siege damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Unlike a "suicidal Murky" playstyle, the bubble build focuses on staying alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Players aim to always have their bubble ready, especially if the enemy team has heroes with knock-ups or snares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Bubbling effectively allows Murky to escape dangerous situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Key Talents and Abilities

### Bubble Breeze (Level 1)
This talent is taken at Level 1 to initiate the bubble build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. It's considered the best choice over other options like Bribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Rejuvenating Bubble (Level 16)
At Level 16, "rejuvenating bubble" is the preferred choice for this build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This provides insane health regeneration, making Murky even more resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

### Other Abilities and Combos
While primarily focused on the bubble, the build integrates other abilities for damage and disruption:
*   **Pufferfish (W)**: Essential for high siege damage, especially with "compressed air" at Level 7 for maximum area-of-effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. It can hit entire base structures with one cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Slime (Q)**: Used frequently to apply pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
*   **Octo-Grab (R)**: Murky's ultimate ability, used for locking down and killing enemy heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It has a surprisingly low cooldown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
*   **Q-W-R Combo**: Referred to as the "Q-W-Ultimate Death Arena combo," this sequence allows Murky to burst down enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Assassin Talents**: Sometimes, an assassin focus (e.g., "envenom" at Level 4) is incorporated to deal with enemies who try to stop Murky's pushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Strategic Considerations

*   **Egg Placement**: Strategic placement of Murky's egg is crucial for quick respawns and continued lane pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Lane Pushing**: The build excels at pushing lanes and structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The objective of winning a game with Murky often involves destroying enemy forts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
*   **Objective Play**: While Murky's main strength is pushing, it's acknowledged that he can also contribute to objectives, especially on maps like Battlefield of Eternity with only two lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.
*   **Matchups**: Murky is noted to be effective against heroes like Kael'thas, Jaina, Kerrigan, Nova, and Illidan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Reaction Time**: Good reaction time is essential for effectively using Murky's bubble to counter enemy abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

A significant problem identified within the [[player_base_issues_for_call_of_duty_games_on_pc | PC community]] of *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* concerns weapon balance, particularly the overwhelming prevalence of specific weapons [00:00:14].

## The Problem: Weapon Imbalance

On PC, players frequently encounter lobbies where the Drakon and P-06 sniper rifles are overwhelmingly used [00:00:34]. It's estimated that three-fourths of players in any given PC lobby are "spamming" these two weapons [00:00:42]. While the speaker expresses no inherent issue with sniper rifles and finds them satisfying to use, their widespread use on PC highlights a weapon balance problem [00:00:48].

This dominance of specific weapons leads to a lack of variety in gameplay, making matches predictable and less enjoyable [00:01:42]. Players desire variety and the ability to have fun without constantly encountering the same engagements from Drakon and P-06 users [00:01:46]. The situation has been likened to repeatedly playing the "Combine" map; while a good map, constant repetition makes it undesirable [00:01:36].

### Console vs. PC Weapon Balance

In contrast to the PC experience, weapon balance on consoles is generally considered to be "on point" and effective [00:01:12]. Although some console players might believe sniper rifles are balanced and not problematic, the PC environment shows snipers "overpopulating" and "oversaturating" the game with spam [00:02:15]. This imbalance also extends to shotguns, which, alongside sniper rifles, contribute to a "mess" on PC [00:02:33].

## Proposed Solution: Dedicated PC Weapon Balancing

The core issue stems from how these weapons were optimized for console player usage [00:02:56]. The speaker asserts that it is not the players' fault when the company promotes certain weapons by giving them better stats, especially if those stats are tailored for a different platform [00:02:45].

There is a clear [[need_for_dedicated_pc_weapon_balancing_in_black_ops_3 | need for dedicated PC weapon balancing]] [00:01:21]. This would involve implementing specific weapon statistics solely for the PC community to address the current imbalance [00:03:06]. Such an adjustment, according to the speaker, is a "very simple concept" and should not be difficult for developers like Treyarch to implement [00:03:13]. The speaker urges Treyarch to consider this change, suggesting that community figures like Drifter, who cares about the community, might support this idea [00:03:19].

Within the *Yu-Gi-Oh!* card game, the Legendary God Cards are a highly sought-after set of powerful monster cards. Their appearance in a "Value Cube" unboxing was noted as a significant surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, given the relatively low cost of the product, which was priced around $8.99 or $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Discovery within a Value Cube

A "Value Cube" unboxing revealed a "promo pack" described as a "legendary God's collection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This specific "foil pack" was identified as typically accompanying "legendary collection one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, despite the "Value Cube" stating it contained 25 cards and two booster packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The inclusion of these cards was described as "unbelievable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> and "very cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## The Legendary God Cards Pulled

The "awesome foil pack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> from the "Value Cube" notably contained the following Legendary God Cards:
*   Obelisk the Tormentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   Slifer the Sky Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>
*   The Winged Dragon of Ra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>

These cards were accompanied by other classic ultra rare cards like Blue-Eyes White Dragon, Dark Magician, and Red-Eyes Black Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The presence of these cards, especially the God Cards, made the "Value Cube" seem "valuable indeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, contributing to the [[significance_of_various_yugioh_cards | significance of various YuGiOh cards]]. Their unexpected appearance within a cheap product highlights the [[chasing_rare_yugioh_cards | pursuit of rare YuGiOh cards]] and the [[value_and_rarity_of_yugioh_cards | value and rarity of YuGiOh cards]].

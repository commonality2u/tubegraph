The game [[blade_and_soul_game_overview | Blade and Soul]], a new MMORPG, allows players to create and customize their characters extensively upon starting the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Getting Started
After launching the game, players are prompted to create a new character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Class and Race Selection
Players can choose from different classes, including Assassin, Blade Master, or Kung Fu Master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The player in the video opts for the Blade Master, noting it seems "the least difficult to play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The choice of race is also available, with the player selecting a "mainstream Jen female Blade Master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Appearance Customization
The [[gameplay_mechanics_and_graphics_of_blade_and_soul | character customization]] options are robust, allowing for detailed adjustments to appearance:
*   **Hair:** Players can change hair length, style, and color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Some hairstyles are noted to be "intense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Facial Features:** Options include changing facial types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> and adding facial decorations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Characters can also have their lip gloss percentage adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Body Type:** Players can modify the character's body type and height, with some changes being quite significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Jiggle Physics:** A notable [[gameplay_mechanics_and_graphics_of_blade_and_soul | graphics]] feature mentioned is the "jiggle physics," which is exaggerated and adjustable based on computer specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Gameplay Implications of Customization
Player commentary suggests that choosing a black character model might provide a "30% stats boost" in strength, agility, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This is presented as a significant advantage during [[character_roles_and_builds | character roles and builds]].

After completing the customization, players proceed to name their character and select a server to begin playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The player names their character "Conception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

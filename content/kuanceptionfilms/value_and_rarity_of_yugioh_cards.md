Understanding the [[yugioh_card_market_value | market value]] and rarity of [[Collectibility and value of YuGiOh cards | YuGiOh cards]] is a key aspect of [[Collecting ultra rare YuGiOh cards | collecting]] and playing the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While some cards may not hold significant monetary value, others can be highly sought after due to their rarity, historical significance, or playability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Unboxing and Card Contents
Value Cubes, such as the Tank Value Cube, often promise specific contents like 25 cards and two booster packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. However, the actual contents can be misleading, with some structure decks included containing more than the advertised 25 cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. These cubes can offer a surprising variety of cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a> and are relatively inexpensive, typically around $8.99 to $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### Contents of a Sample Value Cube
A typical Value Cube might contain:
*   A promo card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   One promo pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   Two booster packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   One structure deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Card Rarity and Value Examples
The rarity of a card often dictates its [[yugioh_card_market_value | market value]]. Different types of packs and products yield different rarities and overall [[Collectibility and value of YuGiOh cards | collectibility]].

### Elemental Hero The Shining
This card is a classic Hero card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. While it is still considered "very cool to pull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, it is "not worth too much on the market right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Despite its low value, it can be a good addition to a Hero deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### Legendary God's Collection Promo Pack
This foil pack often contains highly sought-after and iconic cards, including:
*   Obelisk the Tormentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>
*   Slifer the Sky Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>
*   The Winged Dragon of Ra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>
*   [[Ultra Rare and Secret Rare Cards | Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] (Ultra Rare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>
*   [[Ultra Rare and Secret Rare Cards | Dark Magician]] (Ultra Rare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>
*   Red-Eyes Black Dragon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>

Pulling these "classic cards" from a Value Cube can be an "unbelievable" surprise, highlighting the potential for significant pulls even from affordable products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

### Booster Packs
*   **Abyss Rising:** While there's always a chance for a foil, it's not always expected from this pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Secrets of Eternity:** This pack can yield foil cards, such as a "Void Launch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, or rare cards like a "Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Even if not highly valuable, pulling a foil is "very cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Structure Decks
The Geargia Structure Deck, for example, is described as containing "pretty dank cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a> and "some real nice stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. While the archetype's appearance might not appeal to everyone ("looked like a hot mess because they're so ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>), it was "a pleasing archetype" and "almost topping" in the past, making the deck "pretty poppin'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. These decks often include useful common and rare cards that are "very usable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

Such decks can include:
*   Gear Gigant XG (Xyz card) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>
*   Geargiano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>
*   Geargiano Mk-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>
*   Geargia Attacker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>
*   Gadget monsters (Green, Red, Yellow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>
*   Support cards like Limiter Removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, Smashing Ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, and Terraforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

## Considerations for Collectors
Even cards with low [[yugioh_card_market_value | market value]] can be valuable to a player for [[Fermenting YuGiOh decks for rarity | deck building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a> or for their [[Significance of Various YuGiOh Cards | significance]] as classic pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. The element of surprise from a [[yugioh_value_box_opening | value box opening]] makes it an exciting experience for [[chasing_rare_yugioh_cards | chasing rare YuGiOh cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

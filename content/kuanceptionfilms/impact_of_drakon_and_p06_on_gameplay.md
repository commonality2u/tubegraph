The Drakon and P06 sniper rifles significantly impact the [[gameplay experience]] on *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* on PC, leading to a perceived weapon balance issue within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Dominance of Drakon and P06 on PC

On PC, the Drakon and P06 are almost exclusively used by players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It is reported that in any given lobby, three-fourths of the players are "spamming" the Drakon, and a similar proportion are "spamming" the P06 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This overuse creates an environment where players constantly face "a mess of sniper rifles and shotguns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

While sniper rifles can be satisfying and good for a *Call of Duty* game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, their widespread use on PC highlights a weapon balance problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The community's desire for variety is unmet when every game is predictable, with players frequently being shot from all angles by these weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This lack of weapon diversity makes the game feel like "Call of Duty P06" or "Call of Duty Drakon" rather than *Call of Duty: Black Ops 3* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Comparison to Console Weapon Balance

On console, the weapon balance is generally considered "on point" and effective, for which Treyarch is applauded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Console players tend to believe sniper rifles are balanced and not an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. However, on PC, these snipers are described as "overpopulating" and "oversaturating" the game with spam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Root Cause and Proposed Solution

The primary reason these weapons are problematic on PC is that they were "optimized for console player usage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The argument is that Treyarch, the developers, are promoting certain weapons by giving them better stats, which is not the fault of the players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The proposed solution is for Treyarch to implement dedicated weapon balancing specifically for the PC community, which would involve unique weapon stats optimized for PC gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This is presented as a simple concept that should not be difficult for developers to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

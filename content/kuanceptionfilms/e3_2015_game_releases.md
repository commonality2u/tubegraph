E3 2015 was described as "pretty interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, although the speaker initially found the game releases to be "pretty generic" and lacked excitement for any particular game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Notable Announcements

The most significant announcement during E3 2015, according to the speaker, was the reveal of a "Final Fantasy 7 remake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This announcement was highlighted as a "very special treat for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The 2015 December [[traptrix_gravekeeper_deck_profile | Traptrix]] "Ring Force Spam" deck focuses on quickly summoning [[rank_4_and_rank_5_xyz_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Rank 4 and Rank 5 Xyz cards]] and maintaining a strong [[building_an_effective_back_row_defense_in_traptrix_deck | back row defense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. The monster lineup is crucial for achieving these objectives, providing search capabilities, special summoning power, and combat utility.

## Key Monster Cards

### Traptrix Myrmeleo
Three copies of Traptrix Myrmeleo are included in the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   **Search Power**: This card allows players to search for "Bottomless Trap Hole" or any other "Trap Hole" card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This provides crucial access to [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | trap card strategies]] and [[important_spell_and_trap_cards | important spell and trap cards]] for the deck's defensive core.
*   **Removal Effect**: When special summoned from the graveyard, Myrmeleo can destroy any spell or trap card on the field, effectively acting as a "Mystical Space Typhoon" (MST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

### Traptrix Dionaea
Three copies of Traptrix Dionaea are run in the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Graveyard Special Summon**: Dionaea can special summon any "Traptrix" monster from the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Trap Hole Reuse**: When special summoned from the graveyard, Dionaea allows the reuse of "Trap Hole" cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This synergy with Myrmeleo, which searches "Trap Hole" cards, enhances the deck's consistency and prolonged control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### Assault Halberd
Three copies of Assault Halberd are also included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Easy Special Summon**: This card can be special summoned if the player controls no monsters and the opponent controls a monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, making it an effective way to establish board presence.
*   **Search and Combat**: When it attacks and deals damage, Assault Halberd allows the player to add another "Assault Halberd" from their deck to their hand, providing an automatic search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. It has 1000 ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a> and inflicts piercing damage when attacking defense position monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. It is also a Level 4 monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, contributing to the [[rank_4_and_rank_5_xyz_cards_in_traptrix_deck | Rank 4 Xyz plays]] of the deck.

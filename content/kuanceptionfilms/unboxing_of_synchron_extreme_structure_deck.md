## Value and Recommendation

The [[yugioh_synchron_extreme_japanese_structure_deck | Synchron Extreme Japanese Structure Deck]] is priced at approximately $20 on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. If purchased in America, it ships from Japan, unless Amazon Prime is used, which allows for two-day shipping from a US facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

This deck is highly recommended for Synchro deck users, especially those who enjoy "pulling out the quasars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. The inclusion of various [[structure_deck_and_reprints | reprints]] like [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Solemn Judgment]], [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Imperial Iron Wall]], and [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Scrap Iron Scarecrow]] is appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. The presence of two Junk Synchrons is considered essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>, and the [[structure_deck_and_reprints | reprints]] of [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Plague Spreader]] and [[structure_deck_and_reprints | Doppel Warrior]], which haven't been printed frequently, are also welcomed additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

4.  **Preview**: Click "Preview" to load a replay and view the installed in-game background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. You can switch between different installed wallpapers by right-clicking and installing them again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Verifying Customizations in a Duel

To confirm that both your [[custom_sleeves_for_yugioh_devpro | custom sleeves]] and [[custom_backgrounds_for_yugioh_devpro | custom backgrounds]] are correctly applied, start an actual duel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Both should appear formatted correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

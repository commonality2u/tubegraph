## Value Assessment

Despite the misleading information on the packaging, a [[Yugioh value cube contents and value | YuGiOh value cube]] containing the Gravekeeper's deck, purchased for $9.99, was considered worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The Gravekeeper's deck itself was noted to be "pretty pricey on the [[Yugioh card market value | secondary market]] today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The inclusion of strong common cards like Mirror Force, Book of Moon, Mystical Space Typhoon, Foolish Burial, and Necrovalley further contributed to its perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

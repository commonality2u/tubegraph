Effective [[strategic_team_coordination | team coordination]] is crucial for success in gameplay, involving clear communication and a shared understanding of objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Key Aspects of Team Strategy

*   **Late Game Planning** Teams often consider their late-game strategy, such as stacking "titles" to secure a win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Role Assignment and Support** Players offer support to teammates, ensuring survival during critical moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Coordinated Engagements** Calls like "everybody in" prompt synchronized team actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Team Composition** Consideration is given to diversifying the team with different "people" or roles, possibly through mechanics like clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Objective Focus** Teams engage in specific objectives, such as "testing the dragon," requiring all members to focus on a particular area or action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

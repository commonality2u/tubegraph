Within the game, various items and technological elements are present, impacting [[ingame_events_and_actions | gameplay]] and character interactions.

## Recovering Items
Players can acquire [[ingame_events and_actions | items]] within the game, such as a potion, which a player humorously imagines grabbing directly from their computer screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This potion is used for healing or other benefits during [[ingame_events_and_actions | gameplay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Game Speed Control
The game allows for adjustment of its speed, with a player noting the game is "so slow" and opting to "make it faster speed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This feature can be used to improve the [[gaming_performance_and_technical_challenges | gaming experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Ingame Devices and Professor Oak's Dialogue
Non-player characters (NPCs) often provide information related to the game's world and its features. Professor Oak, an NPC, discusses "technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The game also features a "PC" (Personal Computer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, which is an interactive element within the game world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Pokemon as Assets
Pokemon are presented as creatures that inhabit the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and are given to players for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A player may choose a specific Pokemon, such as Squirtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, and can name them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, treating them as personal assets or "slaves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Players can later "train" their Pokemon to improve their abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, contributing to [[handling_ingame_challenges | gameplay challenges]].

## Seeking Free Items
Throughout the game, players may interact with NPCs or search for "free stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, indicating a desire to acquire items without cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

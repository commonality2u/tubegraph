Players engage in various [[Ingame strategies and tactics | in-game strategies and tactics]] during gameplay, sometimes inviting aggression from opponents.

## Player Actions and Counters
A player may dare an opponent to "come in" on them, which can lead to the opponent dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If an opponent attempts to kill the player, it can result in a "free chill" (an easy kill) for the player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. There might be instances where players wish an ally would "just let me attack" ("ATT"), suggesting a desired cooperation in [[game strategy | game strategy]] or a complaint about an ally's hindering [[Ingame action sequences | in-game actions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Player Conduct and Complaints
Negative [[multiplayer strategies | multiplayer strategies]] or behaviors from other players, such as those attributed to a player named "Lucien," can lead to complaints and calls for reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Key Monsters and Their Synergies

The core of the strategy revolves around bringing out multiple copies of [[key_monsters_in_blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck | Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] and its support monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

*   **Blue-Eyes White Dragon**
    *   The main monster the deck relies on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
    *   It is recommended to run three copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Maiden with Eyes of Blue**
    *   A crucial one-star tuner and the "main MVP" of the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   Its effect allows you to special summon a [[key_monsters_in_blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck | Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] directly from the hand, Deck, or graveyard when it's targeted by an effect or attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   Three copies are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **White Stone of Legend**
    *   A great tuner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   When sent to the graveyard, it adds a [[key_monsters_in_blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck | Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] from your Deck to your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This is useful for discarding abilities or milling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   Three copies are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Kaibaman**
    *   Mentioned as part of the deck, often used to tribute itself to summon [[key_monsters_in_blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck | Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Parsek, the Dark Ruler**
    *   Can be normal summoned without tributing if you control a Level 8 monster, such as [[key_monsters_in_blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck | Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   This facilitates an easy first-turn Level 8 Xyz Summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Dark Storm Dragon**
    *   An alternative Level 8 monster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   It is a Gemini card, treated as a Normal Monster while on the field or in the graveyard, which can have additional synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon**
    *   Has an ability similar to [[extra_deck_recommendations_for_blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck | Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   Easily special summoned by banishing one Dragon-Type monster from your side of the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Shining Angel**
    *   Used to summon [[key_monsters_in_blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck | Maiden with Eyes of Blue]] from the deck if it's not drawn in the opening hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Honest**
    *   A valuable card for any Light-Type monster deck, as the majority of [[blue_eyes_white_dragon_deck_composition | Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] cards are Light attribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Dagard**
    *   Allows tributing one monster to change another monster's level to 8, which is excellent for Level 8 Xyz Summoning in this deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Gagaga Magician**
    *   Can declare a level from 1 to 8 once per turn, becoming that level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This provides versatility for Xyz Summoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Lizard Squad is identified as a hacking group that significantly disrupted online gaming services, particularly during the holiday season of 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Who is Lizard Squad?
The speaker characterizes Lizard Squad as potentially "a group of acne ridden 17-year-olds with too much Doritos and Mountain Dew to spare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The group has publicly claimed responsibility for various hacking activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Impact on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network]]
Throughout the weeks leading up to Christmas 2014, both [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live]] and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | PlayStation Network]] experienced consistent outages due to hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Lizard Squad claimed to be behind these "pointless hacks" on both [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | PSN]] and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The group frequently tweeted threats to Sony and Microsoft, promising to take down [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | PSN]] and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_daystation_network | Xbox Live]], and they were successful "almost every time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, Lizard Squad again took down [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | PSN]] and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Alleged [[competitions_between_hacking_groups | Competitions Between Hacking Groups]]
A different group of anonymous hackers, known as "the finest Squad," claimed to have neutralized Lizard Squad approximately a week before the Christmas outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This claim caused confusion when Lizard Squad subsequently managed to take down [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | PSN]] and [[impact_on_xbox_live_and_playstation_network | Xbox Live]] again on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Motives
The speaker suggests that Lizard Squad did not seem to have a specific reason for their attacks, indicating they might have been motivated simply by boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

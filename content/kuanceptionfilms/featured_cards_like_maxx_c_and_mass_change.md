The video, filmed on Saturday, March 19th, captures the excitement of opening the product shortly after its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Premium Gold: Infinite Gold Overview

The Premium Gold: Infinite Gold set is described as looking "very royal" and "really dank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The cards themselves are noted for their gold aesthetic, which is highly appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The product aims to provide "great reprints," including "dank Excis cards," "dank pendulum reprints," "really good Cosmo cards," and "nice [[important_spell_and_trap_cards | trap cards]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The speaker expresses anticipation for pulling specific cards like [[notable_cards_and_their_effects | Mass Change]], Monarch Storm Corp, Gagaga Cowboy, and Cosmo Dark Destroyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

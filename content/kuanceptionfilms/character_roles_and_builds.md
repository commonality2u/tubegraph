This article discusses various [[character_roles_and_abilities | character roles]] and item builds observed during a game, particularly focusing on unconventional picks and their impact.

## Thresh Builds and Role Changes

The player controlling Thresh in this match adopts an unusual "top lane" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. Despite the initial commentary suggesting "Thresh top doesn't do anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, the player transitions to a "Thresh carry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a> with an "AD" (Attack Damage) build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. This [[character_roles_and_abilities | AD Thresh]] build is noted for its effectiveness, with one player exclaiming, "AD Thresh is like ranked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Other Character Roles

*   **Annie Jungle**: The team expresses surprise and skepticism about "Annie jungle" being a viable role, with one player asking, "why is any jungle a thing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Despite this, the Annie character appears to perform well, with commentary noting, "this Annie is going to do some real stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Nasus Top Lane**: Nasus is mentioned as playing in the top lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>, contrasting with the Thresh top.
*   **AD Carry**: The player playing an AD carry character expresses concern about the distribution of kills, noting that the Annie jungle has more kills than them 24 minutes into the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. They describe themselves as "not a greedy AD carry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a> who expects to get kills later in the game due to good CS (creep score) and a weak opposing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Item Progression

A comparison of item progression highlights the game's state:
*   The enemy Jinx character reportedly "doesn't even have an IE [Infinity Edge] yet," only having the components for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   The player's character, presumably the AD carry, already has "three items" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This disparity in item acquisition suggests a significant gold advantage for the player's team, impacting [[player_performance_and_skill_levels | player performance and skill levels]].

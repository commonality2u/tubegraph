When playing [[introduction_to_playing_osu | Osu]], players might aim to achieve impressive performances, particularly on difficult maps like "the big black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While the goal is to demonstrate "amazing o skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> and "beat the song with perfect combo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, the use of auto mode can help achieve this facade.

## Purpose and Secrecy

Auto mode in Osu essentially plays the map for you, allowing for a perfect score and combo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. While it's implied to be a way to impress others by seemingly beating challenging maps, it's advised to keep its usage a secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This allows the player to "impress everybody with your amazing o skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> without revealing the assistance used.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you utilize auto mode, it is suggested to "Don't tell anybody you actually put on auto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

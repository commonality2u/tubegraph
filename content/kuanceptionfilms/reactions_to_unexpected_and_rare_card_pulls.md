Victor, from Quant Ception Films, provides commentary on [[yugioh_card_pulls_and_reactions | Yu-Gi-Oh! card pulls and reactions]] while opening the 2015 Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon Mega Tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. His reactions range from excitement and anticipation to disbelief and shock, particularly when encountering rare and unexpected cards.

## Pre-Opening Anticipation
Having previously opened the Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon Mega Tin and pulled a "frickin Dante" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, which he described as "the dankest lucky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> and "perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, Victor initially doubted if he could top that luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Before diving into the packs, he expressed hopes for specific [[rare_and_super_rare_card_pulls | rare cards]] such as:
*   Another Dante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   Stellar Knight Exies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   Rank fours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   Sational Constructs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Rush it all Winda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>

He also noted cards he *didn't* want, like Clear Force Stealth or Quick Scout, calling them "anti tank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Elder Entity Norden was a primary reason for acquiring this particular tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Initial Card Pulls and Commentary
Upon opening the tin, Victor admired the "beautiful" Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> and the included promo cards, noting the "real nice" appearance of some cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He particularly appreciated the "immense looking" secret rare Jewel Thief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> and the "real beautiful" Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon in the flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. He also highlighted Majesty's Fiend as a "real cool reprint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

He commented on the shift in card rarities, expressing disappointment that "ghost fares and alternate rares" were no longer included in the next pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. As he continued to open packs, he pointed out cards like El Shaddoll Winda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> and Galaxy Tomahawk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, acknowledging their value as "great reprint[s] in the set overall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## The Unbelievable Duplicate Pull
The peak of Victor's reactions occurred when he pulled a second Dante from the 2015 Mega Tin series. His response escalated rapidly:
*   Initial shock: "What the guys guys I think my my packs are trained look at this second doc pick one what the heck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Disbelief and physical reaction: "okay okay what okay okay literally what I can't I I'm shaking right now what the hell is going on oh my gosh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>
*   Realization of incredible luck: "this is a duplicate pack this is oh my gosh guys this is my second Dante in a row second 10 second Dante we're going places in life what this is I can't believe my luck guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>

This [[discussion_of_lucky_pulls_and_repeats | lucky pull]] was so unexpected that he stated, "there's no way we can top that now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:29]</a>. He continued to express amazement, describing the situation as "freakin insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, especially given that the packs were "mega packs inside of a mega ten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, making scaling them for rare cards impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. He concluded by reiterating his "insane" luck: "two tends two dante's my luck is freaking insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

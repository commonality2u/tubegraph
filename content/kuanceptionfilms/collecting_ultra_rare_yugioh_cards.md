Collecting [[value_and_rarity_of_yugioh_cards | rare YuGiOh cards]] involves searching for valuable and unique items, which can include full deck boxes and individual cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These rare items can sometimes be found in unexpected places, such as a Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Unboxing a Rare Deck

A specific rare box was acquired, containing a full Warlock Burst set deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The box itself bore stains, which were seen as adding "character" and indicating its rarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It was humorously claimed to be 200 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### The "Fermenting" Process

To potentially increase the value or rarity of the cards, the box was intentionally left to [[fermenting_yugioh_decks_for_rarity | ferment]] for about two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Initially, this process yielded League of Legends codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. However, the true objective was the [[ultra_rare_and_secret_rare_cards | ultra rare]] YuGiOh cards expected underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Discovering Ultra Rare Cards

The initial opening revealed several highly sought-after cards:
*   **Charizard Ultra Ultra Rare YuGiOh Cards** These cards are considered very rare and difficult to find in stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The cards were described as being in "mint condition" and very shiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Dark Dugtrio** (not considered a valuable pull) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   **Japanese Double Card** A yellow, Raichu-like card, believed to be Japanese and identified as a "double card" with two sides on a single card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This was considered a "legendary" pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Level X Cards and Legendaries** The pack was noted for consistently promising "Level X's and legendaries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Another two-face card was also found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Continued Fermentation and Disappointment

After the initial unboxing, the contents were again left to [[fermenting_yugioh_decks_for_rarity | ferment]] for another two weeks with the hope of generating more valuable cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. A "starter booster pack" featuring tempura paint in five colors (green, blue, red, white, and yellow) was also obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

However, the subsequent results were disappointing, as more "legendaries" like those from the first batch were not found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The collector intended to continue the [[fermenting_yugioh_decks_for_rarity | fermentation]] process for even more value, with the ultimate goal of selling the cards, as they do not play YuGiOh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Unexpected Finds

Further fermentation of the box yielded a "panda bundle" with three rare panda figurines, including a "bumblebee panda" and an "ultra rare" but broken figurine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. These figurines were humorously described as clearing the YuGiOh battle arena and combining with League of Legends RP cards to "win the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Final Outcome

Despite expectations of receiving "the most rare set," the final outcome was deemed a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The cards retrieved were considered worthless, not legendary, and unable to be sold or played <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

One significant challenge when playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 on PC is the relatively small player base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>. The Call of Duty franchise originated on PC in 2003, with players being active on the platform since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. However, Activision's marketing has largely succeeded in targeting a younger, console-based audience, leading to a predominantly console community for Black Ops 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:07">[02:13:07]</a>. This neglect of the PC consumer base is noted as irritating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:09">[02:23:09]</a>.

## Matchmaking and Available Playlists

The small player base on PC results in significant in-game playlist issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:47">[01:56:47]</a>. It is often difficult to find enough players to start matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>. Players can generally only find games in Team Deathmatch and Chaos Mosh Pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>. On a good day, it might be possible to find a Free-For-All or Gun Game lobby, but these are rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a>.

## Characteristics of the PC Player Base

Despite the smaller size, the PC player base for Black Ops 3 is generally more competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Most players have at least some experience with first-person shooter games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Additionally, there are fewer "small obnoxious children" on PC Black Ops 3, which is considered a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

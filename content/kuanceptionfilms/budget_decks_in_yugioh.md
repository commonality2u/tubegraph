> This specific deck was built for just under $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The creator pieced it together by buying a couple of packs of Premium Gold and using existing cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

### Monsters

The monster line-up focuses on synergizing with [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | trap card]]s and maintaining field presence.

*   **[[yu_gi_oh_traptrix_deck_strategy | Trap Tricks]] Myrmeleo (x2)**: Essential for the deck. When summoned, it allows the player to add a "Hole" [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | trap card]] to their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. When special summoned, it can destroy an opponent's spell or [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | trap card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   **[[yu_gi_oh_traptrix_deck_strategy | Trap Tricks]] Dionaea (x2)**: Can special summon [[yu_gi_oh_traptrix_deck_strategy | Trap Tricks]] monsters from the graveyard when normal summoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. When special summoned, it retrieves a "Hole" [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | trap card]] from the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **[[yu_gi_oh_traptrix_deck_strategy | Trap Tricks]] Trap Nepenthes (x2)**: Features high defense and a good effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **[[yu_gi_oh_traptrix_deck_strategy | Trap Tricks]] Atrax (x1)**: Has high attack and a useful effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo (x1)**: A crucial card that prevents either player from special summoning monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. If flipped face-up, it destroys all special summoned monsters on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Gravekeeper's Spy (x2)**: Considered the best Level 4 Gravekeeper for this deck. When flipped face-up, it special summons another Gravekeeper's monster with 1500 or less ATK from the deck, enabling easy [[building_rank_four_decks | Rank 4 Xyz]] plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Summoner Monk (x1)**: Useful for getting out Level 4 monsters for [[building_rank_four_decks | Rank 4 Xyz]] summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Kagetokage (x1)**: Can be special summoned from the hand when a Level 4 monster is normal summoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Malefic Stardust Dragon (x1)**: Included for extra attack power and its ability to be special summoned by banishing a Stardust Dragon from the Extra Deck, thus not taking up main deck space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Santa Claws (x1)**: A strong removal card to tribute opponent's high-power monsters like Quasar or Cyber Dragon Infinity, as its tribute summon cannot be negated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

### Spells

The spell cards provide field control, search capabilities, and stall tactics.

*   **Black Garden (x1)**: A "trolly" field spell that halves the ATK of newly summoned monsters and allows the opposing player to special summon an 800 ATK/DEF token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This can lead to building a "token army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **Necrovalley (x2)**: Essential for the deck, boosting Gravekeeper's Spy's ATK/DEF and preventing opponents from special summoning monsters from the graveyard, shutting down many decks like Shaddoll and Stellarknight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Terraforming (x2)**: Provides draw power to ensure access to field cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Dark Hole (x1)**: A destruction card useful for clearing the field, especially when certain monsters have effects that activate upon being sent to the graveyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   **Swords of Revealing Light (x2)**: Excellent for stalling time in this lockdown/troll deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Preferred over Gravity Bind due to the prevalence of [[building_rank_four_decks | Rank 4 Xyz]] monsters which are unaffected by Gravity Bind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Burden of the Mighty (x1)**: A "trolling" card that reduces each face-up monster's ATK by 100 times its own level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **Mystical Space Typhoon (x1)**: For essential spell/[[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | trap card]] removal, especially continuous spells/traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### Traps

The deck heavily relies on [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | trap card]]s for its lockdown, burn, and control strategy.

*   **Bottomless Trap Hole (x1)**: Critical for removing strong special summoned monsters from play. Easily searched by [[yu_gi_oh_traptrix_deck_strategy | Trap Tricks]] cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   **Trap Hole (x2)**: Effective when Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo is on the field, forcing opponents to normal summon and allowing Trap Hole to remove those monsters, leading to a lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   **[[yu_gi_oh_traptrix_deck_strategy | Trap Tricks]] Trap Hole Nightmare (x1)**: Negates and destroys the effects of monsters special summoned during the turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Dark Trap Hole (x1)**: Banishes Level 5 or higher effect monsters that are special summoned, serving as a backup to Bottomless Trap Hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
*   **Solemn Warning (x1)**: A "trolly" and essential card that negates any monster summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
*   **Nightmare Wheel (x2)**: Prevents an opponent's monster from attacking and inflicts 500 damage during each standby phase, contributing to the burn strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   **Coffin Seller (x1)**: Inflicts 300 damage to the opponent each time a monster is sent to their graveyard, providing additional burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   **Mirror Force (x1)**: For obvious defensive reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
*   **Scrap-Iron Scarecrow (x1)**: A "trolly" defensive card that resets itself face-down instead of going to the graveyard, offering continuous defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.
*   **Magic Cylinder (x1)**: For extra defensive power and significant burn damage against high ATK monsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.
*   **Wall of Disruption (x1)**: An impactful alternative to Mirror Force. When an opponent's monster declares an attack, all their attack position monsters lose 800 ATK for each monster they control, potentially inflicting massive ATK reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.
*   **Compulsory Evacuation Device (x1)**: An essential [[trap_card_strategies_in_yugioh | trap card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Ceasefire (x2)**: Provides significant burn damage. If two are activated with multiple monsters on both sides of the field, it can deal 6000 life points of damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

### Extra Deck

The Extra Deck is primarily composed of flexible [[building_rank_four_decks | Rank 4 Xyz]] monsters, with a couple of essential picks.

*   **Leviair the Sea Dragon (x1)**: Though not explicitly mentioned as essential, it's a common rank 3 Xyz used for recovering banished monsters. (The speaker mentions "Levl-Volva chain" as essential for getting Fossil Dyna on top of the deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>, which implies Lev-Volva as a key card.)
*   **Number 101: Silent Honor ARK (x1)**: Considered "really broken" and a great defensive [[building_rank_four_decks | Rank 4 Xyz]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
*   **Number 50: Blackship of Corn (x1)**: Deals 1000 damage each turn if the opponent has a monster with less ATK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **Number 55: Gogogo Goliath (x1)**: A temporary [[building_rank_four_decks | Rank 4 Xyz]] with a good effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
*   **Number 39: Utopia (x1)**: An essential [[building_rank_four_decks | Rank 4 Xyz]] for any deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.
*   **Stardust Dragon (x1)**: Included solely to allow the summon of Malefic Stardust Dragon from the main deck, as the deck does not use tuners for its own summon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

The Extra Deck is generally flexible, allowing players to run any [[building_rank_four_decks | Rank 4 Xyz]] monsters they prefer, but Levolval Chain and Number 101: Silent Honor ARK are considered essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. The creator plans to add Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon once its reprint becomes available and more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

## Building Budget Decks

This specific budget deck was assembled for under $30 by purchasing a couple of packs of Premium Gold and incorporating cards found "lying around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This approach highlights that competitive decks can be built without extensive investment, often by creatively combining available resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

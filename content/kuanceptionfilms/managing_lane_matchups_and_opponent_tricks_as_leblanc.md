Playing LeBlanc effectively in lane involves understanding opponent behaviors, strategic positioning, and maximizing early game pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Early Game Strategy
To make "MLG plays," consider hiding in the top bush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. LeBlanc's abilities can easily reduce an enemy's health by half at level one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It's suggested that opponents like [[league_of_legends_gameplay_strategy | Echo]] cannot trade effectively at level one, making [[strategy_for_early_game_with_leblanc | LeBlanc]] a strong early game champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Upon hitting level three, you can "all in" your enemy for a kill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Opponent Tricks
It is possible to trick enemies into placing wards in ineffective locations, such as at their Krugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Interaction with Junglers
One unconventional approach is to "take care of your jungler" by standing next to the opposing team's buff at the start of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This can make LeBlanc "OP as hell" even without abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. When taking your own jungler's blue buff, do so quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. If an opposing jungler attempts to gank your lane, you might consider ignoring them to secure the kill for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Item Build
For an initial purchase, acquire a "hexagonal nut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. On your first back, aim to get a "spooky mask" and a "star root wand." These items are said to provide true damage that scales with your current gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Gameplay Mechanics
*   Always utilize LeBlanc's W ability to return to your previous position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   If you die in lane, attribute it to "custom Minion" damage rather than the enemy champion, as "you are never the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   It's suggested to miss every minion to build motivation for future kills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   When the enemy attempts to take Dragon, make sure to steal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   Mid-turret can be destroyed from 100% health with LeBlanc's "OP auto attacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Outcomes
The overall strategy, even with potential "feeding," is said to result in deserving "Challenger" rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

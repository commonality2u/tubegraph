[[square_enix_final_fantasy_remakes_history | Square Enix]] has a long history of remaking its classic NES and SNES Final Fantasy titles for various handheld platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Many of these remakes, released on the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and PSP, have been well-received and commercially successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Game Boy Advance (GBA) Remakes

The Game Boy Advance saw the release of several Final Fantasy remakes, including:
*   Final Fantasy I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Final Fantasy II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Final Fantasy IV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Final Fantasy V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Final Fantasy VI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

While [[square_enix_final_fantasy_remakes_history | Square Enix]] did a "decent job" porting these titles to the GBA, these versions were not complete redesigns of the original games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Nintendo DS (NDS) Remakes

The Nintendo DS, however, received more ambitious remakes:
*   Final Fantasy III <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   Final Fantasy IV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

These NDS remakes were "killer" and presented as "wonderfully animated 3D versions" of the original games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Final Fantasy III is often considered an underrated and neglected title, while Final Fantasy IV is widely praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Potential for New 3D Handheld Remakes

Considering the quality of the 3D remakes on the DS, there is significant [[ps_vita_and_3d_handheld_gaming_potential | potential]] for new Final Fantasy titles on current handhelds like the Nintendo 3DS and [[ps_vita_and_3d_handheld_gaming_potential | PS Vita]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Many fans would appreciate seeing 3D versions of games like:
*   **Final Fantasy VI**: Praised for having one of the best plots and soundtracks among all Final Fantasy games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. A 3D remake of Final Fantasy VI would be "awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Final Fantasy V**: Another underrated title known for its "wonderful class-based character system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The prospect of [[potential_for_3d_remakes_of_final_fantasy_v_and_vi | 3D remakes of Final Fantasy V and VI]] for both the 3DS and [[ps_vita_and_3d_handheld_gaming_potential | PS Vita]] is highly anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Existing Remasters on PS Vita

The [[ps_vita_and_3d_handheld_gaming_potential | PS Vita]] already features an HD remaster of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

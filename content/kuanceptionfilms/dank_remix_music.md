"Dank remix music" refers to a style of musical parody or meme, often characterized by its unconventional or intentionally low-quality production, incorporating internet culture references and [[sound_effects_in_music | sound effects]]. It aims to evoke a humorous or absurd response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Characteristics

This genre frequently includes:
*   **Visual Memes** Such as icons depicting "weed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, or the "Pepe" frog character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. In the context of a game, these might appear as custom "skins" for in-game elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. An example is a "Twitch Chat" skin where every circle is Pepe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Referential [[sound_effects_in_music | Sound Effects]]** Parodies often integrate sound clips or elements from other internet phenomena, such as the "gift of dancing kid" used for skip buttons in a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Deliberate Distortion** The audio may be intentionally distorted or modified in a way that is perceived as "not how it works," adding to its bizarre or humorous effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Notable Example

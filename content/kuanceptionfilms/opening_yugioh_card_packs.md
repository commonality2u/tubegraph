The act of [[yugioh_pack_opening_experience | opening Yugioh card packs]] often involves anticipation of [[pulling_rare_yugioh_cards | rare Yugioh card pulls]] and useful additions for deck building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Featured Product
A specific product blister pack was opened, which included:
*   40 card sleeves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   One booster pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Two foil [[promotional_yugioh_cards | promo cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

This particular blister pack was purchased from Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Pack Contents
Upon opening the blister, the contents were revealed:
*   **Booster Pack**: A "Judgment of the Light" booster pack was included, noted to be scrunched up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Promo Cards**: Two foil cards were included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. One of them was already known to be "Dark Hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, while the other was a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## The Opening Process
The booster pack was opened in a particular style, referred to as "the Dank way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, intended to bring good luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Cards Pulled
After the [[yugioh_pack_opening_experience | pack opening]], the following cards were revealed:

*   **From the Booster Pack**: A "Mecha Phantom Beast" rare card was pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **From the Promo Cards**:
    *   Dark Hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
    *   Instant Fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

The "Instant Fusion" card was highlighted as one of the best [[promotional_yugioh_cards | promo cards]] that could have been pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, particularly useful for building rank four decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> and beneficial with "Nordon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

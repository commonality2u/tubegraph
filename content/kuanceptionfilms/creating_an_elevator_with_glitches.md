This glitch can be a part of [[using_glitches_as_a_survival_strategy_in_minecraft_pe | survival strategies]] during [[gameplay sequences | gameplay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Materials Needed

To perform this glitch, you will need:
*   A wooden door or a trap door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   Building materials such as cobblestone or wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>

## Constructing the Tower

First, you must build a tower using your chosen building materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The tower should be exactly straight with a pole going straight down the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Performing the Door Glitch

This glitch is also known as the [[building_a_tower_with_a_door_glitch | building a tower with a door glitch]]. Follow these steps to execute it:

1.  **Place the Door:** Position a wooden door or trap door directly underneath the tower you have built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
2.  **Get Trapped:** Walk up to the door and close it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. If done correctly, you should become stuck inside the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
3.  **Exit the Game:** While stuck, close out of the Minecraft Pocket Edition game application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
4.  **Re-enter the Game:** Open the app again, press play, and re-enter your game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Upon re-entering the game, you should find yourself instantly on top of the tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Practical Applications

This glitch offers several practical applications within the game:
*   **Improvised Elevator:** It can be used to create an elevator effect, allowing quick ascension to the top of structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Survival Fortification:** If you are being attacked by zombies and do not have a bed, you can quickly build a small structure, place a door, and use this glitch to teleport to the top, creating a temporary fortress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This provides a quick defensive position against threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

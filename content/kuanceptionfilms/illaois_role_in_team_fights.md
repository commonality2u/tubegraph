As part of the [[League of Legends gameplay]] demonstration for Illaoi, the video concludes with a "customary big-ass... team fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> to showcase her in action during a larger engagement. While the specific details of [[Illaoi champion abilities | Illaoi's abilities]] are mentioned earlier—such as her Q, "Tentacle Smash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, E, "Test of Spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, and ultimate, "Leap of Faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>—the transcript does not detail her specific role or [[ingame_strategies_and_tactics | strategies]] within the presented team fight. The focus shifts to the general "gameplay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> demonstration.

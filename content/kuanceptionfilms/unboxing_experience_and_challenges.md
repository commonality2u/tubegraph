Victor of Conception Films presents an [[Unboxing experience and product review | unboxing]] of a Primal Origin Korean OCG booster box [00:00:30]. This booster box was a gift from Min Soo Kim [00:00:42].

## Initial Unboxing and Setup

The host expressed hope for pulling specific cards like Bujin cards or Galaxy-Eyes Photon cards [00:01:22]. The unboxing began with a "pretty smashed" box, indicating it might have been tossed around [00:01:46].

### Opening Challenges
Opening the booster box proved difficult, described as "too strong for us" [00:01:31]. It took approximately 20 minutes to open the booster box itself [00:02:00]. After opening, the host initially thought there were 24 packs, but it was later determined to contain 40 booster packs [00:02:12], a realization that took about seven minutes to figure out [00:02:23].

## Pack Opening and Notable Pulls

Throughout the opening, the host hoped to pull super rare or artifact cards [00:03:39].

### Early Pulls
The first super rare pulled was Chaos Number 103 [00:04:42]. Other early pulls included various rare cards, a field card, and a "trap tricks dynein" [00:03:03].

### Pack Ripping Theory
A "pack ripping theory" was discussed, suggesting that the way a pack is ripped affects the cards pulled [00:05:48]. This theory was tested by cutting a pack down the middle, which seemingly resulted in pulling a secret rare [00:05:52]. However, later attempts suggested "theories crap continues" [00:06:13].

### Mid-Unboxing Discoveries
*   A prismatic rare Artifact Xyz card was pulled [00:08:05].
*   An "Elder God Noden" was pulled, which the host considered a "really good rare" [00:09:21]. This card was noted to not be available in the English version of Primal Origins [00:09:44].
*   A "double pack" was found, meaning a pack with no rares or hollows [00:10:41].

### Later Challenges and Pulls
As the [[Unboxing and Review | unboxing]] continued, the pace had to be sped up due to time [00:07:06]. Some packs yielded "nothing good" or only common cards [00:13:30].

A significant pull was the Tellarknight "prime photon" (Tellarknight Ptolemaeus), described as very nice and an "ultimate" rare [00:12:53].

### Final Pack Strategy
For the final pack, the host emphasized a "very unique way" of opening it to find the "best card in the set," humorously stating it was Ojama Yellow [00:15:56]. This pack was opened by cutting it down the middle [00:16:03].

## Recap of Pulled Cards
The [[Unboxing experience and product review | unboxing]] yielded several notable cards:
*   Four super rares [00:16:47].
*   A Bujin card [00:16:50].
*   "Phone on posts" [00:16:50].
*   Two Xyz cards [00:16:54].
*   Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon [00:16:56].

A Prismatic rare Artifact Xyz card was pulled, generating excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The individual noted that they had never familiarized themselves with the Artifact card type and therefore did not know its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

This pull occurred during a session that also included other notable [[yugioh_card_pulls_and_reactions | Yu-Gi-Oh! card pulls]] and [[reactions_to_unexpected_and_rare_card_pulls | reactions]], such as a Dark Magician Girl OCG foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> and a Mass Hero Acid, which was the specific card the individual was hoping for and the reason for purchasing the tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Additional [[rare_and_super_rare_card_pulls | rare card pulls]] included:
*   A "Sword Spin of Revealing" card, described as looking "really really cool" and a card the individual had never pulled before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   A [[ultra_rare_and_secret_rare_cards | Secret Rare]] Bottomless Trap Hole, which caused significant excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Another [[ultra_rare_and_secret_rare_cards | Secret Rare]] Bottomless Trap Hole was pulled later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Despite the excitement for some [[lucky_pulls_and_rare_cards_in_2015_mega_tin | lucky pulls]], some cards were identified as "bad" or "ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The PC version of the *Black Ops 3* beta suffered from significant [[performance_and_optimization_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | performance and optimization issues]] at the time of its release [00:00:47]. The game ran "terribly" even on systems with graphics cards like the Nvidia GeForce GTX 750 Ti, which was considered a "pretty all right" and "not outdated" card [00:00:53]. These [[optimization_problems_in_black_ops_3 | optimization problems]] made the PC experience less enjoyable compared to the console beta [00:02:20].

## General Performance Concerns

The game "doesn't feel very optimized" for PC [00:01:18]. Despite using Fraps for recording, which usually maintains a consistent frame rate, the *Black Ops 3* beta exhibited "huge drops" in frame rate [00:01:07]. The overall impression was that the game was "not looking ideal" and "not looking very good" on PC [00:01:54].

### Historical Context of Call of Duty PC Optimization

Historically, *Call of Duty* games were once exclusive to PC [00:01:23]. However, recent titles in the franchise have been disappointing in terms of their PC optimization [00:01:28]. While *Modern Warfare 3* and *Black Ops 2* felt "all right" on PC, *Black Ops 1* and *Ghosts* were described as having "complete garbage" optimization for the platform [00:01:34]. The issues in the *Black Ops 3* beta seemed to continue this trend [00:01:49].

## Game-Breaking Issues

Beyond general performance, the *Black Ops 3* beta on PC was plagued by severe [[black_ops_3_beta_lag_and_server_issues | game-breaking lag]] [00:03:48]. This made the game difficult to play and highlighted that [[pc_gaming_optimization_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC players]] "have it hard" [00:04:25].

Additionally, some users experienced issues where the game would not even launch or connect to servers [00:04:57]. One instance involved a friend who downloaded the beta but "didn't get the right version somehow," preventing the game from working at all [00:04:43].

## Comparison to Console Performance

The experience on the PC beta was notably different from the console beta. The PlayStation 4 beta, for example, was described as "amazing," providing "great fun" even for someone not accustomed to playing on a PlayStation 4 [00:02:20]. This stark contrast suggested that *Black Ops 3* was "really fun on the consoles" but presented challenges for [[pros_and_cons_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | PC players]] without high-end machines [00:05:14].

## Hope for the Full Release

Despite the beta's shortcomings, there was hope that the full release of *Black Ops 3* would address these [[optimization_problems_in_black_ops_3 | optimization problems]] [00:02:07]. It was expressed that Treyarch, the developer, needed to "optimize the game for PC" to ensure a polished experience for the general public [00:02:17]. If the final game on PC did not resolve these issues, players were warned to expect lag and frustration [00:05:19].

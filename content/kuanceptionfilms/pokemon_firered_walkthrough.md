This article provides a commentary-style walkthrough of the initial stages of *Pokemon FireRed*, covering character selection, interactions with Professor Oak, and the first rival battle.

## Getting Started: Character and Name Selection

The player begins their journey by choosing their character's gender, opting to be a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The player then names their character "69" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Interactions with Professor Oak

The journey starts with the iconic [[professor_oaks_introduction_and_pokemon_selection | Professor Oak]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, who introduces the world inhabited by creatures called Pokémon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The speaker questions if "Pokémon" actually means "animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

[[professor_oaks_introduction_and_pokemon_selection | Professor Oak]] explains that Pokémon live in Tall Grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> and suggests obtaining a Pokémon for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The speaker sarcastically refers to the Pokémon as "slaves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> and expresses reluctance to take one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Starter Pokémon Selection

The player is presented with the choice of starter Pokémon. The speaker notes they have "already used all of them except for Squirtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, leading them to choose Squirtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Following their earlier commentary, the player names their new Squirtle "slave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## First Rival Battle

Shortly after selecting their starter, the player's rival (also named "69" by the player) takes the other remaining Pokémon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> and immediately challenges the player to a battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The speaker expresses surprise and questions the rival's aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

The battle is described as a "Turtle against a rat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The speaker recalls their [[first_pokemon_battle_and_strategies | first Pokemon battle]] experience with the game, remarking that they initially found it "impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. After the battle, the rival departs, stating "smell you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The player then resolves to "go train my Pokemon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Gameplay Observations

*   **Game Speed**: The speaker notes the game's initial slowness and utilizes a "speed" option to accelerate gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Dialogue**: The speaker often dismisses in-game dialogue, particularly from [[professor_oaks_introduction_and_pokemon_selection | Professor Oak]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> and comments about "technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> and "PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Item Acquisition**: The speaker humorously attempts to "grab a potion" directly from the computer screen, noting it would be "realistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Familiarity**: The speaker states they have "played this before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, indicating prior experience with the game.

In the rhythm game Osu!, player performance is measured through a combination of ranking systems and individual song scores. These systems dictate a player's standing and indicate their proficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Performance Points (PP) and Global Rank

A player's global rank in Osu! is determined by their accumulated Performance Points (PP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The relationship between PP and rank can change over time due to the growing player base; for example, a player with 1,000 PP who was once ranked around 70,000th might later find themselves ranked 113,000th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. A lower rank number signifies a better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Players discuss the semantics of rank changes, with "going up in rank" meaning moving towards rank #1, like climbing a ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Conversely, "minus" or "falling down" in rank means moving to a higher (worse) numerical rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Score Calculation

Individual scores on songs are influenced by various factors displayed "under our names" during gameplay, including multipliers and accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Achieving a high accuracy is crucial for a good score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Specific examples of score components and performance include:
*   A "high accuracy" is noted during gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   One player's accuracy is observed at 83%, while another's is 84%, and a third's is 92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   The discussion mentions reaching scores "over 1 million points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   A player mentions their rank as "39k" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Gameplay involves hitting [[osu_game_mechanics_and_strategies | jumps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> and avoiding misses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, which directly impacts accuracy and score.

## Game Performance Anomalies

Players sometimes experience issues that affect their ability to score, such as lagging visuals that prevent them from seeing score-related information or jumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

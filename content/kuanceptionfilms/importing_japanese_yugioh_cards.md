While not yet available in the United States, the [[yugioh_synchron_extreme_japanese_structure_deck | Synchron Extreme Japanese Structure Deck]] is currently available for purchase in Japan and Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Sourcing Japanese Cards
The [[yugioh_synchron_extreme_japanese_structure_deck | Synchron Extreme Japanese Structure Deck]] can be purchased on Amazon for approximately twenty dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. If you do not have Amazon Prime, the deck ships from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. However, with Amazon Prime, it ships in two days from a US-based facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The unboxer plans to acquire more Japanese cards in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Differences in Japanese Structure Decks
[[japanese_vs_english_yugioh_decks | Japanese Yugioh structure decks]] are packaged differently than their English counterparts, coming in plastic holders instead of the regular packaging that holds the entire deck together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The cards themselves are noted to "feel really good in the hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Understanding Japanese Cards
Since the cards are in Japanese, understanding their effects requires external resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A link with all the cards from the Synchron Extreme deck, including their English effects and names, will be provided for reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Minecraft Pocket Edition (PE) on iOS offers several glitches that can be exploited to gain an advantage in gameplay, effectively serving as survival strategies or shortcuts for resource acquisition and evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## [[cloning_glitch_in_minecraft_pe | Cloning Glitch]]

This [[cloning_glitch_in_minecraft_pe | cloning glitch]] allows players to duplicate items, providing an [[infinite_diamond_and_gold_glitch | infinite diamond and gold glitch]] and other valuable resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### How to Perform the Cloning Glitch

> [00:00:28] "what you got to do is have your items in your items pockets of course make sure you have an empty chest and you want to open it up here put everything inside okay and then you exit out of your game log back in get back your stuff now the next part is important once you exit out of your chest you're going to have to walk around for a good 20 or 30 seconds without breaking or changing anything so yeah just walk around for a good 20 30 seconds I would even walk for a good minute or I would just be safe and once you've walked for a while Tak out of your game you want to end it on your multitasking bar that you want to go back and open the app again press play go back to your game VOA just like that you have cloned your items"

1.  **Preparation**: Ensure you have the items you wish to clone in your inventory and an empty chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  **Deposit Items**: Open the empty chest and place all desired items inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
3.  **First Exit & Re-entry**: Exit the game, then log back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Retrieve your items from the chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
4.  **Walk Around**: After exiting the chest, walk around for approximately 20-30 seconds (or even a full minute to be safe) without breaking or changing any blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
5.  **Second Exit & App Termination**: Exit the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Crucially, end the app completely from your device's multitasking bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
6.  **Final Re-entry**: Re-open the Minecraft PE app, press play, and return to your game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Your items should now be duplicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Survival Applications

This [[infinite_diamond_and_gold_glitch | infinite diamond and gold glitch]] is highly effective for obtaining unlimited quantities of valuable items like diamond or gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. With sufficient gold and diamond, players can construct a nether reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## [[building_a_tower_with_a_door_glitch | Building a Tower with a Door Glitch]] (Elevator/Fortress Glitch)

This glitch allows players to instantly teleport to the top of a constructed tower using a door, effectively [[creating_an_elevator_with_glitches | creating an elevator with glitches]] or a quick escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

2.  **Build Tower**: Construct a tall, straight tower with a clear central pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
3.  **Place Door**: Position a door directly underneath the tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
4.  **Enter Door**: Walk up to the door and close it, trapping yourself inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
5.  **Exit Game & Re-enter**: Close out of the game, then go back inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. You should reappear on top of the tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

*   **Escape from Zombies**: If under attack by zombies, quickly building a tower and performing this glitch provides a rapid escape to a safe, elevated position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Makeshift Fortress**: If you lack a bed, this glitch allows you to build a door, place it down, and instantly teleport to the top of a self-made fortress, offering a temporary safe haven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

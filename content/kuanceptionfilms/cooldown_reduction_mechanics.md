A champion's 'W' ability can have its cooldown significantly reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. With 45% cooldown reduction (CDR), this ability's cooldown can be as low as three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This allows for repeated use of the 'W' ability after jumping onto an opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

Victor of Conception Films highlights significant weapon balance issues within the [[issues_with_player_base_on_pc_black_ops_3 | PC community]] of Call of Duty: [[challenges_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | Black Ops 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This problem is described as "getting out of hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Overuse of Specific Weapons

On [[pros_and_cons_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | PC]], players predominantly use the Drakon and P-06 sniper rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It's common to find that three-fourths of players in any given lobby are "spamming" these weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While sniper rifles can be satisfying and good for Call of Duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, their widespread use on [[challenges_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | PC]] indicates a clear weapon balance problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The Brecci shotgun is also noted as being overused, contributing to a "mess of sniper rifles and shotguns" on [[pros_and_cons_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | PC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Comparison with Console Weapon Balance

Weapon balance on console is generally considered "on point" and effective, for which Treyarch is commended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Most console players believe sniper rifles are balanced and not an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. However, this differs significantly on [[challenges_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | PC]], where snipers are "overpopulating" and "oversaturating the game with spam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Root Cause

The reason these weapons are problematic on [[pros_and_cons_of_black_ops_3_on_pc | PC]] is because they were [[differences_between_pc_and_console_weapon_optimization | optimized for console player usage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The game's developers are perceived to be promoting certain weapons by giving them better stats, leading to an imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Impact on Player Experience

The lack of weapon variety diminishes the fun for players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Players desire variety and a diverse gameplay experience, not knowing what to expect from every game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Constantly being shot from every angle by P-06s and Drakons leads to a monotonous experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Players want to play "Call of Duty: Black Ops 3," not "Call of Duty: Drakon" or "Call of Duty: P-06" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Proposed Solution

There is a strong call for Treyarch to implement [[need_for_dedicated_weapon_balancing_for_pc | dedicated weapon balancing]] specifically for the [[challenges_of_playing_black_ops_3_on_pc | PC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This would involve having [[optimization_challenges_for_black_ops_3_on_pc | dedicated weapon stats]] tailored for the [[issues_with_player_base_on_pc_black_ops_3 | PC community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This concept is described as simple and should not be difficult for developers to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The provided transcript does not contain any information about cards being unbanned or their potential impact on Yu-Gi-Oh! gameplay. Instead, it focuses on cards that were banned or otherwise affected by a new banlist.

The speaker expresses disappointment that "Shaddoll" cards were *not* freed or unbanned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This indicates that as of the July 16, 2015 [[yugioh_banlist_review_and_changes | banlist]], no significant cards were unbanned to impact gameplay in the way the speaker desired.

The discussion primarily revolves around:
*   The new [[yugioh_banlist_review_and_changes | Forbidden/Unlimited list]] effective July 16, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   [[yugioh_banlist_review_and_changes | Nerfs]] to the Nekroz archetype, specifically the banning of Genex Ally Birdman (mispronounced as "Gin releaser of rituals") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The speaker questioned this decision, suggesting that core Nekroz cards should have been targeted instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   The banning of Traptrix Myrmeleo (mispronounced as "Baofeng chain") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This was seen as a [[yugioh_banlist_review_and_changes | hit]] to Tellarknights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a> and a preemptive measure by Konami to promote new cards like "Oden" (likely referring to the release of new archetypes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   Frustration that Qliphorts and Burning Abyss archetypes were not impacted by the [[yugioh_banlist_review_and_changes | banlist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. The speaker specifically hoped for "Lose One Turn" to be limited due to its "cancerous" effect in competitive Yu-Gi-Oh! <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

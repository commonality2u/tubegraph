Treyarch faces a significant [[weapon_balance_problems_on_pc_vs_console | weapon balance problem]] within the [[pc_community_issues_in_black_ops_3 | PC community of Black Ops 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Unlike on consoles where weapon balance is considered effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, the PC version is plagued by an over-reliance on specific weapons.

## Overpopulation of Specific Weapons on PC

A major issue on PC is that nearly every player uses the Drakon and P-06 sniper rifles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It's common to find that three-fourths of players in any given lobby are spamming these two weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While sniper rifles can be satisfying and beneficial in a Call of Duty game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, their widespread use on PC highlights a weapon balance issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

In addition to sniper rifles, shotguns like the Brecci are also contributing to an overpopulation of specific weapon types, oversaturating the game with spam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This lack of weapon variety diminishes the fun for players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, who desire different gameplay experiences rather than consistently facing the same weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Comparison to Console Performance

On console, weapon balance is generally considered "on point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, with many players believing sniper rifles are balanced and not problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the PC experience, where these weapons lead to a "mess of sniper rifles and shotguns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The Need for PC-Specific Optimization

The core of the problem is that these weapons are problematic on PC because they were optimized for console player usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This means their stats and behavior, while balanced for a console environment, create an imbalance on the PC platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

To address this, it is suggested that Treyarch implement [[pc_gaming_optimization_issues_in_black_ops_3 | dedicated weapon balancing]] specifically for the PC community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This would involve creating unique weapon stats tailored for PC gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, ensuring a more varied and enjoyable experience for all players.

The iPhone can be used for broadcast-quality audio recording on the move by connecting an XLR microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This capability was demonstrated with an iPhone 3G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Essential Cable
To connect an XLR microphone to an iPhone, a specific [[iPhone to XLR cable solutions | custom cable]] is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This cable is an XLR to a "very custom special three stripe connector" that plugs into the iPhone's audio jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Such [[custom_cables_for_audio_devices | custom cables]] can be sourced from specialized providers like yourcustomcable.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Connection Order

## Microphone Compatibility
[[iPhone compatibility with microphones | Not all XLR microphones]] will work directly with this setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For successful recording, the XLR microphone must be either:
*   A dynamic microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   A [[using_powered_microphones_with_iphones | powered microphone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

Powered microphones typically contain an internal 1.5-volt AA battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

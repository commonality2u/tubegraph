The Avalon blockchain is a proprietary blockchain designed by the DTube team, which integrates with the Steam blockchain to support decentralized video content [00:02:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. It operates alongside DTube's decentralized platform, which runs on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for video storage [00:01:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## What is Avalon?

Avalon is DTube's own blockchain, developed to complement the Steam blockchain's functionality [00:02:23]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It was created to manage specific aspects of the DTube platform, such as its voting and commenting system, while still leveraging the existing upvoting mechanisms of Steam [00:02:25]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Users have an account on Avalon in addition to their Steam account when interacting with DTube [00:02:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

As of the transcript, Avalon is operating as a public test net [00:03:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, meaning that any tokens earned on the Avalon chain may be lost during a chain reset [00:04:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Despite this, [[uploading_videos_on_dtube_using_a_decentralized_platform | posting videos on Avalon]] is a prerequisite for DTube curation [00:05:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. DTube is also launching its own coin, DTC, around May [00:02:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The DTube team demonstrated a "mad respect" for users by initially running both Steam and Avalon chains in parallel during the crossover, making the transition easy for users [00:06:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The speaker is an Avalon leader server, ranked approximately 27th [00:03:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## DTube's Use of Avalon

DTube, a decentralized platform similar to YouTube in styling [00:01:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, leverages Avalon for its core operations while maintaining a connection to the Steam blockchain.

*   **Account Management** Users log in to DTube with their Steam account (e.g., using Steam Keychain) [00:01:15]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. However, DTube also requires an Avalon account, and users may need to log in with their Avalon blockchain password [00:02:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Content Curation** For a video to be eligible for DTube curation, it must be posted on Avalon [00:05:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Community Presence** DTube is a significant community on Steam, being the second largest at the time of the transcript and expected to become the largest [00:09:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The DTube posters form the biggest community on SteamIt [00:09:49]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Key Features and Considerations

*   **Decentralized Hosting** DTube's backend for video storage uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), an open-source codebase [00:01:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. DTube maintains its own hosting and servers for this [00:02:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Video Uploading** Users can upload video files (e.g., MP4) directly via the DTube interface or through third-party services like One Love IPFS [00:03:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   One Love IPFS is a separate group that offers [[benefits_and_setup_of_decentralized_video_hosting_with_ipfs | IPFS hosting]] from $3 a month, providing 16GB of data storage on two separate nodes, access to their uploader, 24/7 live support, and access to a paid Discord IPFS bot for content posting to DTube and DSound [00:03:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Video Quality** Unlike platforms like YouTube that automatically convert videos to different data rates, DTube (as a newer system) requires users to upload user-encoded versions for different qualities (e.g., 240p, 480p, 720p, 1080p) [00:07:40]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This allows users on low internet connections or limited cellular data to watch videos at a suitable quality [00:08:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Handbrake is a free tool recommended for converting video files [00:07:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Content Interaction** Users can add a title, description, and tags to their videos, and set an Avalon vote percentage (e.g., 10%) [00:08:36]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. When uploaded, a graphic thumbnail is posted to the Steam blockchain, which then links to the DTube video [00:08:45]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Other Platforms** DTube is presented as an alternative for YouTubers who have experienced content strikes and are looking for alternative hosting [00:04:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Other decentralized platforms like LBRY and Skynet are also mentioned [00:04:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Future Outlook** There's an anticipation of more video content on the Steam blockchain, potentially driven by [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | Tron's acquisition of BitTorrent]] technology, leading to new video-based portals with textual conversations [00:09:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

The Nokia N95 experienced [[recording_bugs_with_the_n95 | recording bugs]] that could lead to [[user_interface_problems_during_recording | user interface freezes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These freezes occurred particularly when recording video clips in succession and the device prompted the user to save to the web without the user being able to see or respond to the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Bug Description

A significant bug was identified where, after stopping a video recording, the N95 would prompt the user to send the clip to a destination, such as integrated services like Shu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. If multiple clips were recorded consecutively, the phone would ask the user to save these clips to the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The issue escalated if the camera was pointed away from the user, preventing them from seeing the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. When attempting to record a third clip, the device would still be awaiting a "yes or no" response to the previous prompt about saving to the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Attempts to navigate out of this state, such as pressing the four-cursors button, would not allow a response and could lead to the device going to the main menu but becoming unresponsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. In this state, the user could not access features like the gallery or perform any other actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This behavior made the video recording function less user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Recovery Method

The only known method to recover the N95 from such an interface freeze was to power the device off and then power it back on again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

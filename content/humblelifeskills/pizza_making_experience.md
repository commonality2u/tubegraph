A recent pizza making session involved using an Ooni pizza oven with family members. The experience centered around creating homemade pizzas from scratch and enjoying time together in the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The Ooni oven was highlighted for its ease of use, even for someone described as clumsy and accident-prone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Ooni Pizza Oven
The oven used was referred to as "the Guney," which was described as the coolest pizza oven the speaker had ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This implies the use of an [[ooni_pizza_oven_features | Ooni pizza oven]]. It heats up quickly and gets "really, really hot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For optimal performance, it was left to heat for 15-20 minutes before use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The overall impression was that the oven is "amazing" and straightforward to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

[[led_lighting_technology | LED lighting technology]], exemplified by devices like the LP Micro from Light Panels, offers significant advantages for camera users, particularly in challenging environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These light panels are designed to improve [[camera_features_and_performance | video quality]] and detail by providing controlled and effective illumination.

## Key Benefits and Features

*   **Improved Low Light Performance**
    [[led_lighting_technology | LED light panels]] like the LP Micro are particularly effective in addressing [[challenges_with_low_light_conditions_in_cameras | low light conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. When used with a camera or video camera at night, in a club, bar, or any very dark situation, they cast "just enough light to give you that really nice glow" and enhance video detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This is crucial as many CMOS sensor cameras, including devices like the Flip, often "suffer from having poor [[challenges_with_low_light_conditions_in_cameras | low light]]" capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

*   **Adjustable Brightness**
    The LP Micro features a simple dial wheel on top that allows for precise adjustment of the [[led_lighting_technology | LED]] brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This enables users to control the amount of power and light output to suit specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

*   **Optimal Color Temperature**
    The [[led_lighting_technology | LEDs]] on the LP Micro are 5,300 Kelvin Daylight bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, providing a balanced light source suitable for various shooting scenarios.

*   **Portability and Power**
    The LP Micro is compact, featuring a standard hot shoe attachment that also pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It operates on four batteries (rechargeables can be used) and accepts 5 to 12 volts DC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. A single charge can last for approximately 3 to 4 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

*   **Value for Money**
    Retailing for about Â£120, the [[lp_micro_light_panel_features | LP Micro light panel]] is considered "worth every penny" for its contribution to video quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The Lambus project is an initiative focused on [[low_impact_development_and_its_goals | low impact development]] [00:00:08], aiming to provide a new direction for rural areas [00:00:15]. This approach prioritizes labor and design-intensive systems over fossil fuel-intensive ones to enhance the productivity of rural land [00:00:23]. It incorporates tools like [[Permaculture and Sustainable Farming Practices | permaculture]] [00:00:32] and simple living practices, enabling individuals to intensively tend land [00:00:38]. This contrasts with modern farming, which is often people-scarce and fossil fuel-intensive [00:00:40]. The project emphasizes utilizing more human effort, thoughtful design, and a deeper understanding of natural systems to increase rural productivity [00:00:47].

## Location and Policy Framework

The project is specifically located in Pembrokeshire, Wales, because it is currently the only area in Britain with a dedicated [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_low_impact_development_permitting | low impact development policy]] [00:01:03]. This policy creates a specific opportunity for projects like Lambus [00:01:05]. Securing planning permission for the project involved significant negotiation with Pembrokeshire County Council [00:01:13]. The special policy allows for development and habitation on agricultural land, provided the land is worked for livelihood and all activities are conducted in an ecologically sound manner [00:01:21]. The project hopes similar legislation will soon be adopted across Wales and eventually throughout Britain [00:01:40].

The land for the project was acquired about nine months prior to the interview [00:02:02], after the project sought out landowners willing to sell for such an initiative [00:01:50]. The current owners have been very supportive throughout the lengthy process [00:01:57].

## Site Selection and Existing Resources

Key assets on the selected land include:
*   A reliable source of spring water [00:02:30], which is already running [00:02:51].
*   An existing hydroelectric power plant [00:02:34], powered by an old mill leat constructed over 150 years ago [00:02:37]. The hydroelectric system requires only a small amount of refurbishment and connection to become operational [00:02:46].

Beyond these specific resources, the land is south-facing [00:03:02] and generally good [00:03:03]. It is part of a large expanse of land above 150 meters, typically used for low-productivity grazing [00:03:12]. The project aims to demonstrate that such land, which has historically been considered only suitable for grazing, can be transformed into a more productive system [00:03:54].

## Land Management and Soil Improvement

The initial step in improving the land involved removing sheep, as the area had been overgrazed for approximately 25 years due to high modern stocking ratios, which severely impacts the soil [00:04:09]. To regenerate the land and build topsoil, the project implements several sustainable practices:
*   **Tree planting:** Trees help cycle nutrients into the soil [00:04:22]. Willows planted serve multiple functions: providing firewood, acting as a windbreak to create a microclimate for [[Permaculture and Sustainable Farming Practices | forest gardens]] and cereal crops, and demarking fields [00:05:01]. They are also useful as craft wood [00:05:34].
*   **Fungal seeding:** The soil is seeded with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance connections between plants and soil elements [00:04:26].
*   **Organic matter addition:** Soil is built up using green manures, nitrogen-fixing plants, and the introduction of more organic matter [00:04:35]. This includes growing nitrogen-rich shrubs, cutting them, and returning them to the soil [00:04:43].
*   **Composting:** Large-scale composting is used to further build up the soil [00:04:48].

## Infrastructure Development and Expenditure

The primary expenditures for the project as a group have been on track ways to ensure land access [00:05:53], which allows for easier movement, particularly during winter [00:06:05]. Following this, the central provision of water and electricity are key focuses [00:06:13]. For individual families within the project, major expenses are predominantly their dwellings [00:06:25].

The approach to expenditure is minimal, emphasizing meeting needs from available resources rather than purchasing market products [00:06:48]. For instance, a dwelling is expected to cost between £2,000 and £3,000 [00:06:33]. The project leverages on-site resources like wood, clay, and stone to construct shelter [00:07:00], prioritizing the satisfaction of needs from existing materials [00:07:31].

## Resource-Based Building and Tool Making

A core philosophy is to buy tools to facilitate work rather than purchasing finished products [00:07:41]. The project also engages in significant tool-making [00:07:50], creating items like mallets from wood [00:08:02]. A homemade forge on site allows for the creation and maintenance of tools [00:08:07].

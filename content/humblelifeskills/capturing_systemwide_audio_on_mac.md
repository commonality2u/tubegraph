Capturing virtual or systemwide audio on a Mac is essential for users, especially those with [[screenflow_and_swb_audio_capture_for_m1_mac | M1 Macs]] or running Big Sur in 2021, who need a budget-friendly software solution rather than expensive hardware setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This process involves routing audio from applications, games, or background sounds into other programs like Zoom, Microsoft Meet, or OBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Evolution of Audio Capture Solutions on Mac

### Older Solutions and Their Challenges

Historically, users relied on **Soundflower**, an open-source kernel extension, for virtual audio capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. However, it became buggy and unsupported due to frequent changes in macOS operating system versions and how audio is "hooked" by the core audio subsystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The project ended in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

[[alternatives_to_soundflower_for_audio_capture | Other alternatives to Soundflower]] emerged:

*   **Rogue Amoeba Loopback**: A powerful but expensive software, though very user-friendly for those not technically inclined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **[[ishowu_audio_capture_and_its_features | iShowU Audio Capture]]**: This utility also faced difficulties keeping up with new macOS versions like Catalina, making its driver hard to find and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Recommended Solution for 2021: iShowU Instant (SWB Audio Capture)

For users with Big Sur and [[screenflow_and_swb_audio_capture_for_m1_mac | M1 Macs]], the recommended solution is **iShowU Instant**, a screen recording software that installs the necessary audio driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This software is native Apple M1 ready, offering better system resource utilization and potentially higher FPS capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

**Key Features and Benefits:**

*   **Cost-Effective**: Priced at approximately $24, it provides both a screen capture utility and the essential audio driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **SWB Audio Driver**: Installing iShowU Instant automatically adds the "SWB Audio Capture" driver to your Mac's audio settings, allowing you to select it as an audio device in applications like OBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Advanced Features Add-on**: For an additional $15, an advanced version offers [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | capturing audio from iOS devices]] (iPad or iPhone via Lightning cable) and multi-channel support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### iShowU Instant's Screen Recording Capabilities

Beyond audio capture, iShowU Instant is a robust screen recorder with various features:

*   **Presets**: Configure different settings for various recording purposes, such as local recording, gaming, or direct YouTube uploads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Video Capture**:
    *   Custom input frame rates up to 60fps, with potential for higher rates in games, though results may vary depending on game optimization or resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
    *   Supports capturing unique resolutions, like the MacBook Air's native 1440x900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Audio Enhancement**: Includes a built-in compressor to prevent audio distortion and a graphic EQ for sound shaping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Visual Elements**:
    *   Repositionable webcam screen with zoom and show/hide options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   Visualizes key presses, shows modifier keys, and can make click sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Adds text watermarks or changes background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Output and Sharing**: Allows setting custom output frame rates and direct sharing of recordings to Messages, notes, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

For users needing to capture systemwide audio on modern Macs, iShowU Instant is a highly recommended option that provides a reliable audio driver alongside comprehensive screen recording features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

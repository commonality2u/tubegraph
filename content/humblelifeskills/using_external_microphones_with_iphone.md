## The Blue Mikey Microphone

The Blue Mikey is an external microphone designed for use with mobile devices. Manufactured by Blue Microphones, known for producing quality microphones, it typically costs around £60-£70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Key features of the Blue Mikey include:
*   **Positional Stand** A small positional stand at the bottom allows the microphone to be set in different orientations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It can be positioned to point at a person's face for recording or angled towards the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Sensitivity Settings** It offers three sensitivity settings: very quiet, medium, and high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A small switch on the back controls these settings, though its design suggests it might be prone to breaking easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Connectivity** The microphone plugs into the bottom of an [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Compatibility and Usage

The Blue Mikey was primarily designed for the iPod Touch, where it works natively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### iPhone 3G Compatibility
When plugged into an [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] 3G *without* a specific application like Fire running, the microphone produces an undesirable noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It is not intended for use with the [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] 3G without the necessary software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

However, with the Fire application, the Blue Mikey can be successfully used with the [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] 3G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Upon plugging it in, a buzzing sound may occur briefly, followed by a prompt to allow its use for calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. After a few clicks, the application detects the microphone, enabling its functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The Blue Mikey is quite sensitive, capable of picking up sound effectively from about a meter away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This makes it ideal for [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | recording audio on mobile devices]], such as conducting interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Fire Application

The Fire application is crucial for enabling the Blue Mikey to function correctly with the [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] 3G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It detects and utilizes the microphone, displaying input levels as it picks up sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

A significant advantage of the Fire application is its ability to allow users to make numerous recordings without requiring an internet or broadband connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for conducting multiple interviews or [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | recording audio on mobile devices]] in environments without data access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The Lewis August Jones Foundation operates the Rising Sun Youth Leadership Program, which aims to create a better world for tomorrow by inspiring young leaders today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The speaker, having been involved with the program for seven summers, emphasizes that its successes are not found in *what* they do, but *how* they do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

The program had a profound impact on the speaker's life, shifting her aspirations from personal ambition (astronaut, big house) to working for an international medical relief charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Rising Sun as an Intentional Community

Rising Sun functions as an [[community_building_and_communication | intentional community]], similar to co-housing models, where a group of people choose to live together, sharing resources and responsibilities while actively pursuing a common vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The program brings together bright, motivated young people aged 14 to 16 from various countries, placing them together in New York for two months over the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. During this time, they build a community and engage in a carefully designed program to test it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

The development of these communities often follows Tuckman's Group Development Model, which includes four stages:
*   **Forming:** The initial stage where individuals get to know each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Storming:** Conflicts and challenges arise as members truly begin to interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Norming:** The group agrees on shared values and interaction methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Performing:** The community functions as a highly effective group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The speaker finds the "performing" stage particularly exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Forgiveness and Trust in Action

A notable example of a "performing" community occurred when a group of 50 teenage girls addressed a suspected theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Contrary to staff expectations of seeking consequences, the four-hour conversation focused on the potential threat to their mutual trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. They resolved to forgive the perpetrator and consciously double their trust in each other, deciding not to discuss the incident again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This mature response humbled the staff and demonstrated how the community's framework allowed them to move forward rather than fall apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Core Principles

The success of the program is attributed to its emphasis on key principles:

### Communication
Participants are disconnected from mobile phones and the internet, forcing them to focus inwards and engage in direct [[community_building_and_communication | communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Weekly "wisdom circles" involve small groups posing questions like "What are your hopes and fears?" or "How have you experienced culture shock?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. For some, this is their first experience of such deep conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This practice strengthens community bonds, provides a structure for negotiation, conflict resolution, and addressing community issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Valuing the Individual and Redefining Fairness
Living intensely together, individuals learn to value each member of the community in their own unique context, rather than against universal standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This leads to a re-evaluation of "fairness," where it's understood that equal contributions or equal shares may not be appropriate for a community with mixed needs and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. For these young people, who already have significant life opportunities, learning that "to whom much is given, perhaps much is expected" is a crucial lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Servant Leadership
The program fosters [[community_building_and_communication | servant leadership]], where individuals learn to lead from within the community, meeting the community's needs before their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Leadership is seen as a byproduct of the living experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Each day, a different member takes charge, coached by a staff member, with real consequences if they fail (e.g., no breakfast for the community if the leader doesn't wake up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Global Impact and Continued Connection

Rising Sun alumni consistently contribute to their [[importance_of_community_and_giving_back | local communities]] and the global community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Examples include installing solar panels on a school roof, releasing an environmental film, and organizing TEDx events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The program creates a supportive network. When young people return home, they are not alone; a global community of alumni provides support, inspiration, and opportunities for collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This [[social_media_interaction_and_community_engagement | long-lasting connection]] is perpetuated by bringing back former students as staff, ensuring a shared understanding and interaction style across different cohorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Limitations

Despite its successes, the program has limitations:
*   The single-gender groups for only seven weeks might not fully test or sustain community dynamics long-term, though it offers a taste of what a community could be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   There's a risk that the "norming" stage works too well, leading to participants not only acting and interacting similarly but also thinking in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## A Challenge to the Audience

The speaker issues a challenge to the audience, reflecting on how Rising Sun's ideas could improve shared coexistence:
*   Do you communicate with and listen to your community? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>
*   Do you know if all voices in your immediate community are heard and valued? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>
*   Can the idea of valuing every individual be explored further in your context? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>
*   Are you surrounded by people who inspire you to take on your local or global community and be the change you want to see? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>

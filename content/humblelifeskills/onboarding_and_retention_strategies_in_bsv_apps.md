Many [[bitcoin_sv_web_apps_overview | Bitcoin SV (BSV)]] applications prioritize user onboarding and retention by integrating incentives and user-friendly designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Unlike traditional centralized platforms that offer no reward for interaction, [[decentralized_applications_with_bitcoin_sv | decentralized applications]] on BSV often pay users for their engagement, creating a unique "pay for attention, receive funds" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. This approach encourages participation and helps maintain the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

## User-Friendly Wallets and Transaction Utility

The foundation for easy onboarding often starts with simplified wallet experiences:

*   **HandCash:** This wallet is praised for its simple design and user-friendly interface, feeling similar to Cash App <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. It removes typical roadblocks, making it very simple, easy, and instantaneous to send money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. HandCash utilizes [[utility_of_bitcoin_sv_in_transactions | Bitcoin SV's]] infinitely larger block size, which allows it to handle significantly more transactions per block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. It also features PayMail, allowing users to receive BSV by sending it to a simple `handcash.io` address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **API Integration:** HandCash provides an API, enabling other developers to build [[bitcoin_sv_web_apps_overview | web apps]] that integrate directly with its wallet for transactional processes using the [[utility_of_bitcoin_sv_in_transactions | Bitcoin SV]] blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This fosters an ecosystem where users can seamlessly log into decentralized applications (dApps) from their wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Incentivized Engagement and Referral Systems

Several BSV applications integrate strong [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | incentive]] mechanisms for both engagement and referrals:

*   **Relica (Instagram Equivalent):** This platform pays users for activity such as followers, likes, and comments on uploaded pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
    *   **Referral Bonus:** Users who invite friends earn 50% of the revenue generated by those invited friends whenever they earn on Relica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. This is a powerful [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | incentive]] for onboarding new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Twetch (Twitter Equivalent):** Similar to Relica, Twetch offers a 10% cut of rewards when users onboard someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This retention mechanism encourages continued interaction among users who have invited each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   **Paying for Interaction:** While it may seem unusual to pay to post, comment, or like on a platform, this model ensures that users are also compensated for their attention and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

> "you're paying for attention but you're also receiving funds for interacting and engaging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>

## Streamlining New User Onboarding

Specific tools and features are designed to simplify the initial experience for new users:

*   **PewPew:** This application allows users to send small amounts of BSV instantly to multiple handles at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. This is highly useful for:
    *   Running competitions where followers receive BSV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.
    *   Onboarding new users who have just set up a basic HandCash or Money Button account with no initial balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
    *   Rewarding engagement during live streams, such as giving BSV to active chat participants or those who ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   **Mito:** This service enables users to send Bitcoin SV directly via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. By connecting their HandCash account, users can email BSV to complete newbies, effectively onboarding them with an initial balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

## Financial Utility and Gaming Incentives

Beyond social interaction, other applications offer practical financial [[utility_of_bitcoin_sv_in_transactions | utility]] and [[blockchain_applications_in_gaming | gaming]] incentives:

*   **Pay Power Cards:** This service allows users to purchase gift cards (e.g., Amazon, Google Play, Spotify) using their BSV balance, providing a way to "cash out" earnings from the BSV ecosystem into everyday use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
*   **Haste (ILP Arcade):** Haste is the world's first Interledger Protocol (ILP) arcade, leveraging the fast transaction resolution of the [[utility_of_bitcoin_sv_in_transactions | Bitcoin SV]] blockchain, making it perfect for [[blockchain_applications_in_gaming | gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.
    *   **In-Game Earnings:** Players earn fungible Haste tokens (HST) simply by playing games within the arcade, with 43,000 HST tokens issued daily on a pro-rata basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. This allows for instantaneous payouts for winning games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Developer SDK:** Haste also provides a developer SDK, leaderboard management, user authentication, and REST API, making it attractive for [[blockchain_applications_in_gaming | game]] developers to integrate BSV-based incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. The integration of cryptocurrencies into games with fast completion times is seen as a major draw for user onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.

These strategies collectively contribute to a robust ecosystem designed to attract and retain users by offering tangible rewards and simplifying the entry process into [[decentralized_applications_with_bitcoin_sv | decentralized applications]].

Securing freelance work on platforms like Upwork can be challenging due to high competition. Many jobs quickly accumulate a large number of proposals, making it difficult to stand out or even receive a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. To gain an edge, it's crucial to be among the first to apply for newly posted jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:30">[05:54:30]</a>. One effective strategy involves leveraging Upwork's RSS feeds with notification services to get real-time alerts.

## The Challenge of Finding Upwork Jobs

When searching for jobs on Upwork, users typically browse through job feeds, such as "cinemagraph video editing" or "recommended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Regularly checking these feeds is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. However, many job postings quickly receive 20 to 50 applications, with clients already interviewing multiple candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This high volume of proposals makes it very difficult to secure a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Upwork RSS Feeds

Upwork provides a valuable feature: an RSS feed for specific job searches and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. These feeds update frequently, typically every five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. To access an RSS feed for a particular job category (e.g., "video editing"), navigate to the category on Upwork and look for the triple dots icon above the main feed row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Right-clicking on "RSS feed" will provide the URL to subscribe to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

As of December 1st (video recording date), there was an observed issue where the RSS feed URL might return a "feed not found" error, possibly due to changes in how security tokens or passwords are handled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Despite this potential temporary issue, the underlying mechanism for [[setting_up_rss_feeds_for_upwork_job_notifications | setting up RSS feeds for Upwork job notifications]] remains a core component for real-time alerts.

## Setting Up Custom Job Alerts for Upwork

To receive [[getting_early_job_notifications_for_freelance_work | early job notifications for freelance work]], a system can be established using a combination of services:

### 1. IFTTT (If This Then That)
[[Using IFTTT for job alerts on Upwork | Using IFTTT for job alerts on Upwork]] allows users to create automated "applets" that monitor RSS feeds for specific keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

*   **Setup**: Go to IFTTT, access "my applets," and create a new applet.
*   **Trigger**: Configure "New feed item matches" as the trigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Keywords**: Enter relevant keywords like "conference," "video editor," or "cinemagraph" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   **Feed URL**: Input the Upwork RSS feed URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

### 2. Pushover.net for Notifications
Pushover.net is a notification service that sends alerts to phones and desktops, similar to Google or Apple notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. It supports API connections via command line, Perl, Ruby, and PHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

*   **Integration with IFTTT**: Within the IFTTT applet, select "Send a Pushover notification" as the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   **Message Content**: The notification can include the entry title, URL, and content from the RSS feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Priority and Sound**: Users can set message priority (e.g., "emergency" for repeat notifications that bypass quiet hours) and customize the notification sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

### 3. Pullover (Unofficial Desktop Client)
While Pushover offers a desktop browser version, the unofficial open-source client called "Pullover" is recommended for pop-up notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Pullover runs in the system tray (e.g., on Mac's top bar) and receives any notifications sent to the linked Pushover account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Early Notifications

This setup provides a significant advantage:
*   **Speed**: When a new job matching specified keywords is posted and hits the RSS feed, a notification is received within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Head Start**: This allows freelancers to apply for jobs almost immediately after they are posted, providing a "head start on other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. This is particularly useful when clients are in urgent need of a freelancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

## Cost and Availability

*   **Pushover.net**: Offers a 7-day free trial, after which a one-time license costs $4.99 for unlimited notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. It supports desktop and mobile notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. SMS delivery is also an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.
*   **Pullover**: The unofficial client is free to download and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **IFTTT**: A free account is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

This system allows for highly refined job searches:
*   **Category-Specific Feeds**: Each job category or recent search on Upwork can have its own RSS feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   **Drill Down Keywords**: Instead of generic categories, users can create feeds for highly specific keywords like "Flixel," "animation," or "drone footage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. This ensures that notifications are only received for the most relevant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

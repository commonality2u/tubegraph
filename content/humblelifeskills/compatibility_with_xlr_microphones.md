The My Port Pro is designed to facilitate the use of XLR microphones, connecting them to recording devices like computers and laptops for broadcast-quality sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It is described as a "work of genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> and is noted for its durable, high-quality construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## My Port Pro Integration

The My Port Pro is designed to seamlessly integrate with XLR microphones such as the Rode NTG2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. It features a connector at the bottom that allows it to snap directly into the XLR port of a microphone, creating a flush, all-in-one unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Key Features for Compatibility

The My Port Pro includes several features that enhance its compatibility and utility with XLR microphones:
*   **Adjustable Gain Settings** It offers minimum and maximum microphone gain settings, allowing for precise control over audio input levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Headphone Monitoring** The unit includes a connector for headphones with adjustable minimum and maximum volume controls, which is a feature not always found on similar devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Phantom Power (48V)** It provides 48-volt phantom power, which is essential for powering certain condenser microphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **USB Connectivity** The My Port Pro connects to a computer via USB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, enabling direct recording into the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Subtle Indicator Light** The unit lights up white, which is less obtrusive than the "really, really blue" light of some other devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Microphones

The My Port Pro is noted to be "so much better" than other devices, including a [[comparison_with_blue_snowball_microphone | Blue Snowball]] microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The My Port Pro offers adjustments for microphone and headphone levels and phantom power, features that were absent on the [[comparison_with_blue_snowball_microphone | Blue Snowball]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

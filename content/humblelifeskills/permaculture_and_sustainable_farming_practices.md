The Lambus Project is an initiative focused on [[low_impact_development_and_its_goals | low impact development]] in rural areas, aiming to find new directions for land use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach prioritizes labor and design-intensive systems over fossil fuel-intensive ones to increase the productivity of rural land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Core Principles

The project utilizes tools like permaculture and simple living methods to enable people to intensively tend small pieces of land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This contrasts with modern farming practices, which are often people-scarce and fossil fuel-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The focus is on leveraging human effort, design principles, and an understanding of natural systems to enhance rural productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Location and Policy Context

The Lambus project is specifically located in Pembrokeshire, which is currently the only area in Britain with a specific [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_low_impact_development_permitting | low impact development policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This policy provides a specific framework for projects like Lambus, allowing development and living on agricultural land as long as the land is worked for livelihood and all activities are ecologically sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

> [!info] Permitting Challenges
> Securing planning permission for the Lambus project involved significant negotiation with Pembrokeshire County Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The project hopes that similar [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_low_impact_development_permitting | legislation]] will soon be in place across Wales and eventually throughout Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The land for the project was acquired after a search for landowners willing to sell for such an initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Site Resources and Management

The chosen land possesses two significant assets:
*   A reliable source of spring water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   An existing hydroelectric power plant, fed by an old mill leat constructed over 150 years ago, which requires only minor refurbishment to become operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

The land itself is south-facing and considered good, but it is part of a large area of higher elevation land (above 150m) typically used for low-productivity grazing in Wales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The project aims to demonstrate that [[utilizing_natural_resources_for_sustainable_living | sustainable farming]] can be successful not only on prime agricultural land but also on more commonly available, less productive land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Soil Regeneration

The topsoil at the site is relatively thin, but the project is focused on reconditioning it and building more topsoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Strategies include:
*   Removing sheep to counteract the effects of overgrazing from high modern stocking ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Planting trees to cycle nutrients into the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Seeding the soil with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance plant-soil connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   Building up soil organic matter using green manures, nitrogen-fixing plants, and extensive composting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   Growing and cutting nitrogen-rich shrubs to return organic matter to the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Multifunctional Elements

In line with permaculture design, every element within the project serves multiple functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For example, planted willows will provide firewood, act as a windbreak to create a microclimate for forest gardens and cereal crops, demarcate fields, and serve as a craft wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Expenditure and Resource Utilization

The primary expenditures for the group project have been trackways for land access and central provision of water and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. For individual families, building dwellings is a main expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

The project emphasizes fulfilling needs (e.g., shelter) by utilizing available on-site resources like wood, clay, and stone, rather than solely relying on marketplace products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This approach minimizes costs; for instance, a dwelling is expected to cost between £2,000 and £3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

The majority of purchased items are tools rather than finished products, enabling the community to create and process materials themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. There is also a significant focus on tool-making on-site, including the use of a homemade forge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Agile Messenger is a chat client demonstrated running on a Nokia N80, a Symbian S60 phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. It is accessible through the phone's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Key Features and Connectivity

Agile Messenger supports connection to multiple chat networks simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
Supported networks include:
*   IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   AOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Yahoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   MSN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

The application can connect via the N80's Wi-Fi capabilities or mobile data networks like 3G (e.g., Orange internet access point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. When on a mobile data network, the connection process may take slightly longer due to negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Despite having a registration code, the N80 version of Agile Messenger may display a "not registered" message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The interface displays small icons on the right to indicate connected networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Messaging and Media Sharing
[[features_of_agile_messenger_for_messaging_and_media_sharing | Agile Messenger]] allows users to send messages to their contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It can also be used to send updates to a Twitter feed via the chat client, though this is a less direct method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

A notable feature is the ability to send images directly. Users can take a photograph using the phone's camera and then select a contact to send it to. The image is received as a file transfer by the recipient's client (e.g., MSN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Application Management

Agile Messenger can run in the background, consuming minimal data when no messages are being sent, which is beneficial for users on data tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Available options include:
*   **Full screen mode** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   **Auto-connect on start**: Automatically connects to all chat clients when the phone is turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The application is installed as a program on the Nokia N80, allowing for quick access directly from the phone's menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Comparison with Other Platforms
[[comparison_of_agile_messenger_on_different_mobile_platforms | Agile Messenger]] is considered a superior choice for mobile chatting programs due to its multi-network connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, the version for Windows Mobile 5, particularly on the Dash, appears to have issues and is advised against installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Improvements are hoped for in future Windows Mobile 5 releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

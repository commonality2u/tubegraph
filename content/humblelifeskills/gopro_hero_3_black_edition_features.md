The GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition is praised for rediscovering video blogging due to its impressive features and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Core Capabilities
*   **Picture Quality**: The camera offers incredible picture quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Size**: Its compact size is noted as a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Stability**: The device generally operates in a fairly stable manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. While there have been a few minor issues, these are infrequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Connectivity and Output
The GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features an HDMI out port located on its side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This is a micro HDMI port, requiring a specific type of cable for connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### HDMI Output for Monitoring and Capture
*   **Clean HDMI Out**: The camera is capable of providing a clean HDMI output signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This is a significant advantage as many DSLR cameras experience issues with this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **External Monitoring**: The [[integrating_gopro_hero_3_with_external_monitors|HDMI output from the GoPro Hero 3]] can be seamlessly connected to external monitors, such as a Lilliput 7-inch LCD field monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. When connected, the monitor detects the signal and displays the camera's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **On-Screen Display (OSD)**: When connected to an external monitor, the [[HDMI output from GoPro Hero 3|HDMI output from the GoPro Hero 3]] displays various camera settings and information directly on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This includes:
    *   Protune status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
    *   Resolution (e.g., 1080 25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
    *   Battery level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
    *   Wi-Fi status (e.g., Wi-Fi off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
    *   Setup prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>
    *   All camera settings, which are visible on the HDMI screen as they are navigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Integration with Capture Devices
The [[HDMI output from GoPro Hero 3|GoPro Hero 3's HDMI output]] can also be used with capture cards like the [[using_gopro_with_blackmagic_intensity_extreme|Blackmagic Intensity Extreme]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This card is designed to capture full-frame HD video up to 1080p, offloading the processing from the computer's graphics card and CPU, resulting in super-quick, low-latency capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Considerations for HDMI Use
*   **Port Strain**: Due to the weight of an HDMI cable, there is a concern that the port could become damaged or "thrashed" quickly without proper cable management or a clip block system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **OSD Removal**: While the on-screen display provides useful information, users may need to find a setting to disable this feedback for a completely clean output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

A "link page" or "bio page" serves as a single URL acting as a portal to multiple links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. These pages are commonly used in social media bios on platforms like Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The concept was largely inspired by similar link pages used by musicians for linking to various streaming platforms like Deezer and iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Why Consider Multiple Bio Pages?

Initially, many users opted for services like Linktree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, or more powerful alternatives like Beacons.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, services like Beacons.ai can be costly, pricing at around $10 a month or $120 a year just for a basic portal page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Cost-Effective Solutions

An alternative to expensive link page services is to use a web app like Carrd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Carrd allows for the creation of simple bio pages that display well on mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Carrd offers a significant [[costeffectiveness_of_using_carrd_for_link_pages | cost-effective solution]]:
*   A basic setup on Carrd can cost around $9 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   For approximately $19 a year, users can create up to 10 separate sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This means one can create a primary bio page and nine additional pages for friends or other projects, all while remaining significantly cheaper than platforms like Beacons.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Carrd also offers various add-on elements for enhanced customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Tailoring Content for Different Audiences

A key benefit of having multiple bio pages is the ability to tailor content for different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. For example, one could create:
*   A specific bio page for Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Another bio page for TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   A distinct bio page for YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Building separate pages allows for highly targeted content presentation for each social media audience, all while remaining more affordable than other dedicated link-in-bio services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

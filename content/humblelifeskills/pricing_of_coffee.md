A latte was purchased for one pound, which was considered a "good deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13"></a>. The coffee itself appeared to be good quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19"></a>.

The location where the coffee was purchased was a new [[coffee_shop_experience | coffee shop experience]] for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23"></a>. They described it as a "nice place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25"></a> with a "nice menu" that was "pretty good nice and organized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58"></a>. The one-pound price for the coffee was deemed "not bad at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22"></a>.

Birds, particularly domesticated ones, can be vulnerable to attacks from predators. Even within what might seem like a secure enclosure, predators can pose a significant threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Threats and Injuries
Crows are identified as a potential predator capable of severe harm to birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. A bird attacked by a predator like a crow can be "absolutely mutilated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Injuries can include active bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> and feathers being ripped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Impact of Attack
Beyond physical injuries, an attack can leave a bird "pretty scared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> and lead to significant trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The [[stress_in_domesticated_birds | stress]] resulting from such an encounter can severely affect them and potentially lead to their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, even if the bird appears to be resting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Recovery and Care
Timely intervention to remove a bird from a dangerous situation can save its life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. For [[injured_birds_and_first_aid | injured birds]], assessing their condition for active bleeding and trauma is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. While rescue is vital, the long-term effects of trauma and stress on a bird's health mean careful monitoring is needed to prevent further decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

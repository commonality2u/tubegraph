## N95 Recording Bug

A significant bug has been identified with the N95 during recording sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Description of the Bug

When a recording is stopped, the device prompts the user to send the clip to one of its destinations, such as an integrated service like [[IShowU Audio Capture and its features | Shu]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. If multiple clips are recorded in succession, the N95 asks if the user wants to save those clips to the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

A problem arises when the camera is pointing towards the user, making the screen inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. If the user presses the record button a third time in this scenario, the device remains unresponsive, still waiting for a "yes" or "no" answer to the question of saving to the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### User Impact and Workaround

Attempting to exit this frozen state using the four-cursors button proved futile, as the device would not allow any interaction, including selecting "yes" or "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This action led the device to the main menu, from which the user was unable to navigate, access the gallery, or perform any other function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The presence of these bugs in the video recording interface significantly diminishes the N95's user-friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The only way to resolve the issue was to power the device off and then on again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

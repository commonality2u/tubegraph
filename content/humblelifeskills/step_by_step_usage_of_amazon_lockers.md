The following details the experience of retrieving a package from an [[overview_of_amazon_locker_system | Amazon Locker]] system. The individual tested out the system to experience it firsthand, despite normally receiving packages in the studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The idea of picking up items at a shopping mall after work was appealing, allowing for additional shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

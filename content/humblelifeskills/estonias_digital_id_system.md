Estonia has developed and implemented the world's first global digital ID system, which forms the core of its e-residency program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This system is a testament to Estonia's confidence in its technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Purpose and Motivation
The idea behind Estonia's e-residency and its digital ID system is largely driven by concepts such as [[digital_nomads_and_location_independence | digital nomads]] and [[digital_nomads_and_location_independence | location independence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. By offering a digital ID to individuals from other nations, Estonia makes a "smart power move," positioning itself to attract global talent and retain economic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This initiative anticipates a future where billions of freelancers and digital nomads work independently across the globe by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. By allowing individuals to set up companies and manage their finances through the Estonian digital ID, the country aims to keep wealth within its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. As the first nation to offer a global digital ID, Estonia benefits from a "first mover advantage," as users tend to remain with their initial entry point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Features and Uses
Estonia's own citizens already utilize their digital ID system for a wide range of services, including public transport, tracking, document encryption, and various other functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. For e-residents, the digital ID card serves as a "glorified digital ID/pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Key capabilities include:

*   **Business Setup**: Enabling individuals to [[benefits_of_eresidency_for_digital_services_and_business_setup_in_estonia | set up a company in the cloud]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Financial Management**: Facilitating accounting and tax payments within Estonia, even for those working [[digital_nomads_and_location_independence | location independently]] and earning income from virtual sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Security**: The system utilizes 248-bit encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Digital Signatures**: Users can [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digitally sign encrypted documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## E-residency vs. Physical Residency
It is important to note that [[features_and_uses_of_the_estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card | e-residency does not confer actual residency]] in Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. E-residents cannot vote or engage in other activities reserved for physical residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Cost
Initially, the cost for e-residency was €50, a price reduction that lasted until the end of January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The price has since doubled to €100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

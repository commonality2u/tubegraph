## Current Connectivity
The current home setup includes a [[wifi_router_setup | WiFi router]] that provides a [[using_wifi_and_mobile_data_for_connectivity | WiFi connection]] for a phone, allowing internet access throughout the downstairs area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Motivation for Extension
The primary reason for considering extending WiFi range is the inconvenience and cost associated with current connectivity options. To send clips to the internet, it's necessary to be at home to use the wireless network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Using Orange's mobile data packages is not preferred due to their high cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Therefore, there's a desire to broaden the existing WiFi range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Proposed Solution: [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | WiFi Cloud]]
It is possible to [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | set up a WiFi cloud]] to extend the network's reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For the current house, a device could be placed on the side of the building, with wiring routed from the loft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Technical Requirements
To establish a [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | WiFi cloud]], a [[authentication_using_radius_for_wifi_service | Radius server]] is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The individual already possesses 19-inch rack servers that could potentially be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Hardware Considerations
A [[connecting_photo_frame_to_a_wireless_network | WiFi aerial]], either a flat panel or a standard aerial, is considered for transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Potential Range and Service Offering
With a good line of sight or a reasonably high pole, it's believed that transmission is possible for distances up to five to ten miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
If [[authentication_using_radius_for_wifi_service | authentication using Radius]] can be implemented to manage user logins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, the extended WiFi could be advertised as a service for others, such as those using phones or PDAs, to access the internet without incurring high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Seeking Assistance
Assistance is being sought from individuals with WiFi knowledge to help with [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | setting up a WiFi cloud]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Any ideas or suggestions are welcomed via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

An online blog was established to support the [[phil_campbell_convention | International Phil Campbell Convention]] held in [[phil_campbell_alabama | Phil Campbell, Alabama]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Purpose and Access

The blog, accessible at Philcampbell.post.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, was set up by Phil Campbell, a writer and organizer of the convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It allows individuals to directly contribute content by sending an email to "Phil campbell.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. By including a title in the subject line, users can blog directly to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

This initiative aimed to gather and engage the wider [[global_phil_campbell_gathering | Phil Campbell community]] in preparation for the convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

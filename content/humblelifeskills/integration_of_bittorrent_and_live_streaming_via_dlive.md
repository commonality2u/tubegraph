This article discusses the strategic acquisitions and technological integrations aimed at revolutionizing decentralized content distribution and live streaming, focusing on BitTorrent, Tron, and DLive.

## BitTorrent's Decentralized Roots and Acquisition by Tron

BitTorrent, originally rooted in a peer-to-peer system, was inherently decentralized, making it a logical candidate for further decentralization efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The creator of BitTorrent eventually sold the company for $126 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

In a significant development, the blockchain company [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | Tron bought BitTorrent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Tron is recognized for its super-fast blockchain and high transaction records per second, which is crucial for scalability, especially for a system like BitTorrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This acquisition was seen as an interesting match due to the need for a blockchain that can handle the high transaction volume of BitTorrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The BTT Token and Project Atlas

Following the acquisition, Tron created a token for BitTorrent called BTT (BitTorrent Token), aiming to tokenize "the world's largest decentralized file-sharing protocol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. While BitTorrent boasts 100 million users, this figure represents people who have used blockchain technology, not necessarily users of the Tron-integrated BitTorrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Most current BitTorrent users download content, often free movies, without paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The proposition for BTT is to integrate it into the BitTorrent software, allowing users to choose download speeds (slow, medium, fast) and potentially get paid to seed content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This would require users to operate a 24/7 online node and earn tokens based on their peering and sharing of data, particularly for "fast lane" access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This system would utilize a TRC-10 token, which is easier for developers to integrate, potentially benefiting video hosting communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Tron's project, Project Atlas, aims to create a system for sharing and exchanging files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The vision is for users to unconsciously engage with this system, possibly as a browser plugin, allowing video uploads to a decentralized cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Similar to Bitcoin miners earning royalties for checking transactions, participants could earn TRC-10 tokens for contributing to the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## DLive's Acquisition by Tron/BitTorrent

On the last day of 2019, news broke that DLive, a [[live_streaming_and_its_evolution | live streaming platform]], had been acquired by Tron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. DLive originated on the Steam blockchain, functioning as an experiment for its first year before moving to the Lino blockchain, and now to Tron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

This acquisition is seen as a "marriage made in heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Synergy for Decentralized Live Streaming and Storage

The acquisition of DLive by Tron and its integration with BitTorrent suggests a strategic move to address the significant challenges of video storage and content hosting in both centralized and decentralized networks: the need for numerous nodes, high uptime, and substantial storage space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

The vision involves integrating a new BitTorrent client that runs in the background, creating a global peer-to-peer network for video sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. While the streaming aspect is presumed to rely on centralized or high-latency servers for now, an ideal future would involve a "chunked" BitTorrent streaming method where every user is part of the streaming network, earning tokens for providing data packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

For content creators, this integration could offer terabytes of decentralized storage that remains available, with tokens used to pay others for peering services when the creator is offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This collaborative model could facilitate a shift away from centralized platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Investment Perspective
Both Tron (rank 12 on CoinMarketCap) and BTT (rank 64) are considered inexpensive investment opportunities for those looking into decentralized hosting in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

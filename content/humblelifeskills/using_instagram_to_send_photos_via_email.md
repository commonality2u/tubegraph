This article outlines how to use Instagram's email sharing feature to send photos to devices like a Kodak Pulse photo frame, allowing for a passive viewing experience of shared content.

## Overview

A Kodak Pulse photo frame, which usually cycles through stored photos, can be configured to receive images via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This functionality allows users to send photos directly from Instagram to the photo frame's dedicated email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This method means that photos appear on the frame without the need to actively browse Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Initially, a Kodak Pulse photo frame might not display photos if its [[connecting_photo_frame_to_a_wireless_network | wireless network]] is not set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Once the [[setting_up_a_kodak_pulse_photo_frame | photo frame is set up]] and connected, its email address can be used as a destination for shared content.

## Sending Photos from Instagram via Email

To send a photo from Instagram to an email address:

1.  **Take or Select a Photo**: Capture a new photo with Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  **Access Sharing Options**: After editing your photo, proceed to the [[sharing_options_on_instagram | sharing options]] screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. You will see choices such as Twitter, Facebook, and Email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
    *   If "Email" is not immediately visible, select "Show more" to reveal additional options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
3.  **[[configuring_email_for_kodak_photo_frame | Configure the Email Address]]**:
    *   Choose the "Email" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   Select "Add an email address" or "Enter new address" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   Input the desired email address. For a Kodak Pulse photo frame, the format used as an example is "Instagram@Kodakps.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
4.  **Share the Photo**: Once the email address is configured, you can select it from your sharing options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The photo will then be sent to that address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

This process allows for a continuous display of personal or shared moments on a digital photo frame, streamlining the viewing experience of content from social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

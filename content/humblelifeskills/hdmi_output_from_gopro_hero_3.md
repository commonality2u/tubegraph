The [[gopro_hero_3_black_edition_features | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] is noted for its ability to output video via HDMI, a feature many users inquire about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This capability allows for connection to external monitors and capture devices for viewing or recording high-quality footage.

## Connecting HDMI to the GoPro Hero 3

The GoPro Hero 3 features a micro HDMI port located on its side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. To use this, a specialized micro HDMI cable is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The speaker acquired both a short cable and a more robust "Cable Matters" brand cable for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

While the connection of the micro HDMI cable into the GoPro Hero 3 feels "fairly solid," there is a concern about the long-term durability of the port. The weight of the cable can pull on the port, suggesting a need for a clip-block system or some form of cable management to prevent damage over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## HDMI Output Characteristics

A key aspect of HDMI output from cameras is the concept of "clean HDMI out," which refers to a signal without on-screen display (OSD) elements like battery indicators or settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. While some DSLRs, like the Nikon D800, offer clean HDMI out, others, like earlier Canon Mark III models, did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Integration with External Monitors

The speaker tested the HDMI output with a Lilliput seven-inch LCD field monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This monitor is portable and designed for outdoor viewing, useful for framing shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Upon connecting the [[gopro_hero_3_black_edition_features | GoPro Hero 3]] to the Lilliput monitor, the monitor successfully detected a signal and displayed the camera's feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. However, the output was not "clean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The monitor displayed various on-screen elements, including:
*   "Protune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   Video resolution and frame rate (e.g., "1080 25") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   Battery indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
*   Wi-Fi status ("Wi-Fi off") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   Setup prompts and menu options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>

The presence of these on-screen elements means that while a picture is easily obtained, further investigation is needed to determine if there's a setting to turn off all feedback on the HDMI output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Alternative Capture Methods

The speaker also mentioned owning a Mac Pro with a [[using_gopro_with_blackmagic_intensity_extreme | Blackmagic Intensity Extreme]] card, which is capable of capturing full-frame HD video up to 1080p with low latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. However, this setup was not used for the direct output test due to issues with recording high-definition videos on that particular machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

It is possible to get a clear picture out of the [[gopro_rig_for_hero3 | GoPro Hero 3]] via its HDMI output without complex settings adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The HDMI output from the [[gopro_rig_for_hero3 | Hero3]] through a field monitor "works really really sweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The main challenge remains in identifying if the on-screen display elements can be removed for a truly "clean" HDMI feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

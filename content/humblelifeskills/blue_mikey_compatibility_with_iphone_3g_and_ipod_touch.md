The Blue Mikey is an external microphone designed for use with Apple devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It attaches to the bottom of an [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> or iPod Touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## [[blue_mikey_microphone_features | Features of the Blue Mikey]]
The Blue Mikey features a positional design, allowing it to be set in different orientations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It offers three sensitivity settings: very quiet, medium, and high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A small switch on the back controls these settings, though its durability has been noted as a potential area for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The Blue Mikey is priced around 60-70 pounds and is manufactured by Blue Microphones, known for producing quality microphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Compatibility and Usage
### iPod Touch
The Blue Mikey works natively with the iPod Touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### iPhone 3G
While not officially supported for the iPhone 3G without specific software, the Blue Mikey can be used effectively with the "Fire" application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Without the "Fire" application loaded, plugging the Blue Mikey into an iPhone 3G produces an undesirable noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Using with "Fire" Application
The "Fire" application detects the Blue Mikey and allows its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. When plugged in while "Fire" is active, there might be a brief buzzing sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The application prompts the user to confirm use and call reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. After a few clicks, the microphone is detected and becomes operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The Blue Mikey is described as quite sensitive, picking up sound from approximately a meter away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This makes it ideal for recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. A significant advantage of the "Fire" application is its ability to record multiple recordings on the iPhone without requiring an immediate data or broadband connection to send files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This allows for continuous interviewing or recording without connectivity concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The microphone's positional capabilities allow it to be oriented for various recording scenarios, such as standing it up to point at a speaker's face or positioning it towards the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The acquisition of BitTorrent by Tron marks a significant step towards truly decentralized file sharing, leveraging BitTorrent's peer-to-peer roots with Tron's blockchain capabilities and TRC tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## BitTorrent's Decentralized Foundation

BitTorrent, originally a peer-to-peer system, is inherently suited for decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Its creator sold it to Tron for $126 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | acquisition of BitTorrent by Tron]] was considered interesting because Tron is known for its fast blockchain and high transaction processing speed, capable of handling many transactions per second, which is essential for BitTorrent's scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The BitTorrent Token (BTT)

Following the acquisition, Tron created a token for BitTorrent called BTT, aiming to tokenize "the world's largest decentralized file sharing protocol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While BitTorrent boasts 100 million users, this figure primarily refers to individuals who have used BitTorrent in general, not necessarily those using the Tron-integrated version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The core proposition for the BTT token is to incentivize users to seed content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This means users with high uptime and fast connections (e.g., gigabit connections) could get paid in tokens for sharing files, effectively providing "fast lane" access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This system would require nodes to be online 24/7, earning tokens based on their peering and data sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## TRC Tokens

Tron utilizes TRC-10 and TRC-20 tokens, similar in approach to Ethereum's ERC-20 token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The TRC-20 token is backward-compatible with ERC-20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The TRC-10 token is noted for being easier to integrate from a developer's perspective, which could be beneficial for those looking to monetize video hosting communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This could give Tron and BitTorrent a "leg up" on IPFS if they can effectively integrate their technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Project Atlas

One of the key projects Tron is undertaking with BitTorrent is "Project Atlas," which aims to establish a new way to share and exchange files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This project seeks to leverage BitTorrent's massive user base and its significant contribution to internet traffic (33%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The vision is for users to upload video into a decentralized cloud, with "miners" or nodes getting paid in TRC-10 tokens for checking transactions and providing peering services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## DLive Acquisition and Future Potential

The [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | acquisition of DLive]] (a live streaming platform that originated on the [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Steem blockchain]]) by Tron and BitTorrent on the last day of 2019 signifies a "marriage made in heaven" for decentralized video storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The biggest challenge for both centralized and [[benefits_and_setup_of_decentralized_video_hosting_with_ipfs | decentralized networks]] is storing content, requiring many nodes, high uptime, and significant storage space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

By integrating DLive with BitTorrent, the aim is to create a global peer-to-peer network where videos are shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. While streaming might require some centralized nodes for low latency, the vision is for a chunked BitTorrent streaming system where every user contributes to the network and gets paid in tokens for providing data packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

This integration suggests a future where content creators can access significant decentralized storage by buying BTT tokens, which then compensate other users for providing peering services when the creator is offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The potential for a fully [[future_potential_of_blockchain_technology_for_decentralized_networks | decentralized peer-to-peer network]] that could challenge centralized platforms like YouTube and Twitch is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

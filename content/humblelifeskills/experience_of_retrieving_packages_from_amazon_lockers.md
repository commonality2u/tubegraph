Testing the [[overview_of_amazon_locker_system | Amazon Locker system]] was a primary goal for the speaker, who normally receives packages in the studio, but wanted to personally test the retrieval experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The idea of retrieving items from a shopping mall after work, allowing for additional shopping, was appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Arrival and Location

The location chosen for the test was a Staples store, which also offered DHL services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The speaker expressed hope that it was the correct Staples location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Retrieval Process

Upon arrival, the speaker noted the "Box" and reacted with surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The [[step_by_step_usage_of_amazon_lockers | retrieval process]] involved a "secret draw open" mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The system informed the user which specific locker their package was in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It was observed that the locker system was quite large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, with the package located in the bottom locker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Overall Experience

The overall experience of retrieving the package was described as "no hassle, no bother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, indicating a positive impression of the [[benefits_of_using_amazon_lockers | Amazon Locker system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

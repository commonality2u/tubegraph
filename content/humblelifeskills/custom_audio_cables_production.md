The company "Your Custom Cable.com" specializes in the production of [[custom_cables_for_audio_devices | custom cables for audio devices]], specifically designed for individual needs and specific lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34">[06:34]</a>.

## Company Origin and [[growth_of_a_custom_cable_business | Growth]]

The business began approximately two years prior to the interview, starting with online sales of cables before launching its own website due to growing success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17">[01:17]</a>. The founders initially worked in [[audio_engineering_and_live_event_setups | audio engineering]] for rock concerts, which provided the foundational experience for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>.

The owner, Yes For Slo from the Netherlands, anticipates significant [[growth_of_a_custom_cable_business | growth]] in the coming two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48">[04:48]</a>. His wife will join the company to manage administration and web design, and they are actively seeking qualified personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55">[04:55]</a>.

## Customization and Production

The core strength of the company lies in its ability to produce cables to exact custom specifications, down to the centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36">[06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03">[09:03]</a>. Unlike other companies that offer fixed lengths (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 meters), Your Custom Cable.com cuts material from a roll, ensuring the customer receives the precise length required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20">[07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31">[07:31]</a>. This approach does not make custom cables more expensive in the long run, as any leftover pieces can be utilized for other orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44">[07:44]</a>.

### Production Timeframes
*   **Simple connections**: Typically take 5 to 10 minutes to assemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15">[03:15]</a>.
*   **Large systems**: For complex setups, such as the thick cables running from stages to mixing consoles at big concerts, a system can take about three weeks to build and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05">[04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>. Special requirements from customers may extend this time further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>.

### Pricing
Discounts are available for bulk purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36">[03:36]</a>.

## Applications and Problem-Solving

The company produces cables for various applications, including those for guitarists and specialized audio systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>. Their products aim to deliver [[broadcast_quality_sound_for_portable_recording | broadcast quality sound for portable recording]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56">[09:56]</a>.

### Addressing [[challenges_in_audio_technology | Audio Technology Challenges]]
The company actively works on solutions for specific customer needs, such as connecting microphones to iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46">[10:46]</a>. They have identified and propose a solution for the common issue where unplugging a microphone from an iPhone causes music playback to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48">[11:48]</a>. This occurs because the iPhone's headset plug, with its volume and skip buttons, retains a current that signals music playback when unplugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56">[11:56]</a>. The proposed solution involves unplugging the microphone from the Rode mic first, then disconnecting the four-pin connector from the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16">[12:16]</a>.

They are also exploring a very small cable design to allow headphone monitoring when using external mics with iPhones, despite the challenge of the iPhone's small plug size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11">[13:11]</a>. This requires testing whether the audio signal passes through the four-pin connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34">[13:34]</a>. A simple test involves using the iPhone's internal mic with headphones plugged in: if one can hear oneself, the signal is passing through the four-pin connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48">[14:48]</a>.

Many social media platforms, such as Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram, typically allow for only a single URL in their bio section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. To overcome this limitation, users often employ a "link page" which acts as a portal to a collection of other links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This concept was inspired by similar pages used by musicians to link to various platforms like Deezer and iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Traditional Link Page Solutions and Their Drawbacks

Initially, many users opted for services like Linktree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. As needs evolved, some sought more powerful alternatives, such as Beacons.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While Beacons.ai was favored for its capabilities, it experienced issues, including being blocked on TikTok at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. A significant drawback of Beacons.ai is its pricing structure, which is approximately $10 per month, totaling $120 per year, for what is essentially a simple portal page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

A [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] is a device designed to convert analog audio from records into digital formats, making it accessible for modern use and preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This type of turntable is particularly useful for digitizing large collections of old records, such as 78 RPMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Core Features

*   **Connectivity**: The [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] connects directly to a computer (PC or Mac) via a USB cable located underneath the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Software Inclusion**: It typically comes bundled with [[software_compatibility_with_usb_turntable | Audacity]], a free wave program compatible with both Mac and PC, which facilitates the recording process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Size and Design**: The unit is described as a "normal size deck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> and is quite large, even considered "huge" by some users, suggesting a less condensed design than might be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Outputs**:
    *   **USB Port**: For digital audio transfer to a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   **Line Out**: A standard audio output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   **RCA Phono/Line**: RCA outputs allow connection to traditional audio systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Inputs**: The device also features RCA line inputs, which allows other audio sources to be fed into the turntable and recorded through its system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Included Components**: Essential components include a counterweight, needle, and belt, which are often found packaged within the boxing materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Functionality

### Record Conversion
The primary function is to [[converting_78_rpm_records_to_digital_format | convert records to digital format]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It is particularly highlighted for [[converting_78_rpm_records_with_usb_turntable | converting 78 RPM records]], which are noted for being "really thick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Playback and Speed Control
*   **Audio Preview**: Users can preview the audio coming through the record player before recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Software Speed Adjustment**: While the turntable plays records, the included software allows for the adjustment of playback speed. For instance, the speed of 78 RPM records can be reduced within the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It has been observed that 33 RPM records might play slightly too slow, requiring software speed adjustments to achieve the correct playback speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Turntable Heads and Needles
The turntable typically does not come with multiple heads or needles initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. However, different [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | heads and needles]] can be purchased separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. A specific 78 RPM head is often recommended or required, possibly because the needle is thicker to accommodate the "really really thick" old 78 RPM records and their more defined grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Setup and Troubleshooting
[[setting_up_and_using_a_usb_turntable | Setting up]] the turntable involves connecting the USB cable to a computer and installing the belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

A common issue encountered during initial use is skipping playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This is often resolved by ensuring the counterweight is properly installed, as its absence means "no force on the needle to stay down," causing it to jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This highlights a key aspect of [[troubleshooting_common_issues_with_the_usb_turntable | troubleshooting common issues]].

## Cost
In the UK, these units are priced around £120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Additional play heads cost approximately £15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

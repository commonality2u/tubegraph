Virtual cards offer a secure method for online transactions, providing an added layer of protection against fraud and unauthorized access to your primary financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## What is a Virtual Card?

A virtual card functions similarly to a physical debit or credit card but exists solely in digital form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. It can be used for online payments as soon as it's created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Benefits of Using Virtual Cards

Virtual cards provide several advantages for secure online spending:

*   **Enhanced Security**
    *   **Protection Against Skimming/Scamming**: If a virtual card is compromised (skimmed or scammed), it does not affect your main bank card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This is particularly beneficial for [[Digital signature using an Estonian digital ID card | digital nomads]] or individuals traveling to different countries where card security might be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   **Limited Exposure**: You can load a virtual card with a specific amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. If the card details are ever breached, the maximum loss is limited to the amount loaded onto that specific virtual card, rather than your entire account balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: Some platforms offer virtual cards for free, which is often a significant saving compared to other services that might charge a fee (e.g., Â£1.50 on Crypto Pay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This free offering might be an incentive for early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## How to Create and Use a Virtual Card

1.  **Creation**: On some platforms, virtual cards can be added through the "cards" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. They can often be created for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
2.  **Activation**: To activate a virtual card, users typically need to undergo an identity verification process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This usually involves providing passport details or similar identity documents, especially as users approach certain transaction limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
3.  **Usage**: Once activated, the platform provides all the necessary card details (card number, expiry date, CVV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. These details can then be used for online purchases, such as on e-commerce sites like Amazon, or to buy digital vouchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Managing Virtual Cards

Platforms typically allow users to manage their virtual cards by:
*   Renaming them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>
*   Removing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>
*   Loading funds onto them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>

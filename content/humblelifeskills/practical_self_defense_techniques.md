Max Self Defense emphasizes a fun approach to the serious subject of self-defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Founded by Mark Wingfield and Mark Ram, [[introduction_to_max_self_defense | Max Self Defense]] offers simple, effective self-defense training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Core Approach

The training extracts the most practical and easiest elements from [[application_of_martial_arts_in_self_defense | martial arts]] to create effective self-defense techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. While primarily based in the East Midlands, training is available across the [[self_defense_training_in_the_uk_and_europe | UK and Europe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Benefits of Training

Beyond personal safety for individuals, loved ones, and staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, the training also fosters [[team_building_through_self_defense | effective team building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Participants bond with colleagues while engaging in stress-relieving activities like hitting bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It is described as "team building with a purpose" that brings out the best in people and builds confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The ultimate goal is to prepare individuals for conflict, enabling them to walk away if possible, akin to having first aid in reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Demonstrated Techniques

### The Fence

The "fence" is a technique where one maintains distance from a potential aggressor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. By stepping back and keeping the aggressor at bay, the individual creates space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. If an attack occurs, this position allows for a cover and counter-move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### The Pleading Fence

An extension of the "fence," the "pleading fence" involves making the aggressor believe they are in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. When an attacker grabs, the defender raises their hands as if protecting their face and pleads, appearing non-threatening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This stance can then transition into a defensive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Cameras frequently encounter significant difficulties when operating in environments with poor lighting.

## Specific Camera Examples
The Flip camcorder, for instance, is noted for suffering from poor low light performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## General Issues with CMOS Sensors
This struggle with low light is not exclusive to specific models; a significant number of cameras utilizing CMOS sensors share this same problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This highlights a general challenge in [[camera_features_and_performance | camera features and performance]] related to sensor technology.

## Addressing Low Light Conditions
To mitigate these challenges, external lighting solutions can be employed. For example, a device like the LP Micro from Light Panels is beneficial in dark situations such as a club, a bar, or any very dark setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This LED-enabled light panel casts sufficient light to provide a "nice glow" and enhances video detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The LP Micro utilizes 5,300 Kelvin Daylight bulbs and operates for about 3 to 4 hours on four batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Its ability to add detail in low light scenarios underscores the [[benefits_of_led_lighting_for_cameras | benefits of LED lighting for cameras]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

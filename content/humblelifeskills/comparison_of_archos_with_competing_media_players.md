The Archos line of portable media devices, including the [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]] and the newer [[features_of_the_archos_aos_604 | AOS 604]], offers features that differentiate them from competitors like the Apple iPod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## Archos vs. iPod

Archos devices are considered by some to be a better player than the iPod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. While Archos has introduced models like the Archos 404, which is a smaller version with the same screen size as an [[comparison_with_other_portable_media_devices | iPod Video]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, the [[comparison_with_other_portable_media_devices | iPod Video]] is deemed inferior in terms of [[video_quality_and_storage_options_on_archos_av500 | video quality]] compared to Archos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### Archos 404

The Archos 404, despite its unfortunate name (which references a bad web link) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, is seen as Archos's attempt to compete in the market segment dominated by the [[comparison_with_other_portable_media_devices | iPod Video]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. However, given the [[video_quality_and_storage_options_on_archos_av500 | superior video quality]] of Archos devices, some believe the 404 model was an unnecessary product for Archos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

## Archos Features and Connectivity

Archos devices function as portable media players for storing MPEG-4 and DivX files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. The [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]] can store content downloaded from services like FireAnt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### Archos AOS 604 Enhancements

The [[features_of_the_archos_aos_604 | AOS 604]] introduced several design improvements over the [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]]:
*   **Massive Screen**: The 604 features a significantly larger screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   **Controls**: Controls are moved to the right-hand side, making them more accessible compared to the [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]]'s somewhat awkward buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   **Design**: The speaker has been relocated from the top to the bottom, optimizing screen "real estate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The device also appears skinnier than the thicker [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Native Playback**: The [[features_of_the_archos_aos_604 | AOS 604]] can natively play DVD files, specifically MPEG-2 and VOB formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Codec Support**: It supports codec plugins, allowing for compatibility with various formats like Ogg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The 604 also features serious hardware to decode H.264 video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

### [[storage_capabilities_of_the_archos_av500 | Storage Concerns]]

One concern with the [[features_of_the_archos_aos_604 | Archos 604]] is that it currently only comes in a 30GB version, with no 100GB option available yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. The lack of a higher [[storage_capabilities_of_the_archos_av500 | storage capacity]] makes it less appealing for purchase until a 100GB version is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

### DVR Capabilities

Both the [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]] and [[features_of_the_archos_aos_604 | 604]] models support [[digital_video_recording_with_the_archos_av500 | DVR functionality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Archos has introduced a dedicated DVR station, a base unit with various inputs (infrared, audio in, composite in) that allows users to record content directly from sources like Sky or TV to MP4 files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### [[compatibility_of_archos_devices_with_windows | Windows Centricity]]

A potential concern for Archos is its historical centricity to Windows and Windows Media Player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. There is a concern that Microsoft might acquire Archos, which would be seen as a shame, as a Microsoft-branded product might not be appealing to current Archos users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Archos is described as a "little French company" that has built a strong reputation by developing quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

[[Estonias digital ID system | Estonia's e-residency digital ID card]] enables users to digitally sign documents with ease and security, mimicking the act of in-person signing through encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## [[Process of digitally signing multiple documents | Digital Signing Process]]

The primary application used for [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digital signatures]] with the e-residency card is [[digidoc3_application_for_document_signing | DigiDoc3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

### Requirements
To sign documents, the e-residency card must be valid and inserted into a card reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Steps
1.  **Load Documents**: Users can load multiple documents, including those in .docx format, to be signed in bulk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
2.  **Specify Output Folder**: The application prompts the user to select an output folder for the signed documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
3.  **Authentication (PIN1)**: The software requires the user's PIN1 code for digital authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
4.  **Signing (PIN2)**: To complete the digital signature, the user must enter their PIN2 code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
5.  **Completion**: Once the PIN2 is entered, the documents are signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, and the signature is validated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Output Format
Signed documents are saved in the .bdoc format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. BDoc is the default [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digital signature]] format in Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, functioning similarly to a zip file that can contain multiple signed documents within a single container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Usage Limits
Some applications or services may impose a limit on the number of signatures per month, such as 10 signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The process is described as "super super easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

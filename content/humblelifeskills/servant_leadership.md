The Lewis August Jones Foundation's [[youth_leadership_program | Youth Leadership Program]], known as Rising Sun, aims to create a better world for tomorrow by inspiring young leaders today [00:00:53]. The program emphasizes a concept of leadership that arises organically from shared community experiences.

## What is Rising Sun?
Rising Sun is an intentional community, similar to co-housing, where a group of people choose to live together, sharing resources and responsibilities, and actively pursuing a common vision [00:02:12]. Each summer, bright and motivated young people aged 14 to 16, selected from various countries, are brought together in New York for two months [00:02:30]. During this period, they build a community and engage in a carefully designed program [00:02:52].

The community development model, as described by Tuckman, involves four stages:
*   **Forming:** Getting to know each other and playing nicely [00:03:07].
*   **Storming:** Dealing with initial conflicts and differing personalities [00:03:14].
*   **Norming:** Agreeing on shared values and interaction methods [00:03:21].
*   **Performing:** Functioning as a highly effective group [00:03:29].

The speaker found the "performing" stage particularly exciting [00:03:33].

## Promoting Servant Leadership
Rising Sun promotes **servant leadership**, an idea of leadership that stems from within the community itself [00:11:00]. This approach emphasizes meeting the community's needs before one's own [00:11:04]. It teaches that leadership does not necessarily mean being at the front or giving orders [00:11:12].

Leadership is viewed as a byproduct of the entire program [00:11:20]. While concepts of leadership and styles are openly discussed, the core lessons are learned through the living experience itself [00:11:27, 00:11:53].

### Daily Practice of Leadership
A unique aspect of the program is that a different community member takes charge each day, coached by a staff member [00:11:34]. The individual truly takes responsibility; for example, if the person in charge doesn't wake up, the entire community might miss breakfast, and staff will not intervene, allowing natural consequences to unfold [00:11:42].

## Impact and Context of Leadership
The program's impact on young leaders is profound. It brings together individuals from diverse backgrounds, many with personal experiences of conflict or major global issues [00:12:05]. This diverse environment fosters discussions on how to tackle global challenges, which, for a 15-year-old, can be overwhelming [00:12:13, 00:12:20].

By surrounding themselves with an inspiring group of people who share hopes, dreams, and ambitions, participants are empowered to return home and engage in change within their own communities [00:12:36]. The program fosters long-lasting connections, creating a network of alumni who can support and inspire each other, even working on projects together [00:13:01, 00:13:17].

## Speaker's Personal Transformation
The speaker describes the program as having "ruined" them in a positive way [00:01:42]. Prior to the program, the speaker aspired to be an astronaut, wealthy, and own a large house [00:01:47]. After the program, the speaker now works for an international medical relief charity, valuing richness in life experiences over material wealth [00:01:56].

## Communication as a Foundation for Leadership
A key element of the "how" in leadership development is communication [00:06:38]. When young people arrive, their mobile phones are stored away for two months, forcing them to focus inwards and engage in direct communication [00:07:07, 00:07:20].

A program called "Wisdom Circles" involves small groups of four or five young people meeting weekly to practice speaking from the heart and challenging each other's ideas [00:07:25, 00:07:42]. For some participants, these are the first opportunities they have had to engage in such deep conversations [00:07:58, 00:08:03]. This communication builds stronger bonds within the community and provides a framework for negotiation, conflict resolution, and addressing community issues [00:08:33].

## Valuing the Individual and Redefining Fairness
Through intense communal living and communication, participants learn to value each member of the community as an individual [00:09:03, 00:09:06]. This understanding allows them to challenge traditional notions of "fairness" [00:09:26].

In a community with mixed needs and abilities, fairness is not about equal distribution, but about understanding that different individuals may require different contributions or different proportions of resources [00:09:37]. This lesson teaches that to whom much is given, perhaps much is expected, especially for young people who already have significant life opportunities [00:10:06].

## Limitations
The speaker acknowledges some limitations of the program:
*   The single-gender groups for seven weeks might not fully replicate real-world communities [00:13:59].
*   There's a risk that the "norming" stage of community development works too well, leading to participants not just acting and interacting similarly, but also thinking in the same way [00:14:32].

Despite these, the program offers a valuable "taste of what a community could be" [00:14:11].

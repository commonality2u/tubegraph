The Lilliput 7-inch LCD field monitor is a portable display designed for viewing camera output, particularly useful for outdoor shoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## Features and Design
This "cracking little thing" features a design that opens out and includes a case that can be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. It is powered via a connection at the back of the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

## Connecting to a GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition
To connect the Lilliput monitor to a [[integrating_gopro_hero_3_with_external_monitors | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]], a special Micro HDMI cable is required for the GoPro's output port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. The cable is then plugged into the HDMI input on the back of the Lilliput monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Display
Upon connecting the [[integrating_gopro_hero_3_with_external_monitors | GoPro Hero 3]] and turning on the monitor, the device automatically detects the signal, displaying "HDMI" in the top corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. The monitor successfully displays the camera's feed without needing to adjust specific settings on the monitor itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

However, the initial display includes on-screen information from the GoPro, such as "Protune" in the top left corner, video resolution (e.g., 1080 25), battery status, and Wi-Fi status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. When navigating the GoPro's menu, these setup prompts and settings also appear on the HDMI screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Further exploration is needed to determine if these on-screen displays can be turned off via the GoPro's HDMI monitor settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

Despite the on-screen overlays, the [[integrating_gopro_hero_3_with_external_monitors | HDMI out from the GoPro Hero 3 through the Lilliput field monitor works]] "really sweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

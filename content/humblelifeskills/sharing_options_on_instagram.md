Instagram provides various sharing options for its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These options include sharing to platforms like Twitter and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, as well as an email sharing feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. If the email option isn't immediately visible, users can select a "show more" option to reveal additional choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Configuring Email Sharing

To send a photo via email on Instagram, users need to configure the email sharing option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This involves adding a new email address to the sharing settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Once an email address is added and confirmed with a green tick, it becomes an available sharing destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Sending Photos to a Kodak Pulse Photo Frame

An interesting application of Instagram's email sharing feature is to send photos to a Kodak Pulse photo frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. By emailing photos directly from Instagram, users can have their images cycle through on the frame without manually browsing Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This allows others to receive a "snippet of your life" directly on the photo frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

To utilize this for a Kodak Pulse photo frame, the email address to use is `Instagram@Kodakps.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. When sharing, Instagram can send a copy of the picture to this address, alongside other platforms like Flickr or Tumblr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

> When [[using_instagram_to_send_photos_via_email | using Instagram to send photos via email]], ensure the correct email address `Instagram@Kodakps` is added for the Kodak Pulse photo frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The process of digitally signing multiple documents using the [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | Estonian e-residency]] system involves a specific application and file format. This capability allows users to sign documents in bulk, similar to signing in person, leveraging the encryption of the [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | Estonian digital ID card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Software and File Format

The primary application used for this process is called [[digidoc3_application_for_document_signing | DigiDoc3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. When documents are signed, they are saved in a format called [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] format is the default [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digital signature]] format in [[estonias_digital_id_system | Estonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It functions similarly to a zip file, containing the signed documents within it, especially when signing multiple documents in a batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Steps for Batch Signing

1.  **Launch the Application**: Open the [[digidoc3_application_for_document_signing | DigiDoc3 application]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.
2.  **Load Documents**: Documents can be loaded in `docx` format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The application supports loading multiple documents for bulk signing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
3.  **Specify Output Folder**: The application prompts the user to select an output folder where the signed documents will be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
4.  **PIN 1 for Authentication**: To proceed with the [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digital signature]] process, PIN 1 is required for digital authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
5.  **Review and Sign**: After entering PIN 1, the user can review the documents to be signed. Fields within the signing interface are optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
6.  **PIN 2 for Signing**: To finalize the [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digital signature]], PIN 2 is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Once entered, the application processes the signing of all selected documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
7.  **Confirmation**: Upon completion, the application confirms that the documents were signed and indicates their validity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. For batch signing, all documents are typically consolidated into a single [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Usage Limitations

The system allows for a maximum of 10 [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digital signatures]] per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Ease of Use

The overall process of digitally signing documents using the [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | Estonian e-residency]] system is straightforward and considered very easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Comparison with other devices

Compared to a Blue Snowball microphone, the "my port Pro" offers more adjustments, including distinct microphone and headphone level controls, which the Blue Snowball lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The Blue Snowball also had a "really, really blue" and less desirable light indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Usage

The "my port Pro" can be connected to a laptop to record directly into the computer, delivering broadcast-quality sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. An example of a compatible microphone is the Rode NTG2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

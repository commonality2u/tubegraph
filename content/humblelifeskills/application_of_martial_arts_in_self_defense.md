## Key Self-Defense Techniques

[[introduction_to_max_self_defense | Max self-defense]] teaches practical techniques for conflict situations:

*   **The Fence**
    This technique involves stepping back and maintaining distance, using a "fence" posture to keep an aggressor at bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. If an attack occurs, this position allows for a quick cover and counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

*   **The Pleading**
    This approach involves making the aggressor believe they are in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. When grabbed, the individual puts their hands up to protect their face, pleading and not appearing to be on the attack, before executing a counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Benefits of Training

[[introduction_to_max_self_defense | Max self-defense]] training is described as "team building with a purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Unlike activities such as paintballing or quad biking, it ensures genuine [[team_building_through_self_defense | team bonding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The program aims to bring out the best in people, fostering a great deal of confidence and preparing individuals for conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It is likened to first aid: something you hope you don't need, but is available as a reserve if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

ScreenFlow offers powerful templating capabilities that can significantly speed up video production by automating elements such as intro animations, crossfades, intro/outro audio, and green-screen effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## How ScreenFlow Templates Work

Instead of simply recording the screen, microphone, and camera, you can select a pre-made template as the base for your recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. When a template is used, ScreenFlow understands its structure, automatically arranging the recorded elements (screen, camera, mic) into the file in a predetermined way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This allows for pre-formatting the look of the video, greatly improving productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

A template file will display "template" next to the file name, for example, "one ramp - frog ScreenFlow template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### [[screenflow_template_configuration_and_structure | Template Placeholder Clips]]

In ScreenFlow 8.22, the "Insert" tab allows you to add template placeholder clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. These placeholders represent the inputs that will be recorded, such as:
*   Screen recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   Computer audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   Microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   iOS devices (if plugged in via USB, enabling screen recording from a phone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>

## Customizing Templates for Automation

Templates allow for complex layering and pre-applied effects, which are then automatically applied to your recorded content.

### Borders

You can create borders around your video, placing them on their own nested layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These borders (left, right, bottom, top) can be individually customized for color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> and duration (e.g., set to 5 minutes to cover most recording lengths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. These intro borders can be set to disappear after a specific time, like two seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Intro Logo and Text

An intro can be set up as a group of layers, including top text, bottom text, an image, and an annotation (like a black background with adjusted opacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Effects such as a drop shadow can be applied to text within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### [[enhancing_audio_with_screenflow | Audio Processing]]

A powerful feature is the ability to extract audio from the camera and microphone placeholder onto a separate layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This allows for pre-processing of audio before recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. For example, you can apply an [[enhancing_audio_with_screenflow | audio filter]] to that layer, such as an "Apple effects batch" preset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This preset can include settings for compression, master gain, release time, and limiter, ensuring the audio sound is refined immediately after recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### [[creating_animations_and_effects_in_screenflow | Creating Animations and Effects]]

Templates can incorporate complex animations and movements for video elements:
*   **Camera Movement:** The webcam image can be set to move across the screen (e.g., from left to right during an intro to avoid overlapping text) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. After the intro, it can be moved back to the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Actions:** By selecting a layer and clicking the "action" button, you can add a new layer that defines specific actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. These actions can be time-sensitive and include moving, enlarging, rotating, or cropping elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **[[creating_animations_and_effects_in_screenflow | Style Presets]]:** Once a set of effects is found, they can be saved as [[creating_animations_and_effects_in_screenflow | style presets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. For instance, a preset can be created to position the webcam in the bottom left corner and scale it down, with the animation automatically transitioning the image from its initial size to the new scaled position over a defined duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Backgrounds and Screen Recordings

Templates allow for layering multiple video elements, such as a video file playing in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, with a screen recording and computer audio placeholder at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This means you can seamlessly transition between speaking on camera (e.g., with a green screen) and jumping to your desktop screen recording during the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

By using these powerful [[using_screenflow_templates_for_video_production | templating]] capabilities, video production for platforms like DTube or YouTube can be significantly accelerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

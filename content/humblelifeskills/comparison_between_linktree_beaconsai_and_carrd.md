A bio link page serves as a central portal for a single URL found in social media bios (e.g., Twitter, TikTok, Instagram) that directs users to a page containing multiple links [00:00:05]. This concept was likely inspired by link pages used by musicians to direct fans to various platforms like Deezer and iTunes [00:00:23].

## Traditional Link Page Solutions

Initially, users often turn to dedicated services for creating these link pages [00:00:40].

### Linktree

[[Simplified web page building with Carrd | Linktree]] is a widely used platform for creating simple link pages [00:00:40]. It was a common starting point for many users [00:00:43].

### Beacons.ai

Beacons.ai was adopted by some users seeking a more powerful solution than Linktree [00:00:46]. However, it encountered issues, including its link being blocked on TikTok [00:00:53] and a subsequent link change [00:00:57]. A significant drawback of Beacons.ai is its pricing structure, costing $10 per month, which amounts to $120 per year for a simple portal page [00:01:02].

## Carrd as a Cost-Effective Alternative

For those already using various web applications, Carrd presents an alternative for creating personalized link pages [00:01:13].

### Creating a Bio Link Page with Carrd

A bio page created with Carrd maintains a good appearance on mobile devices [00:01:25]. The process for [[creating_a_custom_link_page_using_carrd | building a custom link page on Carrd]] is straightforward: it involves a simple layout with a container that holds a "buttons table," allowing for quick addition and modification of links [00:01:51]. This method offers a similar, simplistic approach to builders like Beacons.ai and Linktree [00:02:09].

### Cost-Effectiveness of Carrd

[[Costeffectiveness of using Carrd for link pages | Carrd]] offers a significantly more affordable pricing model compared to platforms like Beacons.ai [00:01:45]. A setup on Carrd can cost as little as $9 per year [00:01:28]. For $19 per year, users can create up to 10 sites [00:01:31], meaning one could build a professional bio page and nine additional similar pages for friends or other projects [00:01:37]. This annual cost for 10 sites is still substantially cheaper than using Beacons.ai [00:01:45]. Carrd also includes various add-on elements [00:02:35]. The ability to create multiple distinct bio pages for different platforms (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) at a lower cost makes Carrd a versatile option [00:02:40]. Examples of Carrd themes can be seen at `ihas.com` [00:02:19].

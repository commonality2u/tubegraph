## Device Connectivity

The iRig Mic HD connects via a micro USB port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. It comes with two cables:
*   Micro USB to Lightning cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This is noted as an important inclusion, as many older audio recording devices use a different connector for iPads and iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
*   Another cable is also included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

The cable connects securely to the bottom of the microphone, where it can be screwed in to prevent easy dislodgement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

## App Functionality

When tested with the Fire audio recording app on an [[device_connectivity_options | iPad]], the iRig Mic HD was detected as "iRig mic HD" with sample rates of 32,000 Hz, 44,000 Hz, and 48,000 Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. It supports stereo recording with mono left, mono right, and mono left and right channel options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. A blue LED on the microphone illuminates when connected and recognized by an app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

While the Fire app recognized the mic, the volume slider in the app was noted to be all the way up, suggesting potential issues with input level control within that specific app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

The iRig Mic HD is intended for use with live streaming apps like Meerkat and Periscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>, as well as audio platforms like Audio Boom and potentially SoundCloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Its design makes it suitable for mobile recording, interviews, and podcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

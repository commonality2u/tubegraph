The internal battery of the [[GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features | GoPro 3 Black Edition]] has been noted for its [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | unreliability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Users report inconsistent battery life, ranging from half an hour to an hour and a half, rather than the expected two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. A significant concern is that the battery often gets extremely hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, leading to [[overheating_problems_with_gopro_cameras | overheating problems]] and camera lock-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

This [[overheating_problems_with_gopro_cameras | overheating issue]] raises questions about the camera's performance in [[gopro_usage_in_various_environments_and_conditions | hotter usage conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, contrasting with the perceived original use cases in cold environments like surfing or snowboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. [[User experiences with GoPro Hero 3 Plus batteries | Owners of the GoPro Hero 3 Plus Edition]] are invited to share if battery reliability has improved in that model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## External Battery and Power Solutions

One alternative discovered is the Wasabi power GoPro 3 battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, which is a tiny replacement battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. A specific Wasabi power battery has specifications of 3.7 volts, 1200 milliamps, and 4.4 watt-hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The speaker intends to test this replacement battery to determine if the issue is with the battery itself or a broader camera fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

A more robust solution for mitigating [[overheating_problems_with_gopro_cameras | overheating]] and battery life issues is the availability of an external power pack. For approximately $60, a pack can be obtained that connects to the GoPro Hero, allowing it to run from main power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This eliminates internal battery [[overheating_problems_with_gopro_cameras | overheating]] and charging concerns, as the battery is not inside the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Using external power can provide better uptime and prevent the camera from locking up due to heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Usage in Production

For [[filming_techniques_with_gopro | specific filming scenarios]], such as use in a green screen shower, the GoPro's wide-angle shot is desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The ability to adjust to medium or narrow angles, and even macro or super wide shots, makes it a versatile tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, the unreliability of the internal batteries, particularly their tendency to [[overheating_problems_with_gopro_cameras | overheat]] and lock up, makes it difficult to rely on for consistent capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Attempts have been made to [[integrating_gopro_hero_3_with_external_monitors | integrate the GoPro]] with external capture devices like the [[using_gopro_with_blackmagic_intensity_extreme | Blackmagic Intensity Extreme]] via HDMI in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This setup, however, highlights potential color differences compared to direct raw editing or other cameras like the Logitech C920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Users with [[GoPro Hero 3 battery reliability issues | GoPro 3 Black Edition battery issues]] are encouraged to share their experiences and solutions, especially regarding [[overheating_problems_with_gopro_cameras | overheating]] and overall reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. While the latest firmware is often installed, the persistent battery issues can still prevent reliable use of the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

The idea of setting up a [[building_a_raspberry_pi_cluster_for_various_functions | Raspberry Pi]] for a Minecraft server emerged as a cost-effective solution for a child interested in playing the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While a laptop running a full version of Minecraft might cost a couple of hundred pounds, utilizing a Raspberry Pi offered a cheaper alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Hardware and Setup
The plan involves using an older Raspberry Pi model that became spare after the purchase of a newer, faster Raspberry Pi 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Instructions for setting up Minecraft on a Raspberry Pi appear to be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The Raspberry Pi itself is a compact computer often described as a "computer in a box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, making it suitable for a media player or other functions for around 30-35 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Function within a Cluster Concept
While initially for a single-use setup, the Minecraft server function is also considered as a potential "slice" within a larger [[building_a_raspberry_pi_cluster_for_various_functions | Raspberry Pi cluster]] project, where each Pi performs a distinct task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. For events or educational purposes like Coda Dojo, a single box could house multiple Raspberry Pis, each with a specific SD card for functions like Minecraft, effectively creating a 10-user machine in a small, portable enclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

This project ultimately aims to provide a dedicated Minecraft server for a child by repurposing existing or newly acquired Raspberry Pi hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

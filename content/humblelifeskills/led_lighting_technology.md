One notable piece of kit currently favored is the [[lp_micro_light_panel_features | LP Micro from Light Panels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This device is an LED-enabled light panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, showcasing modern portable lighting solutions.

## Key Features of the LP Micro Light Panel

The [[lp_micro_light_panel_features | LP Micro light panel]] comes with several practical features:
*   **Attachment**: It includes a standard hot shoe attachment on the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Adjustability**: The panel pivots backwards and forwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Power**: It operates on four batteries, and rechargeable ones can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It supports 5 to 12 volts DC input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Control**: A simple dial wheel on the top allows users to turn it on and gradually bring the LEDs to the desired brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Power output can be adjusted to suit specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Battery Life**: The device typically lasts for about 3 or 4 hours on a charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Light Quality**: The LEDs are 5,300 Kelvin Daylight bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Benefits and Applications

The [[benefits_of_led_lighting_for_cameras | benefits of LED lighting for cameras]] like the LP Micro are particularly evident in challenging environments:
*   **Low Light Conditions**: When used with a camera or video camera at night, in a club, bar, or any very dark situation, it provides just enough light to enhance the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Visual Enhancement**: It creates a "really nice glow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> and significantly adds to video detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Addressing Camera Limitations**: Many cameras, including the Flip and those with CMOS sensors, often suffer from [[challenges_with_low_light_conditions_in_cameras | poor low light performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Portable LED panels like the LP Micro help mitigate these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Pricing and Value

The [[pricing_and_value_of_lp_micro_light_panel | LP Micro from Light Panels]] retails for approximately Â£120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It is considered to be "worth every penny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, indicating its value as a [[tech_gadget_recommendations | recommended tech gadget]].

## Future Considerations

While the current LP Micro is highly regarded, there is a desire for a smaller version, possibly half the size, with a clip mechanism to attach to devices like the Flip camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The author is saving up for Ultimate Ears headphones but does not use headphones for a long enough duration to justify the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Instead of Ultimate Ears, the author currently uses Sennheiser CX 380 sport headphones, which are noted for being very light and having good sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These Sennheiser headphones are yellow, which is helpful for visibility, especially when traveling or leaving them out on a table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, their yellow color can make them hard to find if placed inside a guitar bag that is also orangey-yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. To avoid misplacing them, the author keeps them in their provided plastic case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

A general [[durability_concerns_with_sport_headphones | durability concern]] is mentioned, as every pair of headphones the author has ever bought has eventually broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

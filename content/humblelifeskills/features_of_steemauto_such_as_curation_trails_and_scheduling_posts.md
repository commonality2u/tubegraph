Steemauto.com is an automation tool designed for Steemit users, offering features for managing upvotes and rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It emerged as an alternative when [[differences_between_steemvoter_and_steemauto | Steemvoter]] experienced downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Secure Login with Steam Connect

Initially, the login process for Steemauto seemed uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, as it didn't immediately present a Steam Connect option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Steam Connect is a secure service, similar to Facebook Connect, that allows users to log in securely to various APIs on the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Users must first register, which then provides the choice to use Steemauto's login/password or Steam Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Using Steam Connect securely links all Steemit details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The service is considered safe to use, with its development reportedly influenced by user suggestions for Steam Connect integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Key Features

Steemauto offers several features that enhance the Steemit experience:

### Fan Base

Similar to [[differences_between_steemvoter_and_steemauto | Steemvoter]], Steemauto includes a "fan base" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This allows users to add individuals and set rules for automatic upvotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Rules can specify the upvote weight (0-100%) and the delay time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This is useful for consistently upvoting people who comment, reply, or individuals met in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Users can also see a list of "top fans" within Steemauto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. For redundancy, users can copy their [[setting_up_auto_vote_rules_on_steemit | auto vote rules]] to a notepad in case a service goes down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Curation Trails

A notable feature of Steemauto is curation trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Users can follow a curation trail, which means automatically upvoting posts that a specific trail or account upvotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This is beneficial for users who want to support a project, or when they are unable to actively curate, such as when on holiday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Users can set a weight limit for their upvotes on these trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Additionally, users can choose to become their own curation trail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Scheduled Posts

Steemauto allows users to schedule posts for future publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Users can set the number of hours from the current time for the post to be published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This feature is useful as Steemit itself does not have a native scheduling function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Users can draft a post first to ensure formatting is correct, then use the scheduler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Upvote Comments

The platform provides the ability to automatically upvote comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This feature typically waits a set time (e.g., 15 minutes) before applying a specified upvote weight (e.g., 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. It ensures each user receives one upvote per post and a maximum of two upvotes per day, even if they make multiple comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This encourages regular commenters on a blog by providing them with remuneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Claim Rewards

Steemauto includes a convenient "claim rewards" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. By enabling this, Steemauto checks a user's account every 30 minutes to automatically claim benefits from the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This streamlines the process, moving funds to the user's SPD line and the rest to their Steem Power balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

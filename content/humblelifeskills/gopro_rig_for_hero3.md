## Rig Features and Design

The rig is notable for being [[3d_printed_camera_rig | 3D printed]], made up of layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Its design includes:

*   A mounting point at the bottom where the standard [[GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features | GoPro]] mount clips in, allowing the camera to be screwed into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   The presenter noted that while the [[GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features | GoPro]] can be mounted out of its case, it might require a separate frame adapter for proper mounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

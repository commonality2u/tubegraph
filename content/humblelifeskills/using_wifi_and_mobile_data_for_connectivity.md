This article details the use of different connectivity methods, specifically WiFi and mobile data (3G/Edge), in the context of running the Agile Messenger application on a Nokia N80 phone.

## Connectivity Options

The Nokia N80 is a WiFi-capable phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. When using Agile Messenger, the preferred internet access point is typically a home WiFi network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

However, if WiFi signal strength is an issue due to distance from the wireless router (e.g., the router being two floors down from the user's location), mobile data can be used as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This highlights a common challenge in [[extending_wifi_range | extending WiFi range]] for consistent connectivity.

### Mobile Data Usage

When connecting via mobile data, such as through Orange internet, the process can take longer due to network negotiation, especially on 3G connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The type of mobile data connection (e.g., Edge vs. 3G) can affect performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

A key benefit of Agile Messenger is its low [[mobile_data_usage_and_costs | mobile data usage and costs]] when running in the background and not actively sending messages, making it efficient for those on data tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Agile Messenger Application

Agile Messenger is a chatting program recommended for mobile devices due to its ability to connect to multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

#### Supported Networks

The application can connect to various popular messaging services, including:
*   ICQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   AOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Yahoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   MSN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

#### Features and Functionality

When running on the Nokia N80 (Symbian S60), Agile Messenger offers several features:
*   **Multi-network connectivity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Integration with phone features:** The application can utilize the phone's capabilities, such as sending messages to a Twitter feed via the chat client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Image sending:** Users can take a photo directly with the phone's camera and send it to a contact via the client as a file transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Background operation:** The service can be hidden and run in the background, loading quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Autoconnect on start:** An option allows the application to automatically connect to all configured chat clients when the phone is turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

#### Compatibility Issues

While working effectively on the Nokia N80 (Symbian S60) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, Agile Messenger has been observed to cause issues, or "knack up," devices running Windows Mobile 5, specifically the "Dash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Users are advised not to install it on such devices until a fix is released for Windows Mobile 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Using a [[setting_up_and_using_a_usb_turntable | USB turntable]] presents several considerations, particularly when dealing with older record formats or initial setup.

## Initial Conversion Needs
One primary reason for acquiring a [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] is to convert specific record types that older equipment may not support. For instance, a client's collection of 500 thick 78 RPM records required a dedicated solution, as previous setups lacked a means of converting them easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Software and Connectivity
A common challenge is the lack of a traditional record player or output for recording audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntables]] address this by working with both PC and Mac, connecting directly via a USB cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. They typically come bundled with software, such as "Odyssey," a free wave program available for both operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This software also allows for previewing the audio before recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] also includes a line out and RCA inputs, enabling the recording of other audio sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Playback Speed Discrepancies
When playing standard 33 RPM records, the audio might sound slightly too slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This can be corrected using the included software, which allows for speeding up the audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. However, finding the optimal setting may require some trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Physical Setup and Skipping Issues
One crucial aspect of [[setting_up_and_using_a_usb_turntable | USB turntable]] setup is ensuring all components are properly installed. A common oversight can be nearly discarding essential parts like the counterweight and needle, which might be hidden within the packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Counterweight Importance
A frequent issue, especially during initial use, is the record player skipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This is often due to the counterweight not being attached, resulting in insufficient force on the needle to keep it seated in the groove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Ensuring the counterweight is correctly positioned is vital for stable playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Specialized Heads for 78 RPM Records
While the [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] can convert [[converting_78_rpm_records_with_usb_turntable | 78 RPM records]], it may not always come with the appropriate [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | head]] from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Different [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | heads]] are available for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. A dedicated [[converting_78_rpm_records_to_digital_format | 78 RPM head]] is often recommended, as the needle for these older, thicker records with more defined grooves may need to be thicker to ensure proper playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. These specialized [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | heads]] typically cost around Â£15 in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

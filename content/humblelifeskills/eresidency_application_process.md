The process of obtaining an [[what_is_eresidency | e-residency]] digital ID card involves several steps, from application to collection, typically completed within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Application and Initial Confirmation

An application for an [[what_is_eresidency | e-residency]] card was submitted on January 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This date coincided with the very last day of the €50 application fee; the price subsequently increased to €100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Immediately after payment, an email was received confirming the application had been received and that further contact would be made shortly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The expectation, based on prior research, was that the entire process would take approximately one month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## [[collection_process_for_the_eresidency_digital_id_card | Collection of the Digital ID Card]]

To collect the [[process_of_obtaining_an_estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card | digital ID card]], it is necessary to travel to London and pick it up at the Estonian Embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Future Use of [[what_is_eresidency | E-residency]]

Beyond its primary function, there is interest in how [[what_is_eresidency | e-residency]] might evolve as a login partner for online services. For instance, "Teleport" is noted as [[using_eresidency_as_a_login_partner_for_online_services | using e-residency as a login]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This development is seen as "super interesting" given past experiences with other login methods like Facebook Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

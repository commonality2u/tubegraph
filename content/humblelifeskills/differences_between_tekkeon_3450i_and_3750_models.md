The Tekkeon 3450i (or 3450r, which is the model specifically shown) is a 58-watt [[tekkeon_3450i_lithium_polymer_battery_features | lithium polymer battery]] designed for portable power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It features a USB connector, an on/off switch, and dip switch settings that allow users to set different output voltages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The device also includes a small fan at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

In contrast, the Tekkeon 3750 model distinguishes itself by having only USB outputs and an auto-detection feature for connected devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Shared Characteristics

Both models, as part of the Tekkeon line, utilize [[tekkeon_3450i_lithium_polymer_battery_features | lithium polymer battery]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This type of battery is noted for its ability to hold a charge better than many other products in both cold and hot weather, due to its polymer wrapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Common features across the line include:
*   **Charge Indicator** The battery has a button that, when pressed once, displays an indicator of its current charge level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Expandability** An adapter bracket is available that allows for stacking an additional battery underneath, effectively doubling the unit's lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Performance** The battery has demonstrated robust performance in extreme conditions, such as running a CradlePoint PHS300 for a day and a half in boiling hot weather at South by Southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. With conservative use and an additional battery, it could potentially power devices for up to a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The cost of the Tekkeon 3450i is approximately 120 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

This article details recommended settings for various Logitech webcams, including the [[logitech_c920_and_c930e_camera_settings | Logitech C920]], [[logitech_c920_and_c930e_camera_settings | C930e]], and the [[using_logitech_brio_4k_webcam | Brio 4K Logitech]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These settings aim to optimize video quality, particularly focusing on how to manage brightness, contrast, and white balance for a professional appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While webcams may not match the quality of a DSLR, they are capable of doing "the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Obtaining the Webcam Settings Software

The recommended [[software_options_for_logitech_webcams_on_mac | native Logitech software]] is more than adequate for adjusting webcam settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Although it can be difficult to find directly by searching for the [[webcam_settings_app_for_logitech_c920 | C920 software]] download, a direct link is `support.logi.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The software version used for these settings is available by downloading for the [[logitech_c920_and_c930e_camera_settings | C930e]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Lighting Setup

The specific webcam settings are based on a setup utilizing [[optimal_lighting_settings_for_webcam_setups | two LED lights]] positioned approximately half a meter from the user's face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. These lights are set to "daylight mode," which corresponds to 5600 Kelvins, adjustable via electronic controls on the lights themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Recommended Webcam Settings

The following settings are applied within the Logitech webcam software:

### General Settings
*   **Image Format:** Widescreen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   **Anti-Flicker:** PAL 50 hertz (for Europe; 60 hertz is typical for the US, related to power and lighting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   **HDR:** On (though it "doesn't seem to make that much impact" and can be turned off if not bothered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   **Field of View:** 78 degrees (a closer shot; 90 degrees offers a wider view) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

### Advanced Settings
These adjustments are crucial for achieving optimal image quality:

*   **Brightness:** 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. It's advised not to set brightness too high, as it can "wash the image out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   [[color_balancing_and_gamma_settings_in_video_capture | Color Intensity]]: 38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   [[color_balancing_and_gamma_settings_in_video_capture | Contrast]]: 45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

### White Balance and Autofocus
*   **White Balance:** [[manual_focus_and_settings_adjustment_for_webcams | Auto white balance]] should be turned *off* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Auto white balance can cause drastic and undesirable color shifts, making the image look "washed out" or have incorrect color tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Manually set it as close to 5600 Kelvin as possible (in the app, this often appears as 5592 due to limitations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Autofocus:** The tracking on these webcams is not as advanced as a [[comparison_of_gopro_with_other_webcams | DSLR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It's recommended to enable autofocus to focus on the subject before recording, then turn it off if the user plans to remain relatively still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. If significant movement is expected, keeping autofocus on is advisable, though it might lead to some "weird" tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## General Tips for Optimal Appearance

The speaker's settings are designed to achieve the [[techniques_to_improve_web_video_chat_quality | best tones for their face and skin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Users may need to experiment with the [[color_balancing_and_gamma_settings_in_video_capture | color intensities]], [[color_balancing_and_gamma_settings_in_video_capture | contrast]], and [[color_balancing_and_gamma_settings_in_video_capture | brightness]] to find what works best for their specific environment and appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. It is highly recommended to review recorded footage on a "decent monitor" or a retina monitor to accurately assess color likeness and make adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This guide was created to serve as a quick reference for the speaker's own frequently forgotten settings and to assist others in optimizing their webcam video quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Additional equipment contributing to the overall setup includes a green screen, a microphone, and a microphone arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

A USB turntable is designed to facilitate the conversion of old vinyl records, such as 78 RPM discs, into digital formats, often requiring accompanying software to manage the recording and playback settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Bundled Software: Odyssey

The USB turntable typically comes bundled with "Odyssey," a free wave program compatible with both Mac and PC systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This software serves as the primary tool for recording and processing the audio from the turntable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Adjusting Playback Speed

The included software allows users to convert the speed of 78 RPM records, enabling a reduction in playback speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. However, when playing 33 RPM records, they might sound slightly too slow, necessitating the use of the software to speed them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Finding the optimal setting within the software for speed adjustment may require some trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Audio Monitoring and Troubleshooting

The software also provides a preview function, allowing users to listen to the audio coming through the record player before or during recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

It is crucial to correctly set up the turntable's physical components, such as attaching the counterweight and needle, as incorrect setup can lead to playback issues like skipping records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Without the counterweight, there is insufficient force on the needle to keep it stable in the groove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Additional Recording Capabilities

Beyond USB connectivity, the turntable features a line-out and RCA phono/line inputs, enabling the recording of audio from other sources through the same software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

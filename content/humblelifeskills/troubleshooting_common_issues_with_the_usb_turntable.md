When setting up and using a [[setting_up_and_using_a_usb_turntable | USB turntable]], some common issues may arise, particularly concerning playback speed and initial setup components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Playback Speed Discrepancies

One observed issue is that 33 RPM records may sound slightly too slow when played through the USB turntable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

*   **Solution:** The playback speed can be adjusted within the accompanying [[software_compatibility_with_usb_turntable | software]] (such as Audacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It may require some experimentation to find the optimal setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Skipping or Jumping Needle

A significant problem encountered during initial use was the record player's needle skipping or jumping across the record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Initially, this was misattributed to old or scratched records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

*   **Cause:** The primary cause was the omission of the counterweight during setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Without the counterweight, there was insufficient downward force on the [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | needle]], leading to constant jumping and skipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Ensure all components, including the counterweight and [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | needle]], are properly installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. These small but crucial parts, like the counterweight, can sometimes be overlooked and nearly discarded, as they might be tucked away in packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Missing Components and Setup

*   **Counterweight:** The counterweight is essential for proper [[setting_up_and_using_a_usb_turntable | turntable setup]] and needle stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. It is typically found within the product's packaging, sometimes in less obvious locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **78 RPM Heads/Needles:** While the turntable may play various speeds, an alternative head specifically designed for [[converting_78_rpm_records_with_usb_turntable | 78 RPM records]] might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These records are notably thicker with more defined grooves, suggesting a thicker [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | needle]] might be beneficial for optimal playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Different play heads are available for purchase, costing around Â£15 in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Even without a specific 78 RPM head, software adjustments can be made to correct the speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

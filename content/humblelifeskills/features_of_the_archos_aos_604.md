The Archos AOS 604 is a new portable media player introduced by Archos. It represents an upgrade from previous models like the [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | Archos AV500]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Design and Ergonomics
The Archos 604 features a "massive screen" compared to its predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Its controls have been relocated to the right-hand side, making them significantly more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The speaker has been moved from the top to the bottom of the device, allowing for more screen "real estate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The device also appears skinnier than older models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Storage
The Archos 604 is available in a 30GB version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. However, there are [[concerns_about_storage_capacity_in_archos_604 | concerns about storage capacity]] as a 100GB version has not yet been released, with the speaker indicating they will wait for such a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Media Playback and Compatibility
The device supports native playback of DVDs, including MPEG-2 and VOB files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. It is designed to support various other media formats through the ability to plug in codecs, including potential open-source plugins for formats like OGG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Notably, the Archos 604 supports H.264 video playback, indicating it has a "serious hardware engine" for decoding this format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Digital Video Recording (DVR)
The Archos 604 introduces a new DVR station, described as a "beautiful unit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This base unit features multiple inputs on the back, including infrared control, left and right audio input, and left and right composite input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This allows users to connect sources like Sky or TV and record content directly to MP4 format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. While the [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | Archos AV500]] also had DVR capabilities, the 604's DVR station is highlighted as a significant improvement in terms of design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Comparison and Market Positioning
The Archos 604 is seen as a strong contender in the portable media player market, with Archos being a small French company known for producing quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The speaker considers the Archos line to be a better player than the iPod, especially concerning video quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. There is a concern that due to Archos's historical [[compatibility_of_archos_devices_with_windows | Windows-centric design]], Microsoft might acquire them, which would be a "real shame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

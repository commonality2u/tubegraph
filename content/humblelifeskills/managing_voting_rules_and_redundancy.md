Automated voting systems like Steemvoter and Steemauto offer ways to manage interactions and rewards on platforms like Steemit. These tools can help users maintain engagement and financial flow, but it's crucial to understand their functionalities and implement redundancy strategies to mitigate service disruptions.

## Steemvoter: A Reliable Predecessor
Steemvoter is described as a generally reliable system with a standard user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Users can [[setting_up_auto_vote_rules_on_steemit | set up rules]] by specifying vote power, vote delay, and the target individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The system allows for a personalized list of people, including those who comment, reply, or have been met in person, to provide an "upswing" from delegated Steem Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Impact of Downtime
When Steemvoter experienced downtime, it directly affected payouts and the ability to see who had voted on posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This feature was also used as a reminder to visit other users' blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The disruption of such automated systems can lead to feelings of anxiety, similar to real-world financial service interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Steemauto: An Alternative with Enhanced Features
Steemauto emerged as an alternative when Steemvoter was unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Its login process initially raised concerns because it didn't immediately appear to use Steam Connect, a secure service for logging into Steemit APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, upon registration, users are given the option to use Steam Connect, which securely links Steemit details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Steemauto is considered safe to use as it's endorsed by trusted users like Crypto Octopus and the developer "mahdir" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Key [[features_of_steemauto_such_as_curation_trails_and_scheduling_posts | Features of Steemauto]]

> "I wanted to highlight a few areas that I think are really kind of much better than Steam vote or at least I haven't really dug interesting voters and see if they've got similar services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

While Steemvoter and Steemauto share features like adding accounts and setting fan base rules, Steemauto offers several distinct advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>:

*   **Fan Base Voting:** Similar to Steemvoter, users can add individuals, specify an upvote weight (0-100%), and set a delay time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Steemauto also lists "top fans" within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Curation Trails:** Steemauto allows users to follow "curation trails," automatically upvoting posts that designated accounts or projects curate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This is useful for maintaining activity, especially during absences like holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Users can set a weight limit to control delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Users can also become their own curation trail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Scheduled Posts:** A unique feature allowing users to schedule posts for future publication by specifying the number of hours from the current time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This addresses the lack of a native scheduling feature on Steemit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Upvoting Comments:** Users can set up automatic upvotes for comments on their blog, specifying a delay and weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This feature can incentivize regular commenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Claim Rewards:** Steemauto can automatically claim rewards from the blockchain by checking the account every 30 minutes, transferring funds to the Steem Power Dollars (SPD) line and Steem Power balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Redundancy for Voting Rules
The disappearance of Steemvoter highlighted the importance of redundancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. It is advisable to copy voting rules to a separate document, like Notepad, to have a backup in case a service goes down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Having rules duplicated across different services, like Steemvoter and Steemauto, with one set active and the other deactivated, provides a fallback option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This proactive approach helps mitigate the "paranoid" feeling that can arise when automated services cease to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

The speaker was fortunate to use it with their daughter and mother, having a good [[pizza_making_experience | pizza making experience]] making pizza dough and toppings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is referred to as an "amazing little oven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

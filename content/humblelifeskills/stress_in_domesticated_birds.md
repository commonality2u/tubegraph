Domesticated birds can experience significant [[information_overload_and_mental_health | stress]], particularly following a physical [[bird_attacks | attack]] or injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Signs of Stress and Injury
A bird subjected to an [[bird_attacks | attack]] by another animal, such as a [[bird_safety_from_predators | crow]], can be left in a highly vulnerable and [[dealing_with_bird_trauma | traumatized]] state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Signs observed in such a bird include:
*   Extreme fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Visible injuries, such as being "absolutely [[injured_birds_and_first_aid | mutilated]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Active [[injured_birds_and_first_aid | bleeding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Loss of feathers or flesh, appearing to have parts "[[injured_birds_and_first_aid | ripped out]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Exhibiting signs of pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Potential Outcomes of Trauma
The [[information_overload_and_mental_health | stress]] and [[dealing_with_bird_trauma | trauma]] experienced by a bird from an [[bird_attacks | attack]] can be severe. There is a concern that such [[dealing_with_bird_trauma | trauma]] could lead to the bird's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The extent to which a bird is affected by [[information_overload_and_mental_health | stress]] is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

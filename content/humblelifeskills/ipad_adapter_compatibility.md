## iClip Microphone Standard Adapter

The iClip microphone standard adapter has been released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This adapter is compatible with the [[device_connectivity_options | iPad]] 1 and [[device_connectivity_options | iPad]] 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Before attaching the adapter, the [[device_connectivity_options | iPad]] must be removed from its [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | protective case]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Functionality

The adapter allows the [[device_connectivity_options | iPad]] to be positioned close to a lens, enabling its use as a teleprompter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Notes created in Pages can be used with this setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Pages' [[compatibility_with_apps_and_devices | compatibility]] with iCloud allows users to easily step through notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

A limitation of the iClip adapter is that it cannot be rotated into landscape orientation without unscrewing a bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

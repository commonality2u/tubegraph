The [[elgato_turbo_264_hd_functionality | Elgato Turbo 264 HD]] is a hardware USB stick designed for faster video encoding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is manufactured by Elgato and [[elgato_turbo_264_hd_functionality | accelerates H.264 video encoding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. H.264 is the standard codec used for most web video formats and compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The device typically costs around 80-90 pounds in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> or 80-90 bucks in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Setting up the device is straightforward, taking only about two to three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This involves installing software from a CD, entering serial codes, and connecting the USB stick via an included extender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Benefits and Functionality

The Elgato Turbo 264 HD is particularly useful for [[improving_video_encoding_speed_on_older_macs | older Mac computers]], such as a five or six-year-old Mac Pro, where the internal CPUs might be too old to efficiently encode high-definition video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It provides [[optimizing_video_quality_with_the_elgato_turbo_264_hd | faster encoding]], potentially up to four times faster for HD video, which is beneficial for mobile workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The device contains a small chip that handles the video encoding job, offloading the processing from the computer's CPUs, which prevents the computer from slowing down while other tasks are performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Using with QuickTime

The Elgato Turbo 264 HD integrates directly into video editing software like iMovie '11, which is used for outputting video when a graphics card doesn't support Final Cut X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

To use the device for encoding:
1.  In iMovie '11, users can simply right-click and select "Export using QuickTime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
2.  Within the QuickTime export drop-down menu, an option for "Elgato turbo 264 HD" will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

#### Export Settings

The Elgato Turbo 264 HD offers various settings:
*   **Presets** It comes with preset settings for common devices like iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **HD Encoding** It supports encoding to HD resolutions, including 720p and 1080p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Custom Settings** Users can click on "Options" to access a range of built-in settings or create their own custom settings to tweak audio and video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Direct Upload** The device also allows encoding and direct upload to a YouTube account or an FTP account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for quickly uploading finished edits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Users can configure FTP protocol details for uploading videos to an FTP service that may further encode them to different formats in the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This allows for distribution to multiple services like Blip TV, Wistia, or YouTube simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

When the save button is clicked and the encoding process begins, a red light illuminates on the Elgato USB unit, indicating activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The device is effective for maintaining good video quality during output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

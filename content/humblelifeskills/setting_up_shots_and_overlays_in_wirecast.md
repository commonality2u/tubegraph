Wirecast is a powerful tool for live streaming and video production, offering extensive capabilities for managing shots, adding effects, and integrating various inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. The version discussed is Wirecast 6.0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Wirecast Interface Overview

The main area of Wirecast features different shots located at the bottom of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Managing and Editing Shots

Wirecast allows users to fully customize their video output:
*   **Editing Shots** You can edit individual shots to adjust their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Microphone Control** Adjusting the microphone input for each shot is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Webcam Selection** You can select your desired webcam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Multiple Inputs** The software supports various inputs, including additional HD cameras if the HDV upgrade is licensed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Adding Overlays and Effects

Wirecast's flexibility extends to adding various visual elements:
*   **Twitter Overlays** Integrate Twitter overlays directly into your stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Text Effects** Add custom text effects to your shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Arranging Multiple People** Create segmented boxes to display multiple people simultaneously, such as in an interview setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Graphic Overlays** Place graphic overlays on top of your video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## Integration Example: Outputting to Blab

To get your Wirecast output into Blab, you use the [[setting_up_virtual_camera_out_in_wirecast | virtual camera outs]] feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Once the virtual camera out is active, Wirecast outputs to a virtual camera, which can then be selected as the video input in Blab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This allows for dynamic changes made in Wirecast to appear live on the Blab stream, such as changing shots or adding overlays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Blab

*   **Setting Virtual Input**: The virtual input must be set *before* starting the Blab session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio**: All assets and inputs should be cut down to a 4:3 aspect ratio to fit the Blab display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Versatility and Future Integrations

Wirecast allows for incorporating various assets, including pre-recorded videos and interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. The software's capabilities suggest potential for [[integrating_wirecast_with_other_platforms_like_skype | integrating with other platforms like Skype]] to bring in additional participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

More features are available within Wirecast, and a series of video clips could explore how to maximize its use, particularly when linking with platforms like Blab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

## Licensing

The current Wirecast license is for version 3x, with an HDV upgrade that still functions with version 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Upgrading to a full license for Wirecast 6 is estimated at approximately Â£3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

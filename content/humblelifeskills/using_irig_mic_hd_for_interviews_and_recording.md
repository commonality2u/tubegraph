The [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]] is a portable digital condenser microphone designed for [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | mobile recording]] and interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Its purchase was influenced by seeing Steve Garfield discussing live streaming apps like Meerkat and Periscope at SXSW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

## Key Features and Compatibility
The iRig Mic HD costs approximately 80 UK pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. It is compatible with a wide range of applications, including Vocal Live, [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Recorder]], Amplitude, Easy Voice, and GarageBand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. The microphone supports various platforms:
*   iOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>
*   Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>
*   Windows PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>
*   [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>
*   iPod Touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>
*   iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>

The microphone features a precision multi-colored LED indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> and a gain control dial located on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. A blue LED illuminates when the device is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

## Build Quality and Accessories
The [[unboxing_and_initial_impressions_of_irig_mic_hd | unboxing]] reveals a microphone with a "very nice weight" that feels "very, very solid" and "well made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Its design is reminiscent of a Shure SM58, a well-regarded vocal microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

Included with the iRig Mic HD are:
*   A mic stand attachment designed to screw into the bottom of the device, providing a secure connection for the cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   A small carry bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   A micro USB to Lightning cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   A micro USB to standard USB cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## Practical Application
The microphone is designed to be "easy to use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. During initial testing with the Fire app, the iRig Mic HD was detected as "iRig mic HD" with sample rate options including 32,000 Hz, 44,000 Hz, and 48,000 Hz, and channel options for stereo or mono <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. However, the app's volume slider appeared to be at maximum initially, and the audio input level was very loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

The iRig Mic HD is considered suitable for:
*   Podcasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>
*   Mobile interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>
*   [[broadcast_quality_sound_for_portable_recording | Recording audio on mobile devices]] like iPads or [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>

For [[using_external_microphones_with_iphone | outdoor recording]], it is recommended to use a "fluffy" cover for noise reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

The iRig Mic HD offers more directional audio capture compared to an iPad's internal microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. It is anticipated to be used for interviews at events like Bushcraft 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

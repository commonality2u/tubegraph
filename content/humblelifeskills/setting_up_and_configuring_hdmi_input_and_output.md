This article details the process of using a GoPro Hero 3 with a Blackmagic Intensity Extreme for video capture via HDMI, focusing on the setup, quality adjustments, and software compatibility.

## GoPro Hero 3 Integration

The video demonstrates using a GoPro Hero 3 positioned above a webcam to provide a wide-angle view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The GoPro Hero 3, like other GoPros, features a tiny [[hdmi_output_from_gopro_hero_3 | HDMI output]] port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This tiny HDMI out cable is connected to the HDMI IN port of the Blackmagic Intensity Extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Blackmagic Intensity Extreme

The Blackmagic Design Intensity Extreme is a device used for video capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It is powered by a Thunderbolt connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> and includes a standard HDMI IN port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The device also comes with a breakout cable that supports various connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The Blackmagic Intensity Extreme was noted to be available for sale at approximately 85 GBP plus postage and packaging within the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Video Quality and Adjustments

When the GoPro footage is captured directly, it appears "raw" without any applied effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The raw feed requires "tinkering" to achieve desirable colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Users can adjust settings such as [[color_balancing_and_gamma_settings_in_video_capture | color balance and gamma]] to improve the video output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. After these adjustments, the output quality is considered "pretty good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

A Logitech C920 webcam is mentioned as a comparison point, noted for its good quality relative to other video sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Software Compatibility

The Blackmagic Intensity Extreme is compatible with Blackmagic's own capture and editing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Importantly, it functions as a video input source within Wirecast, where it can be easily selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Settings within the software can be used to scale and adjust gamma, resulting in a good final output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The blockchain company [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]] acquired BitTorrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This acquisition took place after BitTorrent's creator ran out of money or passion, eventually walking away with $126 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. BitTorrent was originally developed from peer-to-peer roots, making its decentralization a logical step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

[[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]] is recognized as a very fast blockchain with high transaction (TX) records, capable of many transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This speed is crucial for scaling with a platform like BitTorrent, which requires handling a large volume of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## BitTorrent Token (BTT)

Following the acquisition, [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]] created a token for BitTorrent called BTT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The aim is to tokenize the world's largest [[decentralized_file_sharing_with_trc_tokens | decentralized file sharing protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. While BitTorrent claims 100 million users, this figure refers to people who have used blockchain technology generally, not necessarily users of the [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]]-integrated BitTorrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The proposition for BTT is to integrate it into the BitTorrent software, offering "slow," "medium," and "fast" lanes for downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Users would be paid in BTT tokens for seeding content, which requires a 24/7 online node to share data packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This mechanism rewards users for providing peerage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

BTT utilizes a [[decentralized_file_sharing_with_trc_tokens | TRC-10 token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]] offers two token types, TRC-10 and TRC-20, similar to Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens, with TRC-20 being fully backward compatible with ERC-20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The TRC-10 token is reportedly easier to integrate for developers, which could be beneficial for monetizing video hosting communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

As of the transcript's date, [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]] was ranked 12th and BTT 64th on CoinMarketCap, higher than [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Steam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Project Atlas

One of the key projects [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]] is pursuing with BitTorrent is called [[project_atlas_and_its_impact_on_internet_traffic | Project Atlas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This initiative aims to establish a method for sharing and exchanging files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. BitTorrent's existing user base, which accounts for 33% of internet traffic, is primarily used for downloading files, often illegally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. [[project_atlas_and_its_impact_on_internet_traffic | Project Atlas]] envisions a future where users can upload video to a cloud, and "miners" (like those checking Bitcoin transactions) get paid in [[decentralized_file_sharing_with_trc_tokens | TRC-10 tokens]] for facilitating transactions on the [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]] blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## DLive Integration

On the last day of 2019, news broke that DLive, a live streaming platform, was acquired by [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. DLive originated on the [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Steam]] blockchain, using it as an experiment for its first year before transitioning to the Lino blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This acquisition is seen as a beneficial partnership because it addresses the significant challenge of video storage costs and the need for numerous nodes, uptime, and space in both centralized and decentralized networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

The strategy involves integrating video storage and potentially live streaming into the BitTorrent client, allowing users to run it in their system tray and contribute to a global peer-to-peer network for video sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. While streaming would likely involve centralized nodes for low latency, the vision is to explore methods for BitTorrent-based streaming where everyone is part of the network, earning tokens for providing data packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This [[integration_of_bittorrent_and_live_streaming_via_dlive | integration of BitTorrent and live streaming via DLive]] could provide an alternative for streamers looking to move away from platforms like Twitch or YouTube and engage with cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Future Prospects

The [[benefits and setup of decentralized video hosting with IPFS | BitTorrent technology]] is considered highly functional, and integrating it with blockchain is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This move positions [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]] and BitTorrent to potentially offer a compelling solution for decentralized video hosting, possibly gaining an advantage over technologies like [[benefits_and_setup_of_decentralized_video_hosting_with_ipfs | IPFS]] if they can effectively combine the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The long-term goal is to foster decentralized peer-to-peer networks, accelerating the shift away from centralized platforms such as YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

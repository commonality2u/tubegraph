This article provides an overview of a USB turntable purchased to convert old 78 RPM records to digital format. It covers its features, components, and initial observations.

## Purpose and Acquisition
The USB turntable was acquired to address a client's need to convert approximately 500 thick, old 78 RPM records, as the user did not possess a record player for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The cost of the turntable was factored into the job, acknowledging that [[converting_78_rpm_records_to_digital_format | recording 400-500 albums]] would be a time-consuming task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Core Features
*   **Compatibility**: The [[usb_turntable_features_and_functionality | USB turntable]] is compatible with both PC and Mac operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Connectivity**: It connects directly to a computer via a USB cable located underneath the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Included Software**: The turntable comes bundled with [[software_compatibility_with_usb_turntable | Audacity]], a free wave program available for Mac or PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Physical Design**:
    *   It is described as a normal-sized deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   The unit is noted as being quite large, with the speaker suggesting it could have been more condensed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Price**: In the UK, the turntable costs approximately £120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Additional Ports**: The unit includes a USB port, a line out, and RCA Phono/Line outputs, allowing for the feeding and recording of other audio sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Components and Accessories
*   **Packaging Goodies**: The turntable was purchased from Firebox, which included sweets in the package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Counterweight and Needle**: The counterweight and needle, essential for proper playback, were initially overlooked and nearly discarded, as they were found on the side of the internal white packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Play Heads**: While the unit did not come with a different head, it is possible to purchase [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | different heads]] for about £15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. A specific [[converting_78_rpm_records_with_usb_turntable | 78 RPM head]] is recommended for old 78 RPM records, possibly due to a thicker needle or more defined grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Belt**: The turntable requires a belt to be put on for operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Observations
*   **Preview Function**: The turntable allows for a preview of the audio coming through the record player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Speed Adjustment**: The [[setting_up_and_using_a_usb_turntable | software]] allows for speed adjustment, enabling the reduction of 78 RPM record speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Playback Speed Issue**: When playing 33 RPM records, they sounded slightly too slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The user noted that while this can be corrected in the software, it would require time to determine the best setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This is a common point in [[troubleshooting_common_issues_with_the_usb_turntable | troubleshooting common issues]].
*   **Skipping Issue**: Initially, the record player kept skipping because the counterweight had not been installed, leading to insufficient force on the needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Once the counterweight was in place, the issue was resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Periscope Producer can be set up using streaming software like OBS Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. OBS Project is a free-to-download software available for both Windows and Mac operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Enhanced Capabilities with Desktop Streaming (via OBS)

Using a desktop streaming solution like OBS with Periscope Producer unlocks a wider range of production possibilities compared to being tied to a mobile smart device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Key benefits include:
*   Ability to incorporate animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Creation and use of [[creating_lower_thirds_in_obs | lower thirds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Integration of playlists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   Support for different inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

This allows for [[creating_regular_shows_with_periscope_from_the_desktop | more elaborate and regular shows]] from the desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

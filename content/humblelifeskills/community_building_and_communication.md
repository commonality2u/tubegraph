The speaker's involvement in the Rising Sun Youth Leadership Program stems from a personal commitment in 2012 to say "yes" to opportunities, which led to an invitation to speak about the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This program, run by the Lewis August Jones Foundation, aims to "create a better world for tomorrow by inspiring young leaders today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The speaker has been involved for seven summers, first as a participant and then as a staff member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## What is Rising Sun?

Rising Sun is an [[importance_of_community_and_giving_back | intentional community]], similar to co-housing models, where a group of people choose to live together, [[Infrastructure and Resource Management in Low Impact Communities | sharing resources]] and responsibilities, and actively pursuing a common vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The program selects bright, motivated young people aged 14 to 16 from various countries worldwide, brings them together in New York for two months over the summer, and separates boys and girls to focus on community building through a carefully designed program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Community Development and Performance

The program's structure aligns with Tuckman's group development model, which outlines four stages for communities:
*   **Forming**: The initial stage of getting to know each other and playing nicely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Storming**: Where members confront differences as they truly get to know one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Norming**: Agreeing on shared values and interaction methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Performing**: A highly functioning group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

The "performing" stage is particularly exciting, as it demonstrates the community's ability to navigate challenges constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Case Study: Trust and Forgiveness

During one summer, a group of 50 teenage girls engaged in a four-hour conversation about a suspected theft from a suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Contrary to staff expectations of seeking consequences, the girls focused on their concern that the incident could threaten their ability to trust each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. They collectively decided to forgive the person responsible, not discuss it again, and consciously commit to doubling their trust in one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This mature response, which went beyond simple solutions, showcased the community's framework for expression and interaction, allowing them to move forward rather than encountering a hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Impact on Alumni

Rising Sun alumni consistently contribute to their local and global communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Examples include:
*   A young person who fundraised to put solar panels on her school roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   An alumnus who released a worldwide film about receding glaciers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Marius, who helped organize a TEDx event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

These achievements are attributed to their Rising Sun experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## The "How": Key Elements of Community Building

The success of the program isn't about the activities themselves (sports, drama, hiking), which are typical of residential summer programs, but rather *how* they are conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Communication
A core aspect is fostering genuine [[social_media_interaction_and_community_engagement | communication]] â€“ speaking, listening, and being heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Upon arrival, participants' mobile phones are locked away for two months, forcing them to focus inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

A key activity is "Wisdom Circles," where small groups of four or five young people weekly discuss questions like "What are your hopes and fears?" or "How have you experienced culture shock?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This practices speaking from the heart, listening, and challenging ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Many young people, despite being digitally connected, have never had such deep conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This communication strengthens community bonds and provides a structure for negotiation, conflict resolution, and collective decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Valuing the Individual and [[Value and Fairness in Communities | Fairness]]
The intense shared living experience teaches participants to [[Value and Fairness in Communities | value each member of the community as an individual]], considering their actions and achievements within their own context, rather than against universal standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This understanding allows them to challenge the notion of "fairness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. In a community with mixed needs and abilities, fairness might mean different contributions or different sized portions of a "cake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. It becomes not just acceptable but expected that "to whom much is given, perhaps much is expected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Servant Leadership
The program fosters servant leadership, which emerges from living intensely together and having to negotiate close proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Leadership is about leading from within the community, meeting its needs before one's own, and realizing it doesn't always mean standing at the front or giving orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. While leadership concepts are openly discussed, the living experience itself teaches the most profound lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Each day, a different member takes charge, and the community's success (e.g., getting breakfast) depends on their initiative, with staff providing coaching but not intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Empowering Change and Support Networks

When young people from diverse backgrounds, many with personal experiences of conflict or global issues, come together, discussing how to tackle global challenges can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. However, being surrounded by inspiring peers with shared hopes and ambitions empowers them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. They prepare together, ready to return home and "step more powerfully into your world, into your community and ready to engage and affect change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

A crucial aspect is the long-lasting support network; alumni are not alone in their [[volunteer_work_and_community_involvement | community involvement]] and change-making efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The program perpetuates this connection by bringing back former students into subsequent years, ensuring a common understanding and deeper level of interaction among alumni, even those who haven't shared the same summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Limitations

The speaker acknowledges potential limitations:
*   **Single-gender groups**: The seven-week duration might not fully test or sustain community dynamics long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Selection process**: Participants are chosen for their leadership potential and receptiveness to the program's ideas, which might lead to the "norming" phase working "too well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Risk of uniform thinking**: There's a risk that moving from similar acting and interacting to thinking in the same way could be a limitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

## A Challenge to Community

The speaker concludes by reflecting on the massive impact Rising Sun has had on their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Drawing on the program's "Council" evening tradition, which emphasizes collective wisdom, the speaker challenges the audience to consider how Rising Sun's ideas could improve "shared coexistence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

The challenge posed to the audience is:
*   Do you communicate with and listen to your community? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>
*   Do you ensure all voices are heard and valued in your immediate community? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>
*   Are you surrounding yourself with people who inspire you to take on local or global community challenges and "be the change that you want to see"? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>

The Fire application is a software designed to work with external microphones, specifically demonstrated with the Blue Mikey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Core Features and Usage

*   **Microphone Detection**: The Fire application is able to detect and utilize external microphones like the Blue Mikey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. When the microphone is plugged in, the app prompts the user to confirm its use for calls and recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. After a few clicks, it fully detects the microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **iPhone Compatibility**: While the Blue Mikey natively works on an iPod Touch without the application, the Fire application is necessary for its proper function on an iPhone 3G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Without the application, plugging the microphone into an iPhone can result in an undesirable noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Recording Capabilities**: The application allows users to record an unlimited number of recordings on the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Offline Operation**: A significant advantage of Fire is its ability to record without requiring an internet connection or broadband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This means interviews or other recordings can be conducted consecutively without concerns about data connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

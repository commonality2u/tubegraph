## About Max Self Defense
Max Self Defense is run by Mark Wingfield and Mark Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. They offer simple and effective [[self_defense_training_in_the_uk_and_europe | self-defense training]] primarily based in the East Midlands, but they are willing to travel across the UK and also provide opportunities in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Approach to Training
The training focuses on the easiest and most [[practical_self_defense_techniques | practical elements of martial arts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The goal is to ensure individuals, their staff, or loved ones can stay safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Key Techniques
Max Self Defense teaches specific techniques to handle potential conflict:

*   **The Fence**
    This technique involves stepping back and maintaining distance from a potential aggressor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. If an attack occurs, the user is positioned to cover and counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    > "Stay back." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

*   **The Pleading**
    This is a deceptive technique where the individual makes the aggressor believe they are in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. It involves raising hands to protect the face and appearing non-aggressive, followed by a counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Benefits of Training
Beyond personal safety, the training offers several advantages:

*   **[[team_building_through_self_defense | Team Building]]**

Activities like hitting bags together help relieve stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. They refer to their offering as "[[team_building_through_self_defense | team building]] with a purpose," suggesting it's more effective for bonding than activities like paintballing or quad biking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

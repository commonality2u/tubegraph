The Lambus project focuses on [[low_impact_development_and_its_goals | low impact development]] (LID) to establish a new direction for rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This approach prioritizes labor and design-intensive systems over fossil fuel-intensive ones to enhance the productivity of rural land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It aims to put people on land they can tend intensively, contrasting with modern farming which is people-scarce and fossil fuel-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The project leverages tools like [[permaculture_and_sustainable_farming_practices | permaculture]] and simple living practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Policy and Location

The project is specifically located in Pembrokeshire, which is currently the only area in Britain with a specific [[low_impact_development_and_its_goals | low impact development]] policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This policy provides a specific framework for projects like Lambus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Obtaining planning permission required significant negotiation with Pembrokeshire County Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Operating under this special policy means the project can develop and live on agricultural land, provided the land is worked for livelihood and all activities are ecologically sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The project hopes similar legislation will soon be in place for Wales and eventually all of Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The land for the project was acquired after putting out a request in Pembrokeshire for landowners willing to sell for such a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The owners of the chosen land have been highly supportive throughout the long process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Site-Specific Natural Resources and [[infrastructure_and_resource_management_in_low_impact_communities | Infrastructure]]

The chosen land has two major assets:
*   **Spring Water** A reliable source of spring water is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Hydroelectric Power Plant** An existing hydroelectric power plant, fed by an old mill leat constructed over 150 years ago, is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This plant requires a small amount of refurbishment and connection to become fully operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

The land is south-facing and considered good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. It is part of a large area of land above 150 meters, typically used for grazing, which has very low productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The project aims to demonstrate that [[low_impact_development_and_its_goals | low impact development]] can be successful not only on prime agricultural land but also on widely available and often unused land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Soil Reconditioning and Productivity Enhancement

Despite having fairly thin topsoil, the project is working to recondition and build more topsoil, bringing land previously only suitable for grazing into a more productive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Sustainable methods for improving soil include:
*   **Removing Overgrazing Animals** Sheep that had constantly overgrazed the land for about 25 years were removed, as modern stocking ratios severely affect the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Planting Trees** Trees are planted to introduce nutrient cycling into the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Introducing Fungi** Soil is seeded with mycorrhizal fungi to assist connections between plants and soil elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Organic Matter Enhancement** Soil is built up using green manures, nitrogen-fixing plants, and the introduction of more organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Composting** Growing and cutting nitrogen-rich shrubs, then adding them back to the soil, and large-scale composting are utilized to build up the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Multifunctional Design and [[permaculture_and_sustainable_farming_practices | Permaculture]] Principles

A core principle of [[permaculture_and_sustainable_farming_practices | permaculture]] design is that every element serves more than one function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. For example, Willow saplings planted on the site serve multiple purposes:
*   **Firewood** They will provide a source of firewood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Windbreak** They create a windbreak, which helps establish a microclimate for growing forest gardens and cereal crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Delineation** They demark the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Craft Wood** They can be used as a craft wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Expenditure Priorities and Philosophy

For the group project, major expenditures have included:
*   **Trackways** Establishing access tracks to the land for vehicles, which also allows movement in winter without getting stuck in mud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Central Utilities** Provision of water and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

For individual families within the project, the main expenditures are their buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. However, costs are kept minimal; a dwelling is expected to cost between £2,000 and £3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

A key theme guiding expenditure is focusing on fundamental needs (e.g., shelter, warmth, dry space) and then satisfying these needs using available on-site resources like wood, clay, and stone, rather than relying on marketplace products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This approach prioritizes buying tools to create things rather than purchasing finished products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The project also engages in significant tool-making on-site, including mallets and a homemade forge for creating and maintaining tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

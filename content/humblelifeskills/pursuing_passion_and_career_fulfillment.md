Living an amazing life may not be what one initially expects, as it often involves being in control and doing what you love, rather than simply relaxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The speaker illustrates this definition by recounting a busy week that included his wife's car accident, the arrival of his new book, publicly launching a new company, baking five pies for Thanksgiving, hosting relatives, and immediately traveling internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. He emphasizes that this was an amazing week because he was in control and doing what he loves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Defining an Amazing Life

The speaker believes that not enough people are doing what they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. While punching a clock or working a 9-to-5 job can be easier, living an amazing life often means thinking about work non-stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. However, this intensity is balanced with [[balancing_work_and_personal_life | unplugging]] and prioritizing family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The speaker highlights his supportive wife and two children as his motivation for working hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. He believes it is essential to lead by example for one's children and family, pursuing the life one wants to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. While there's nothing wrong with a 9-to-5 job if it suits you, slaving away and hating every minute of it can be corrosive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Taking the Leap

In 2006, despite a highly lucrative and secure job at a college, the speaker felt unfulfilled and decided to seek new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Within a day of telling his wife he needed to look for a new job, he secured one by sending a simple email to a friend who was starting a new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This demonstrates how opportunities arise when one works hard and constantly meets new people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

A year later, when his business partnership wasn't working out due to different approaches, he decided to leave the company even as the mortgage industry was collapsing and he was putting a down payment on a new house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. His wife's unwavering support, telling him "You haven't let me down yet, don't start now," provided the necessary pressure and encouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Navigating Doubts and Defining Success

Many people do not realize they have the power to [[living_an_amazing_life | live the life they want to live]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Doubters, including parents, best friends, and partners, may question this path because "the amazing life is not the easy one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

The speaker suggests that one must choose their path and figure out what they want to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. He coined the term "passion hits" for individuals who have found a way to turn what they love into a livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This path is never easy and involves daily encounters with doubters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### The Role of Community and Overcoming Self-Doubt

A powerful aspect of this journey is discovering a community of people who want to help you be happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. The speaker experienced self-doubt while writing his book, questioning his authority to advise others on [[living_an_amazing_life | living a better life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. His editor's advice, to offer his perspective rather than let others charge for "the dream," helped him overcome this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. He also dismisses criticisms of being "privileged," emphasizing his upbringing with a father who worked multiple jobs selling potato chips and cutting down trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### Technology's Dual Impact

Technology can significantly aid in [[living_an_amazing_life | living an amazing life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The speaker has worked from home for six years and ran a marketing agency with a business partner located in a different state, demonstrating the concept of "work shifting" â€“ working from anywhere with an internet connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. He suggests that even in office jobs, tasks that don't require being at a desk can be done remotely, improving sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

However, the speaker also stresses the importance of turning technology off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. To build the desired family and [[importance_of_community_and_giving_back | community]], it's crucial to get outside, do things, and see people in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. While social media is valuable for connections, real-world interactions, such as having coffee or beer with someone, are where "the awesome happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## The Importance of Hard Work and Giving Back

There is no magic formula for [[living_an_amazing_life | living an amazing life]]; it requires a lot of hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

> "Nothing in this world beats hard work. Sure luck is an amazing thing and some people have more benefits than others..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>

A crucial component of this journey is to [[importance_of_community_and_giving_back | give back]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This doesn't just mean donating money, but rather giving your time, experience, and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that it is a "human duty" to give back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

His perspective was profoundly changed after a trip to Ghana with the ONE Campaign, where he witnessed the potential and national pride of students who wanted to stay and improve their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. He encourages everyone to engage in [[volunteer_work_and_community_involvement | volunteer work]], whether it's at a soup kitchen or a coat drive, as it is a crucial part of personal [[search_for_happiness | happiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

Ultimately, by working hard, being good to others, listening, and helping, amazing things will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

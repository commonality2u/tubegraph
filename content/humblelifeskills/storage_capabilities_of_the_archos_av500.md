The Archos AV500 is a portable media device notable for its robust storage capabilities, making it a versatile device for various media and data management tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Hard Drive Capacity
The Archos AV500 typically features a 100 GB hard drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A smaller 30 GB model was also available, retailing for approximately $300-$350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The 100 GB capacity was considered significant, especially when compared to competing devices like the iPod Video, which at the time did not offer a 100 GB hard drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Diverse Storage Applications
The device's large storage capacity supports a wide range of media:
*   **Photos** The Archos AV500 can store hundreds of thousands of photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. It can connect directly to high-definition cameras (8-9 megapixels) via a USB cable to transfer pictures, including large raw files, from the camera's memory card (SD, CompactFlash, Microdrive) directly to its internal storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Music** It has the capacity to store 10,000 music tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Video** The device can hold "loads and loads of video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Specifically, an empty 100 GB hard drive can store 14 hours of real-time direct encoded MP4 video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Digital Video Recording (DVR) Capabilities
A key feature of the Archos AV500 is its integrated [[digital_video_recording_with_the_archos_av500 | Digital Video Recorder (DVR)]] functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Users can plug the device directly into a Sky box (in the UK) or a cable/digital box (in the US) and schedule programs to record onto its hard drive, similar to a VCR but without tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Connectivity and File Management
The Archos AV500 appears as an external USB 2.0 drive (like a caddy) when connected to a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The file system is organized with folders, allowing users to create and store their files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. While there isn't a dedicated sync application, a watched folder program can be used to automatically transfer updates across the USB 2 connection very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

The [[Archos AV500 features and functionality | device's storage capacity]] and its ability to act as a portable DVR and media archive make it highly recommended for video casters and those needing "out of bounds" video capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

The [[international_gathering_of_phil_campbells | International Phil Campbell Convention]] is an event organized by Phil Campbell, a writer based in New York, with the aim of gathering individuals named Phil Campbell from around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The convention is scheduled to be held in June in [[phil_campbell_community | Phil Campbell, Alabama]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Objective

The primary goal of the convention is to "find all the Phil Campbells" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This includes variations of the name such as "Phyllis's, Philipe, Philippa, Phillips," encompassing "every derivation of Phil Campbell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Organizers emphasize that they are very serious about ensuring "no Phil Campbell is Left Behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Collaboration and Invitation

The organizing efforts involve international collaboration, with contributions from a Phil Campbell in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and another in Great Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The organizers are reaching out for public assistance to locate individuals and families who fit the criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They encourage people to:
*   Email Phil Campbells they know and direct them to the "Phil Campbell convention" Facebook page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   Contact Campbell families to inquire if they have a "Phil" in their family who can then look up the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The town of [[phil_campbell_community | Phil Campbell, Alabama]] is reported to be "really excited" about the convention, with "everybody excited" to have a great time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. All individuals are invited, with "the Phil Campbell of the world" being especially encouraged to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The event is sometimes referred to informally as the "Phil Campbell ho down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

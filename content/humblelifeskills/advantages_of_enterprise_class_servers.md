Enterprise class servers are designed for high performance, reliability, and scalability, distinguishing them from standard consumer-grade hardware. A notable example is the [[dell_poweredge_2650_server_features | Dell PowerEdge 2650]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Key Features and Advantages

### Redundancy
Enterprise servers often feature redundant components to ensure continuous operation. For instance, the [[dell_poweredge_2650_server_features | Dell PowerEdge 2650]] can be upgraded to include fall-over power supplies, providing resilience against power failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Performance
These servers are equipped with powerful components to handle demanding workloads:
*   **Processors** Dual Xenon processors contribute to high processing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Networking** They typically include dual [[advantages_of_gigabit_internet_connections | gigabit]] ports for robust network connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Storage** High-performance storage solutions like 36 GB Ultra320 SCSI drives are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Reliability and Build Quality
Enterprise servers are built to be highly reliable and durable:
*   **Construction** They are often described as being in "pristine mint condition" even after use, indicating robust construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Motherboards** Server boards used in these systems are designed for high reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Form Factor
Enterprise servers are commonly designed as [[rackmount_servers_specifications | rackmount]] units, with common sizes like 2U, allowing for efficient use of space in server racks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Investment
While an enterprise class server like the [[dell_poweredge_2650_server_features | Dell PowerEdge 2650]] can [[cost_and_selling_of_used_servers | cost]] around Â£5,000 when brand new, their advanced features and reliability make them a significant investment for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

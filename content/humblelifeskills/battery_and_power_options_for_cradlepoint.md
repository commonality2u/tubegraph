The [[cradlepoint_phs300_features | Cradlepoint PHS300]] is a wireless hotspot router designed to be battery-operated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Internal Battery
The internal battery of the [[cradlepoint_phs300_features | Cradlepoint PHS300]] provides approximately 3 to 4 hours of operation under typical usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### External Power Options
To significantly extend the device's operating time, an external power unit can be connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. For example, connecting a [[Tekkeon 3450i lithium polymer battery features | Tekkeon power unit]] can extend the battery life to up to a day and a half, providing a wireless network for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The [[cradlepoint_phs300_features | Cradlepoint PHS300]] has a DC input port which accepts a 5-volt power supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This allows for [[battery_life_extension_using_additional_components | external power sources]] to be used, effectively acting as a solution for [[charging_devices_on_the_go | charging devices on the go]] or extending their use without access to wall power.

A new camera rig was acquired that is notable for being 3D printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It is designed to work with [[GoPro rig for Hero3 | GoPro]] cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Discovery and Manufacturer

The rig was discovered after watching a video on YouTube by a group called BMS web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. BMS web focuses on aerial technologies, including remote control planes and head-up displays for tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In one of their videos, a child was seen holding the grip with a [[GoPro rig for Hero3 | GoPro]] attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It was later found that BMS web produces these rigs themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Design and Features

The rig is constructed using 3D printing technology, visible through its layered material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Key features include:
*   **Side Grip** A grip on the side facilitates smooth panning shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Top Handle** A handle on the top allows for capturing low-angle shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **GoPro Compatibility** The rig integrates with the standard mount provided in the [[GoPro rig for Hero3 | GoPro]] box, clipping into the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The camera then screws into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Accessory Hooks** Small hooks on each side provide options for carrying the rig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

It is noted that a separate [[GoPro rig for Hero3 | GoPro]] frame might be necessary for mounting the camera when it's out of its standard case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Applications and Portability

This rig is considered ideal for various [[filming_techniques_with_gopro | filming techniques]] due to its compact and durable design:
*   **Portability** It is "ideal for dropping in the bag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **B-Roll** Excellent for sticking in b-roll footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Interviews** With the addition of a frame, it could be suitable for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Fixed Level Shots** Particularly useful for achieving fixed level shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Acquisition and Cost

The rig was shipped from Australia, arriving in approximately one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, demonstrating efficient [[purchasing_and_shipping_camera_accessories | purchasing and shipping]] for the item. It was not prohibitively expensive, costing approximately $30 or $40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Overall Impression

The rig is highly regarded for its construction quality and the potential of 3D printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. It is considered a well-made and exciting example of what 3D printing can achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

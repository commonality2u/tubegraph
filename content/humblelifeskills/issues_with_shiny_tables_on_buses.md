Phil Campbell, @philcampbell on Twitter, highlights a significant issue with the tables on the [[red_arrow_bus_features | Red Arrow]] buses, part of the [[trent_barton_bus_service | Trent Barton]] service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While praising the overall quality of the buses and their Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, he identifies the "far too shiny" tables as a primary problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Problem Description
The tables on the buses are excessively shiny, causing items to slide around freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This issue becomes particularly noticeable when passengers are coming home from a stressful day, experiencing sweat, and their belongings, such as bags, fail to stay in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. As Campbell describes, "it just goes everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Proposed Solution and Demonstration
Campbell proposes a simple and cost-effective [[solution_for_nonslip_surface_on_bus_tables | solution for nonslip surface on bus tables]] using non-slip grip liner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He suggests that a few strips of this material would prevent items from moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

He demonstrates this solution on the bus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>:
*   He places an item on the shiny, unfixed surface, and it immediately slides off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   In contrast, a bottle placed on the non-slip material remains stationary, even when the bus is moving or swinging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Effectiveness
The non-slip material, described as a "one pound wonder" microfiber mat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, effectively prevents items from moving, thereby saving passengers "stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Campbell suggests that the material simply needs to be "stitched into the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> for a permanent fix.

## Motivation for Volunteering

Individuals are often driven to [[volunteer_work_and_community_involvement | volunteer]] to help those experiencing homelessness out of a deep personal conviction. One volunteer, who started in January after being asked by their church, felt it was in their heart for many years to help people, especially in their own country of Albania, but now also in the local community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Another volunteer, Dean Wyman, started volunteering in early November and felt a strong need to communicate with homeless individuals, to show them that someone cared, and to actively help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Godfrey Payne also became involved after a request from church leaders to help at Derby Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Volunteers have expressed amazement and shock at the scale of the [[challenges_faced_by_the_homeless_in_accessing_housing | homelessness problem]] in their town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Volunteer Activities and Commitments

Volunteers demonstrate significant commitment to supporting homeless individuals:
*   One volunteer has been coming to the center nearly every day since January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   They spend two hours in the morning, having breakfast together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   During these times, homeless individuals share various issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   The same volunteer also stays two nights a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   The church has been willing to open its premises, allowing [[volunteer_work_and_community_involvement | volunteers]] to come and take part in providing necessary assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Observed Needs and Solutions

Volunteers observe that the needs of homeless individuals extend far beyond basic provisions. To effectively address [[challenges_faced_by_homeless_individuals | homelessness]], a comprehensive approach is required:

*   **Property and Housing**
    *   There is a critical need for buildings, flats, or other properties to house people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Some individuals require [[importance_of_supported_housing | supported housing]], not just independent living, especially if they are working through past trauma or abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This [[importance_of_supported_housing | supported housing]] would provide them with assistance until they can deal with their problems and move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

*   **Support Services**
    *   Many homeless individuals need a package of support tailored to their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   This includes support for [[addressing_mental_health_and_addiction_among_homeless_people | mental health issues]] and [[addressing_mental_health_and_addiction_among_homeless_people | drug addictions]], which requires funding to connect them with different organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   Support is also necessary for those with alcohol problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   Volunteers need to be able to work alongside the homeless and understand their experiences, providing support for whatever problems they face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
    *   Some individuals have experienced horrendous abuse, which they may still be dealing with even in older age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Overview
The Red Arrow is a bus service operated by [[trent_barton_bus_service | trent barton bus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The buses are generally described as "brilliant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Ticket Information
A "zigzag ticket" for the Red Arrow costs five quid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This ticket allows for unlimited travel from 9 am <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Onboard Amenities
*   **Wi-Fi**: The onboard Wi-Fi service is highlighted as "brilliant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Tables**: Buses are fitted with tables for passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Issues
A primary concern raised is that the onboard tables are "far too shiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This causes items placed on them to slide around easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. An example showed a bottle sliding off a shiny surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This issue is categorized as [[issues_with_shiny_tables_on_buses | completely pointless]] due to the lack of grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Proposed Solution
A solution to the sliding problem on the shiny tables is to use a non-slip "ripped liner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> or a microfiber mat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. With this material, items like bottles will not move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, even when the bus is moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. It is suggested that this material could be stitched into the tables to improve usability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

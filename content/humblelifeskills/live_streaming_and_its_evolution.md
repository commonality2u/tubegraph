Live streaming platforms have existed for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. However, recent developments have led to increased public awareness and adoption of the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Recent Developments in Live Streaming

Apps like Meerkat, which is a live streaming application, garnered significant attention at events such as SXSW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Following Meerkat's emergence, [[benefits_of_using_periscope_compared_to_youtube_or_facebook_live | Periscope]] also became a widely discussed live streaming app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The key distinction between these newer apps and previous live streaming methods is the ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>:

## Factors Influencing Adoption

The integration of live streaming with Twitter is considered a crucial factor in its increased adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The timing of this integration was also critical, as the widespread use of Twitter by a diverse audience, including non-technical individuals and celebrities, made the platform a natural fit for live streaming's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

A link page serves as a single URL portal, often used in social media bios (e.g., Twitter, TikTok, Instagram) to direct followers to multiple platforms or content links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These pages are thought to be inspired by musician link pages, which direct users to various music platforms like Deezer and iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

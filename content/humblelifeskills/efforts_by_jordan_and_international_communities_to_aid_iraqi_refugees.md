Approximately half a million Iraqis have sought refuge in Jordan, fleeing violence and instability in their homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. While some wealthy individuals manage to secure official residence permits, jobs, and comfortable lives, the majority are less fortunate, existing in a "twilight zone" without official status or legal rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Many lack valid visas and passports, rendering their presence in Jordan technically illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Trapped between a dangerous homeland and an inability to travel elsewhere, their lives are on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Jordan's Initial Response

Unlike traditional refugee scenarios, Iraqis in Jordan are not housed in camps but integrate into Amman's urban landscape, renting flats in more affordable neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Jordan, alongside Syria, opened its borders to Iraqis at a time when many other countries were not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The country has also taken steps to allow Iraqi children to enroll in local schools, ensuring they do not miss out on an education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. These measures have provided a vital lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Iraqis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## [[challenges_faced_by_iraqi_refugees_in_jordan | Challenges Faced by Iraqi Refugees in Jordan]]

Despite initial efforts, the situation for many Iraqi refugees remains desperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The veneer of normality, often seen in satellite televisions in their modest homes, is very thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Lack of Legal Status and Work Permits
Poor and middle-class Iraqis typically do not possess work permits or long-term residence permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Without legal employment, they are condemned to poverty and rely on handouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Many resort to working illegally for cut-price wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Risk of Deportation
The absence of valid visas means refugees can be deported at any time, for any reason, back to Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Some have already been forced back into the country they fled in fear, their fates unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Pervasive Fear and Invisibility
Fear, the primary reason for their flight, remains a constant presence. Iraqis in Jordan live in fear of the police, of each other, of the past, and of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Many choose to live invisibly to avoid drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. One refugee described their preferred way of life:
> "The best way to live here in Jordan for me is to be invisible and unseen. Invisible if you can do such things to be invisible, it's okay, it will be, it's relatively safe than to be visible. So, this is what you call see the saying of my way of life here in Jordan, to be invisible, unknown, and unseen, unorganized. It's better, it's safe." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

### Depletion of Resources and Despair
As years pass, conditions in exile worsen, leading to despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Many refugees arrived with savings, expecting to stay for only six to nine months, but these resources have now run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This has led to a much more desperate situation for their families, who are struggling to sustain themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## International Community's Response

The international community was initially slow to react to Iraq's refugee crisis, remaining in a state of denial about the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. While there has been a dawning recognition of the issue, governments and aid organizations have struggled to keep pace with the realities on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### UNHCR's Efforts
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has spearheaded relief efforts, providing basic humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Significant progress has been made since 2006, when practically no help was offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. UNHCR now supports:
*   Food distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>
*   Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>
*   Psychological counseling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>
*   Emergency cash handouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>

### Resettlement Limitations
There has been an increase in resettlements, with a few thousand refugees starting new lives in Europe and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. However, this is a tiny minority, with only one percent of Iraqis registered with UNHCR actually getting resettled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Continued Challenges and Despair
Imran Riza, the UNHCR's representative in Amman, stated that despite all efforts, conditions for refugees were only "barely tolerable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. He warned that the situation would become even more difficult as refugees' savings diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Riza highlighted a high level of despair among the refugees, noting they "really do not see where their future is lying right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## [[hopes_and_fears_for_the_future_among_iraqi_refugees | Hopes and Fears for the Future]]

While some Iraqi families began returning from Syria in early 2008, those in Jordan are generally unwilling to leave until their security in Iraq is guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. There is a significant concern that the international community might not sustain its relief efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. UNHCR emphasizes the need for a sustained focus on the humanitarian element of the crisis, acknowledging that it is a medium-term situation that requires ongoing support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The situation is becoming more difficult, not easier, as refugees continue to run out of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

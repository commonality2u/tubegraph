The Power Monkey Explorer is a portable power solution designed for on-the-go charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It consists of two main parts: a solar cell and the main power unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Solar Charging Capability

The solar cell component of the Power Monkey Explorer can be hung from various locations, such as the back of a car or a backpack, to capture sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A green light indicates that it is actively picking up sunlight, even in cloudy conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The solar panel folds compactly, allowing it to be easily attached to the outside of a bag, placed in a window, or even potentially used on the outside of an airplane window (though asking for permission is advised) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Connectivity Features

The primary unit holds the stored power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Users can press a button on the unit to illuminate a display showing the amount of power remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The Power Monkey Explorer comes with a variety of different connectors to ensure broad [[compatibility_with_apps_and_devices | device compatibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. For example, one included connector is specifically designed for the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. To charge a device, the solar cell can be plugged in and left to charge the unit, typically with the solar cell outside a bag and the unit inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Later, if no power socket is available, the unit can be directly connected to an iPhone to provide a charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

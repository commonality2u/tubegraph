The Lambus project exemplifies [[low_impact_development_and_its_goals | Low Impact Development]] (LID) as a new direction for rural areas, focusing on labor and design-intensive systems instead of fossil fuel-intensive ones to enhance rural land productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. LID utilizes tools like [[Permaculture and Sustainable Farming Practices | permaculture]] and simple living to enable intensive tending of land by people, contrasting with modern farming which is people-scarce and fossil fuel-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Low Impact Development Policy in Pembrokeshire

Pembrokeshire is currently the only area in Britain with a specific [[low_impact_development_and_its_goals | Low Impact Development]] policy, offering a unique opportunity for projects like Lambus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This policy allows development and living on agricultural land, provided the land is worked for livelihood in an ecologically sound manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### Permitting Challenges

Obtaining planning permission for the Lambus project required significant negotiation with Pembrokeshire County Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Despite these negotiations, the project now operates under this special policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### Future Opportunities

There is a strong hope that similar [[low_impact_development_and_its_goals | Low Impact Development]] legislation will soon be implemented across Wales and eventually the whole of Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Site Selection and Resource Assessment

The project specifically sought landowners willing to sell land for a [[low_impact_development_and_its_goals | Low Impact Development]] project in Pembrokeshire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The current site was chosen due to several key assets:
*   A reliable source of spring water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   An existing hydroelectric power plant fed by an old mill leat, constructed over 150 years ago, requiring only minor refurbishment to become operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

The land is south-facing and considered good, but it is part of a large amount of higher-altitude land (above 150m) typically used only for low-productivity grazing in Wales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. A key aim of the project is to demonstrate that [[low_impact_development_and_its_goals | Low Impact Development]] can be successful not just on prime agricultural land, but also on widely available and often underutilized land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. The project focuses on reconditioning thin topsoil and building more, transforming land previously only suitable for grazing into a more productive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### [[Utilizing Natural Resources for Sustainable Living | Sustainable Land Management]] Practices

To improve soil quality, the project has:
*   Removed sheep to address overgrazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   Planted trees to cycle nutrients into the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   Seeded the soil with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance plant and soil connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   Used green manures, nitrogen-fixing plants, and introduced more organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
*   Grown and cut nitrogen-rich shrubs, returning them to the soil, and undertaken large-scale composting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

In [[Permaculture and Sustainable Farming Practices | permaculture]] design, every element serves multiple functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. For example, planted willows provide firewood, act as a windbreak to create a microclimate for [[Permaculture and Sustainable Farming Practices | forest gardens]] and cereal crops, demarcate fields, and serve as a craft wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

## Expenditure and Resource-Based Development

Major group expenditures include trackways for land access and the centralized provision of water and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Individual families' main expenditures are predominantly their buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

A core principle is to meet needs (e.g., shelter, warm dry space) using available on-site resources like wood, clay, and stone, rather than purchasing marketplace products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. This approach minimizes costs; for instance, a dwelling is expected to cost between £2,000 and £3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. The project prioritizes buying tools to facilitate work and resource utilization, rather than finished products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. There is also a focus on tool-making, including using a homemade forge on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

The Sennheiser CX 380 sport headphones come in a "super hip looking Strange plasticky Case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Design and "Sport" Features
These headphones are wired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A key "sport bit" design element is that the wires are "slightly offset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> to prevent them from snagging easily while running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The headphones are described as "very very light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Sound Quality
The Sennheiser CX 380 headphones offer a "very nice sound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Color and Visibility
The headphones are yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, which is considered "very nice" for visibility. This brightness makes them easier to spot if left on a table or when traveling, helping to prevent forgetting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, their yellow color can blend in with similarly colored bags, such as an "orangey yellow" guitar bag, making them hard to locate if not stored in their case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The speaker keeps them in their plastic case for easy identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For more information on this aspect, see [[color_and_aesthetics_of_headphones | Color and Aesthetics of Headphones]].

## Durability Expectations
Based on past experience, the speaker notes that previous headphones they have purchased have "always broke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, leading to an observation period to "see how long these last" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For broader concerns, see [[durability_concerns_with_sport_headphones | Durability Concerns with Sport Headphones]]. The speaker is saving up for [[comparison_to_ultimate_ears | Ultimate Ears]] but doesn't use headphones long enough to justify such an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Overview

The B doc format is the default [[estonias_digital_id_system | digital signature]] format used in [[estonias_digital_id_system | Estonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Documents that have been [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digitally signed]] are saved in this format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Characteristics

The B doc format functions similarly to a zip file, containing the signed documents as "container content" within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. When [[process_of_digitally_signing_multiple_documents | multiple documents are signed in a batch]], they are condensed into a single B doc file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, with all contents placed inside that one file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Usage

When [[process_of_digitally_signing_multiple_documents | signing documents]] using the [[DigiDoc3 application for document signing | DigiDoc3]] application with an [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | Estonian digital ID card]] or [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | e-residency]], the output files are saved in B doc format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This process allows for [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digital signatures]] that are as straightforward as signing something in person, leveraging the encryption of the [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | Estonian digital ID card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

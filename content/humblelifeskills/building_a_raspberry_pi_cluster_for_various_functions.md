A new project, temporarily named "Switchboard," is underway to create a portable cluster of Raspberry Pi computers, each dedicated to a different function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:15">[04:22:15]</a>. This approach aims to utilize individual Raspberry Pi units for distinct tasks, rather than having one Raspberry Pi perform multiple functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:26">[04:54:26]</a>.

## Background: Current Raspberry Pi Use

The speaker currently uses a Raspberry Pi in their caravan as a media setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. This setup includes a 99-pound IPS screen mounted on the wall, connected to a Raspberry Pi running Kodi (kodi.tv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. Kodi is a media player that links various content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>. The audio from this setup connects to a sound dock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:23">[01:38:23]</a>. The Raspberry Pi, a router, and a three-terabyte drive are all connected in a compact package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:34">[01:45:34]</a>.

A Raspberry Pi is described as a computer in a box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:42">[03:46:42]</a>, allowing users to build a media player for approximately 30-35 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:37">[04:07:37]</a>.

## The Switchboard Project: A Multi-Functional Raspberry Pi Cluster

The "Switchboard" project is inspired by existing Raspberry Pi clusters built for computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>, but aims for a different application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:01">[04:42:01]</a>. Instead of multiple Pis working on a single task, this project envisions individual "slices" of Raspberry Pi hardware, stacked together, each performing a unique function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:33">[04:57:33]</a>. The entire system will be housed within a portable, laser-cut box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:04">[05:33:04]</a>.

### Envisioned Functions

The cluster is designed to handle various tasks, including:
*   Kodi (media player) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:27">[05:09:27]</a>
*   [[using_raspberry_pi_for_minecraft_server_setup | Minecraft server setup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:35">[05:12:35]</a>
*   Mumble server (audio teamspeak) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:07">[05:14:07]</a>
*   Graphing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:07">[05:19:07]</a>
*   Tweet wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:07">[05:20:07]</a>
*   Drop cam preview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>
*   Audio Pi (high-end audio file music server) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>
*   Solar and power tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:07">[05:27:07]</a>
*   Newsletter sign-up (for events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:21">[05:29:21]</a>

The plan is to create downloadable image files for these functions, allowing users to easily install them onto an SD card and run them on a Raspberry Pi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:07">[09:42:07]</a>.

### Hardware and Design Considerations

The project will primarily utilize the new Raspberry Pi 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:02">[02:48:02]</a>.
**Raspberry Pi 2 Specifications:**
*   Six times faster than the previous model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:09">[02:50:09]</a>
*   One gigabyte of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:47">[03:12:47]</a>
*   Broadcom quad-core CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:26">[03:15:26]</a>
*   Micro USB power slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>
*   Four USB ports (two more than the previous version) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>
*   Full-size HDMI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:07">[03:25:07]</a>
*   Four-pole stereo output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:07">[03:25:07]</a>
*   Composite video port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>
*   Retains the same price point as the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:02">[03:28:02]</a>

The box design for the [[designing_a_portable_raspberry_pi_cluster_box | portable Raspberry Pi cluster]] will incorporate cooling, possibly using Fractal Design Silent Series R2 case fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. The fans will be placed at the bottom, with an air filter at the top, to ensure proper airflow over the stacked Raspberry Pis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a>. The design aims to be a case that can be held and transported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:07">[06:05:07]</a>. Aluminium fans with filters have already been purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:04">[09:22:04]</a>.

The project also involves integrating the system into the caravan by cutting out sections of existing cupboards to insert 13.3-inch LCD screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:04">[06:47:04]</a>. The central unit will power these screens, with breakout and splitter cables to distribute connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:06">[09:04:06]</a>.

### Project Logistics and Future Steps

The project is planned to be a weekly endeavor, with a new Raspberry Pi added to the stack each week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. A video documenting the utilization of each processor and its specific function will be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. This staggered acquisition is due to cost considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:02">[07:54:02]</a>.

Future considerations include:
*   Powering multiple units: Investigating battery banks or a large power source with split micro USBs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   Networking: Connecting 10 Raspberry Pis, potentially using a 10-port or 4-gigabit switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.
*   Headless operation and audio routing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
*   Using a network mapping and CPU analysis tool like Nagios to monitor individual CPU power usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:07">[08:28:07]</a>.
*   Designing a custom box with handles using a 3D laser wood cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

### Practical Applications

The portability of the "Switchboard" offers several advantages:
*   **Caravan integration:** Consolidates multiple Raspberry Pi functions into one central unit, solving the problem of installing individual units in different spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.
*   **Event use:** The unit can be taken from the caravan and used at events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>, with interchangeable SD cards for different functions, such as a channel manager for multi-screen displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
*   **Educational purposes:** The box can be used to train children at CoderDojo, providing a 10-user machine with various SD cards (e.g., for [[using_raspberry_pi_for_minecraft_server_setup | Minecraft server setup]]) that links to existing screens at a venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   **Client solutions:** A wooden sleeve could be created for clients to hire the box, allowing them to insert SD cards for different functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

The project began with the purchase of a new Raspberry Pi 2 for the speaker's Kodi setup, freeing up the older Raspberry Pi for their daughter's [[using_raspberry_pi_for_minecraft_server_setup | Minecraft server setup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The Raspberry Pi 2 runs a new version of Kodi that leverages its increased power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

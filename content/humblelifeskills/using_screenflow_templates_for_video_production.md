[[automating_video_editing_with_screenflow | Automating video editing]] is significantly enhanced by using templates in ScreenFlow, which can streamline the entire video production workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Templates allow for the automation of intros, outro audio, crossfades, green-screen effects, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Template Functionality
Instead of just recording the screen, microphone, and camera, users can select a pre-made template in ScreenFlow before recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This template then serves as the base, arranging the recorded elements in a pre-formatted way, which greatly [[screenflow_template_configuration_and_structure | speeds up productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. ScreenFlow identifies these template files with a "template" label next to the file name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Placeholder Clips
ScreenFlow 8.22 allows the insertion of "template placeholder clips" via the insert tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. These placeholders include:
*   Screen recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   Computer audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Camera and microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   iOS devices (when plugged in via USB, enabling screen recording from a phone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

## Template Structure and Layers
Templates are built using multiple layers to achieve desired visual and audio arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Borders
Pre-defined borders can be created as a separate layer, often nested together for easier management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. These borders (left, right, bottom, top) can be customized for color at any point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Their duration can be set, for example, to appear for a specific period like two seconds for an intro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Intro Logo and Text
An intro logo and text can be composed of grouped layers, including a top text, text underneath, an image, and an annotation (such as a black background with adjusted opacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Text elements can also include effects like drop shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Background Video
A background video file can be set to play at the bottom layer of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## [[enhancing_audio_with_screenflow | Automated Audio Processing]]
Templates can be configured to apply audio filters automatically as pre-processing to the camera and microphone input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. By extracting the audio into a separate layer, filters like compression, master gain, release time, and limiter can be set up in advance, ensuring consistent audio quality without manual adjustments after recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## [[creating_animations_and_effects_in_screenflow | Dynamic Visuals with Actions and Presets]]
ScreenFlow templates leverage "actions" and "style presets" to create dynamic visual effects automatically.

### Actions
By selecting a layer and clicking the action button, users can add an action layer on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. These actions can be time-sensitive and applied to move, enlarge, rotate, or crop elements within the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. For example, a webcam image can be moved from left to right during an intro, then back to the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Style Presets
Once a set of desired effects (like positioning and scaling) is found, it can be saved as a "style preset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. These presets can then be applied to layers, allowing for quick and consistent application of transformations (e.g., shrinking a webcam view into a bottom-left corner) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Using ScreenFlow templates significantly speeds up video production for platforms like Dtube or YouTube by pre-configuring effects, transitions, and layouts, allowing creators to focus on content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

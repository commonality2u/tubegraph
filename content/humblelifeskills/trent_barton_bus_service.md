The Trent Barton bus service operates the [[red_arrow_bus_features | Red Arrow]] bus, which travels between Trent and Burton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[phil_campbell_community | Phil Campbell]], a user of the service, highlighted its features and a notable issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Ticket and Features
A "Zigzag ticket" costs five pounds and allows for unlimited travel from 9 AM onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The buses themselves are described as "brilliant," as is the Wi-Fi service provided onboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Issues with Tables
The primary issue noted is the excessively [[issues_with_shiny_tables_on_buses | shiny surfaces of the tables]] on the bus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This shininess causes items, such as bags or bottles, to slide around easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Proposed Solution for Tables
A [[solution_for_nonslip_surface_on_bus_tables | non-slip grip liner]] is suggested as a solution to prevent items from sliding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. When demonstrated, a bottle placed on the non-slip surface remained stationary, unlike one on the untreated shiny surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A one-pound microfiber mat is specifically mentioned as an effective non-slip option that could be stitched into the tables to alleviate stress for passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

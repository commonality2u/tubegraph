A unique gadget received from the UK is the USB Missile Launcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This device is designed to plug into a computer, allowing users to aim, target, and fire small missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It includes a launch sound effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Features and Availability
The [[hightech_gaming_equipment_and_setups | USB missile launcher]] connects via [[device_connectivity_options | USB]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> and operates with included [[the_role_of_technology_in_modern_work_and_communication | software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The speaker recounts an addiction to buying t-shirts from Threadless online, describing themselves as an "addict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This purchasing habit was made easy by a three-click process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Additional Costs
A significant impact on these purchases was the imposition of customs duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This duty added an extra 20 to the cost of receiving the items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Financial Strain
Despite the additional cost, the speaker indicates that they "found the money," even if it meant not eating for some weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The addiction to purchasing, combined with these duties, led to the accumulation of 50 shirts, which was recognized as "getting out of hand" and necessitated buying a new cupboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This situation exemplifies aspects of [[consumerism_and_its_effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

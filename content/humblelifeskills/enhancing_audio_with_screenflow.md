ScreenFlow offers powerful features, particularly through its templating system, to enhance and pre-process audio, significantly speeding up video production workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Utilizing Audio in Templates

When recording with a ScreenFlow template, you can select your microphone and other audio inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The template can be structured to automatically arrange these recorded elements, including audio, into the file in a specific way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This allows for pre-formatting the look and sound of your video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

ScreenFlow version 8.22 and later allows for inserting template placeholder clips for various inputs, including computer audio, camera, and microphone audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. It can also record audio from iOS devices connected via USB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Audio Pre-processing with Filters

A key capability for [[using_screenflow_templates_for_video_production | video production templates]] is the ability to extract audio from the camera and microphone placeholder into a separate layer or channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This allows you to manipulate the audio independently without affecting other elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

By selecting the audio layer and navigating to the audio tab, you can apply audio filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. These filters can be set up to apply *before* you even start recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Applying Audio Filters via Style Presets

ScreenFlow allows you to use style presets, such as an "Apple effects batch," to apply an Apple codec to an audio layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This means you can pre-set various audio parameters:
*   Compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   Master gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   Release time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   Limiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>

These settings will be applied as pre-processing to the audio after the video has been recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

> [!info] Workflow Benefit
> Instead of manually adjusting audio levels and applying effects after each recording, ScreenFlow templates can take the raw inputs (screen, web camera, and audio) and automatically apply predefined effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This results in a final file where the content is already changed and adapted based on the template's audio settings, significantly speeding up production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Capturing System Audio

ScreenFlow templates can also be configured to capture any audio playing out from your computer system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This is part of the "screen recording and computer audio placement" placeholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Troubleshooting Audio Sync Issues

When [[creating_animations_and_effects_in_screenflow | manipulating layers]] in templates, such as cutting and pasting audio layers, it's crucial to ensure that the timing is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. If audio layers are copied and pasted without considering the timeline, the audio can become out of sync, as it might play from the beginning of the track instead of the desired point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

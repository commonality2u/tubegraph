Agile Messenger is a mobile chat application demonstrated on a Nokia N80 Symbian S60 phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It allows users to connect to multiple instant messaging services and share media directly from their mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Key Features

### Multi-Service Connectivity
Agile Messenger allows users to connect to more than one chat service simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Supported services include:
*   ICQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   AOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Yahoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Google (Gtalk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   MSN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

### Integration with Social Media
The application facilitates [[social_media_interaction_and_community_engagement | social media interaction]] by allowing users to update their Twitter feed directly from the chat client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This means a message sent via instant message within Agile Messenger can update a user's Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Media Sharing
Agile Messenger supports direct media sharing, such as sending images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Users can take a photo with their phone's camera and then select a contact from their list to send the image to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The recipient receives the image as a file transfer directly to their chat client, whether they are using MSN or potentially Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Background Operation & Data Usage
The service can be hidden and run in the background on the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. When not actively sending messages, it consumes minimal data from the user's tariff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The application also loads quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> and can be accessed directly from the phone's programs menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Connectivity Options
Agile Messenger can connect via Wi-Fi or 3G networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. On the Nokia N80, it was demonstrated connecting via Orange Internet on a 3G network due to Wi-Fi signal limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### User Options
Key options available include:
*   **Auto-connect on start**: Automatically connects to all configured chat clients when the phone is turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Full screen mode**: A new option at the time of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Compatibility and Recommendations
The performance of Agile Messenger can vary between mobile platforms, as highlighted in a [[comparison_of_agile_messenger_on_different_mobile_platforms | comparison of Agile Messenger on different mobile platforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. While considered "the best" chatting program for mobile devices due to its multi-service capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, the Windows Mobile 5 version, specifically on a Dash phone, was noted as having issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Users are advised against installing it on a Dash phone due to reported problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Developers hoped for a fix for the Windows Mobile 5 version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The version for Symbian S60 on the Nokia N80 was shown to be functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

LaborX is presented as an accessible platform for freelancers, especially those new to cryptocurrency, offering an intuitive interface for managing payments and building a professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Building Reputation on LaborX

Upon completing a job on LaborX, a freelancer's reputation score is enhanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This score is a cumulative measure derived from:
*   Reviews received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Completed contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   Profile completeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

The score is displayed as a value out of 100, such as 51 out of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. A higher score directly translates to increased visibility for a freelancer's gigs when users browse the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. To improve this algorithmic ranking, freelancers should:
*   Complete more jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Do so quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   Manage client interactions efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Minimize disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

## Managing Payments and Cryptocurrency

LaborX facilitates [[getting_paid_with_crypto_on_laborxcom|getting paid with crypto]] by providing a straightforward withdrawal process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Wallet and Balances
Each user has a unique wallet address displayed as a long string of characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. All different account types on LaborX are consolidated under this single account number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Funds, such as USDT (Tether), are held as a balance within this wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Withdrawal Process
To withdraw funds, users need to have a balance of Ethereum (ETH) in their account to cover "gas" fees, which are necessary to fund transactions on the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The withdrawal interface allows users to view their balances, select the amount to send, and input the recipient's address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Gas Price Calculator
LaborX includes a gas price calculator, which helps users understand the current cost of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Users can choose from suggested gas prices or input a custom price, though a price that is too low will significantly delay the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. It is crucial for crypto users to hold a balance in Ethereum to cover these gas fees, especially when converting ERC20 tokens from one cryptocurrency to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. External resources like gasstation.info can also be used to monitor current gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Transaction Transparency
LaborX provides clear visibility into transaction details on the Ethereum blockchain, showing income amounts and allowing users to view a PDF or jump directly to Etherscan for public transaction information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This transparency offers security and traceability for payments, unlike traditional banking methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Future Improvements
The platform could potentially improve its financial reporting features by allowing freelancers to collect annual job data as a PDF for tax purposes, or integrate with accounting software like Xero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Integration with [[payment_x|Payment X]] might also lead to reduced fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## [[premium_account_benefits_and_time_tokens_on_laborxcom|Premium Account Benefits and Time Tokens]]

LaborX offers a premium account status with several benefits:
*   **Zero Fees:** Freelancers pay zero fees, saving 5% on contracts, and customers save 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Cashback:** Freelancers receive 1% of the contract amount back to their wallet after completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Visibility:** Premium account holders receive a badge and are listed higher in the "browse gigs" section, increasing their prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

To become a premium account owner, users must hold and deposit 150 TIME tokens to their connected wallet, typically managed through a MetaMask plugin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. TIME tokens can be acquired from:
*   TimeX exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
*   KuCoin (via BTC or USDT pairs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   UniSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

As of the recording, 150 TIME tokens were valued at approximately 559 Australian dollars or 315 British pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Advantages of Crypto Payments for Freelancers

The use of cryptocurrency for payments on platforms like LaborX offers distinct advantages over traditional banking or remittance services:
*   **Financial Control:** Freelancers gain immediate financial control over their earnings, as funds are paid directly into their account with no delays or "ifs and buts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Speed and Liquidity:** Payments are processed much faster than traditional bank transfers or services like Western Union, providing quick access to liquid funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This eliminates the need to wait days or weeks for payments to clear, which is crucial in a digital society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Security:** Every transaction on the blockchain is public and traceable from start to finish, providing detailed information about its status and estimated completion time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This offers a mental security regarding the payment's delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Ease for Businesses:** Businesses can use platforms like [[payment_x|Payment X]] to pay suppliers and employees globally directly with crypto, reducing the red tape associated with international hiring and paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

The LP Micro by Light Panels is a favored piece of kit, distinguished as an [[led_lighting_technology | LED]]-enabled light panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Key Features

### Design and Mounting
The unit features a standard hot shoe attachment on its base, allowing for easy mounting on cameras or video cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It also includes a pivot mechanism, enabling the panel to tilt forwards and backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Power and Operation
The LP Micro operates on four batteries, supporting rechargeable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It accepts 5 to 12 volts DC input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Light intensity is controlled via a simple dial wheel located on the top of the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Turning this dial gradually illuminates the [[led_lighting_technology | LEDs]], allowing users to adjust the power output to their desired level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. On a full charge, the panel can last for approximately 3 to 4 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Light Output
The [[led_lighting_technology | LEDs]] in the LP Micro are daylight bulbs with a color temperature of 5,300 Kelvin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Practical Applications
This light panel is particularly effective in low-light environments, such as clubs, bars, or any very dark situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. When used with a camera or video camera, it provides sufficient light to create a pleasant glow and enhances video detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Suggested Improvements
A desire has been expressed for a smaller version of the LP Micro, approximately half its current size, which could feature a clip to attach to devices like the Flip camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This would address the common issue of poor low-light performance in devices utilizing CMOS sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Pricing
The LP Micro from Light Panels retails for about [[pricing_and_value_of_lp_micro_light_panel | Â£120]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, and is considered to be worth its cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

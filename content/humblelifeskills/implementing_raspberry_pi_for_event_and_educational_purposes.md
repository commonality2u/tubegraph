The Raspberry Pi, a compact computer, is being explored for diverse applications in both event management and educational settings, leveraging its affordability and versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The latest iteration, the Raspberry Pi 2, offers significantly enhanced processing power, making it suitable for more demanding tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Current Raspberry Pi Media Setup

As a precursor to more complex projects, a Raspberry Pi is currently used for a [[raspberry_pi_media_setup_in_a_caravan | media setup in a caravan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This setup features a 99-pound IPS screen mounted on the wall, allowing for flexible viewing, including from bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It runs Kodi (kodi.tv), a media player that links to various content sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The Raspberry Pi, along with a router and a three-terabyte drive, is connected to a sound dock for audio output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The existing Raspberry Pi will be replaced with the faster Raspberry Pi 2 for improved Kodi performance, and the older unit will be repurposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## The "Switchboard" Project: A Multi-Functional Raspberry Pi Cluster

A key initiative is the development of a Raspberry Pi "switchboard" â€“ a novel approach to [[building_a_raspberry_pi_cluster_for_various_functions | building a Raspberry Pi cluster for various functions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Unlike traditional clusters that compute a single task, this project envisions individual Raspberry Pi units, or "slices," each performing a distinct function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The goal is to stack these units together within a portable, laser-cut box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Targeted Functions

The "switchboard" aims to support a range of applications, including:
*   **Media Playback:** Kodi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Gaming Servers:** A [[using_raspberry_pi_for_minecraft_server_setup | Minecraft server setup]] for educational or recreational use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Communication:** A Mumble server for audio teamspeak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Data Visualization:** Graphing and tweet walls for events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Monitoring:** Dropcam preview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **High-End Audio:** An "audio Pi" for audiophile-grade music serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Environmental Tracking:** Solar and power tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Event Engagement:** Newsletter sign-up functionality for events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Network Analysis:** Utilizing tools like Nagios for network mapping and CPU analysis across individual machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Hardware and Design Considerations

The project heavily relies on the Raspberry Pi 2, which boasts a Broadcom quad-core CPU, 1GB of RAM, four USB ports, full-size HDMI, and a four-pole stereo output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

#### Portable Casing
A significant aspect of the project is [[designing_a_portable_raspberry_pi_cluster_box | designing a portable Raspberry Pi cluster box]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This custom case will be laser-cut and include cooling mechanisms such as Fractal Design Silent Series R2 case fans, arranged to pull air over the stacked Raspberry Pis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Filters for air intake are also planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The design aims for a compact form factor that can be easily transported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

#### Power and Networking
Powering multiple Raspberry Pis within the cluster requires consideration of a central power source that can split micro USB connections to each unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Networking will involve integrating all ten units into a Gigabit Ethernet switch, potentially using flat cabling for space efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

#### Display Integration
The "switchboard" unit is intended to power multiple external screens, potentially by splitting video signals, rather than requiring a dedicated Raspberry Pi for each display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. In the caravan, these screens are planned to fit into existing cupboard spaces, measuring 13.3 inches across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Educational and Event Applications

The "switchboard" concept offers significant potential for both educational and event contexts:
*   **Training Kids:** The portable box, loaded with specific SD cards for different functions (e.g., Minecraft), could be used for training sessions like CoderDojo, providing a multi-user machine in a small, self-contained unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Event Management:** The cluster can serve as a channel manager for multi-screen displays at events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Its portability allows it to be moved between the caravan and various event venues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Client Solutions:** A wooden sleeve or custom box could be offered to clients for hire, allowing them to swap out SD cards for different functions at their events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

> "The ability to make it portable as well, because I got it got me thinking that I could take it from the caravan, take the different SD cards out, put different SD cards in for different events." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>

The project aims to release pre-configured image files that can be downloaded and placed directly onto SD cards, simplifying deployment for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This iterative development, with new Raspberry Pis acquired weekly, allows for consistent progress and documentation of how each processor is utilized for a specific function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

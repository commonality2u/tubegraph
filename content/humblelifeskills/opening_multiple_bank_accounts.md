The process of [[visiting_a_bank | visiting a bank]] can involve opening multiple accounts simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The speaker intended to open three different accounts during one visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Types of Accounts

The individual planned to open:
*   Ella's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   A [[starting_a_small_business | business account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   A community account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

### Perceived Concerns

Opening three bank accounts at once led the speaker to express concern that bank staff might perceive them as "some kind of fraudster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

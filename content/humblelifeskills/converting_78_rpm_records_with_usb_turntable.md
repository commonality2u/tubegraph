A [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] can be used to convert old 78 RPM records to a digital format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This method was acquired to assist a client with approximately 500 such records that needed [[converting_78_rpm_records_to_digital_format | conversion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, as a traditional record player was not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Turntable Overview and Features

The [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] used for this purpose was purchased from Firebox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

*   **Compatibility** The [[usb_turntable_features_and_functionality | USB turntable]] is compatible with both PC and Mac computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Connectivity** A USB cable connects directly from underneath the turntable to the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It also features a line out and RCA phono/line outputs, allowing other audio sources to be fed into it for recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Size** The unit is described as "quite a big unit" when on a desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Cost** The turntable costs approximately £120 in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Included Software** The turntable comes with "Odyssey," a free wave program available for both Mac and PC, which can be used for recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Specifics for 78 RPM Records

78 RPM records are notably thick, and their grooves are more defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

*   **Heads/Needles** While the turntable did not initially include an extra head for 78 RPM records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, different heads can be acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. A dedicated 78 RPM head was later received from Firebox, priced around £15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. It is speculated that the 78 RPM needle may be thicker to accommodate the records' characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Software Speed Adjustment** The included software allows for the speed of 78 RPM recordings to be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## [[setting_up_and_using_a_usb_turntable | Setting up and Using the USB Turntable]]

Upon [[setting_up_and_using_a_usb_turntable | setup]], users can preview the audio coming through the record player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### [[troubleshooting_common_issues_with_the_usb_turntable | Troubleshooting Common Issues]]

One significant [[troubleshooting_common_issues_with_the_usb_turntable | challenge]] during [[setting_up and using a USB turntable | initial setup]] was the omission of the counterweight and needle, which were found hidden in the boxing material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Without the counterweight, the needle lacked the necessary force to stay down, causing the record to skip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

A noticed issue was that 33 RPM tracks played back a "little bit too slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. While the [[software_compatibility_with_usb_turntable | software]] allows for speeding up playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, it requires time to determine the optimal setting for adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This suggests that careful calibration may be necessary for 78 RPM records as well.

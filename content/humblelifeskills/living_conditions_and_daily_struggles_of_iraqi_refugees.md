Since the outbreak of violence and instability in their homeland, approximately two million Iraqis have sought refuge in neighboring countries, with about half a million finding their way to Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. While some wealthy Iraqis can secure official residence permits, run businesses, and hold jobs, the majority face significantly harsher realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## Legal Status and Economic Precarity

Most Iraqi refugees in Jordan exist in a "twilight zone," lacking official status, firm legal rights, or valid visas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Their presence is often technically illegal, with some not even possessing valid passports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Unable to return to Iraq due to fear, and denied entry to other countries, many are stranded, with their lives "on hold" and "frozen in time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This [[impact_of_lack_of_legal_status_on_iraqi_refugees | lack of legal status]] condemns poor and middle-class Iraqis to poverty and dependence on handouts, as they lack work permits or long-term residence permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Without valid visas, they face the constant threat of deportation back to Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### Urban Integration and Hidden Struggles

Unlike traditional refugee camps, Iraqis seeking refuge in Jordan typically "melt into Amman's urban scene," renting flats in cheaper neighborhoods and ostensibly living normal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. However, beneath this veneer of normality, the situation is often desperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

One example is a 37-year-old veterinary surgeon from Baghdad, who lives in bleak isolation in a small, unheated flat in a poor Amman suburb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Five members of his family, including his mother, sister, brother, and niece, were killed in Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. He survives "from hand to mouth," struggling to pay rent and sometimes finding illegal, temporary work for "cut price pay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. He noted that employers accept them due to low payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. He spent four years working to afford a television and satellite, highlighting the immense effort required for basic comforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This individual's story exemplifies the [[challenges_faced_by_iraqi_refugees_in_jordan | challenges faced by Iraqi refugees]].

## Psychological Impact and the Search for Invisibility

Years of exile and worsening conditions often lead to despair, replacing any initial [[hopes_and_fears_for_the_future_among_iraqi_refugees | hope for a better future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Despite leaving physical dangers behind, Iraqis in Jordan live in constant fear of the police, each other, the past, and the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Many adopt a strategy of self-defense, choosing to "fade away from sight" and be "invisible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. One refugee described his "way of life" as being "invisible, unknown, and unseen," believing it offers a measure of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

### Struggles with Housing and Basic Needs

Refugees, like one married individual with a three-year-old daughter, frequently move from house to house due to rising rents and electricity bills, struggling to stay warm during bitterly cold Middle Eastern winters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. For food and heat, they rely on monthly payments from the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Their exile has lasted for years, as they wait for an opportunity to escape their trapped situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This refugee noted that it is not a matter of months or a year, but "a matter of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Despite the hardships, some find fleeting moments of happiness with their children, or from the warmth of the sun, or through interactions with local neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

### Individual Aspirations and Ongoing Danger

Um Muhammad, a lab technician in downtown Amman, is raising three children, with the youngest born in exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. Her family fled Iraq in late 2004 after receiving death threats, selling their home and driving through the desert to Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Um Muhammad dreams of returning to work and finishing her studies, stating, "I like my job and I don't like to stay home and spend my life at home. I want to find a job and I find myself when I work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. Despite their aspirations, her family will not return to Iraq until security for their children is guaranteed, as it remains too dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

## International Response and Future Outlook

Jordan, along with Syria, initially opened its doors to Iraqis when many other countries did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Jordan now allows Iraqi children to enroll in local schools to continue their education, a step that has provided a lifeline to hundreds of thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. These represent some of the [[efforts_by_jordan_and_international_communities_to_aid_iraqi_refugees | efforts by Jordan and international communities to aid Iraqi refugees]].

The Iraqi refugee crisis was slow to build, and the international community was initially slow to react, often in a state of denial about the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. While there has been a "dawning of recognition," governments and aid organizations still struggle to keep pace with the realities on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

The UNHCR has spearheaded relief efforts, providing basic humanitarian assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. From offering almost no help in 2006, the UNHCR now supports food distribution, education, psychological counseling, and emergency cash handouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Despite these efforts, only about one percent of Iraqis registered with the UNHCR are resettled in other countries like Europe or the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

Imran Riza, the UNHCR's representative in Amman, stated that these efforts have only made conditions "barely tolerable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. He warned that the situation would become more difficult as refugees' savings run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. Many Iraqis, who initially expected to stay for six months to a year, are now facing increasingly "dire straits," lacking the means to sustain their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

A significant concern is the pervasive lack of [[hopes_and_fears_for_the_future_among_iraqi_refugees | hope]] among refugees, leading to "a very high level of despair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. While some families have returned to Iraq from Syria, those in Jordan are generally unwilling to leave until their security in Iraq is fully assured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. The major challenge for the international community is to maintain focus on the humanitarian element of this crisis and consolidate the relief efforts of previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. This is seen as a medium-term situation, and while some progress has been made, it has not yet reached the point of truly assisting all those in need, especially as their resources continue to dwindle, making their situation increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

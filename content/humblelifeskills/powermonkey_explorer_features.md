The PowerMonkey Explorer is a portable charging device composed of two main parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Components

### Solar Cell
The first component is a solar cell, designed for charging the unit using sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It features a small hook, allowing it to be hung from various places such as the back of a car or a backpack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A green light on the solar cell indicates when it is picking up sunlight, even in cloudy conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The solar cell folds up compactly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> and can be placed in a window or, with prior permission, on the outside of an airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Main Unit
The second component is the main unit, which stores the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. By pressing and holding a button, the unit will light up and display the current power level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Connectivity and Charging
The PowerMonkey Explorer comes with a variety of different connectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. One of the included connectors is specifically designed for the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

To charge, the solar cell can be attached to the outside of a bag, while the main unit is kept inside, allowing it to charge over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This enables users to charge their devices, such as an iPhone, later in the day even without access to a power socket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The Tekkeon 3450i is a 58-watt lithium polymer power battery [00:00:07]. It is considered superior to most rechargeable batteries due to its features and performance [00:00:16].

## Features

*   **Battery Type** The device utilizes a lithium polymer battery [00:00:13]. This type of battery is noted for holding its charge better in both cold and hot weather compared to other products, partly because it's wrapped in a polymer material [00:00:42]. While not completely impervious, it demonstrates strong [[battery_performance_in_various_conditions | performance in various conditions]] [00:00:50].
*   **Connectivity** It includes a connector that can be used with USB [00:00:20].
*   **Controls** The battery features an on/off switch [00:00:21] and dip switch settings that allow users to set different voltages [00:00:23].
*   **Charge Indicator** A button press activates a small indicator showing the current charge level [00:00:35].
*   **Cooling** The unit has a small fan located at the bottom [00:00:56].

## Performance and Use Cases

The Tekkeon 3450i has demonstrated excellent performance in challenging conditions. For example, it successfully powered a [[battery_and_power_options_for_cradlepoint | Cradlepoint PHS 300]] for approximately a day and a half in extremely hot conditions during South by Southwest in Austin [00:01:03]. The battery's power delivery was described as "spot on" even in boiling heat [00:01:14].

## Accessories and Battery Life Extension

An adapter bracket is available that allows an additional battery to be connected underneath the main unit, effectively doubling its operational life [00:01:22]. With this [[battery_life_extension_using_additional_components | battery life extension]], conservative use could potentially allow the device to run for about a week [00:01:30].

## Comparison to Tekkeon 3750

While the featured model is the 3450i, a Tekkeon 3750 model is also available [00:00:28]. The [[differences_between_tekkeon_3450i_and_3750_models | 3750 model]] exclusively offers USB connectivity and features an auto-detect function [00:00:32].

## Cost

The Tekkeon 3450i costs 120 pounds [00:00:59].

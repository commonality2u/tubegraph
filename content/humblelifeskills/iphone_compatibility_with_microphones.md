The iPhone, specifically the iPhone 3G, can be used for recording with external microphones to achieve better sound quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This setup can enable broadcast-quality sound on the move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Connecting XLR Microphones

To connect an [[compatibility_with_xlr_microphones | XLR microphone]] to an iPhone, a specific custom cable is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This cable, available from customcable.com, is an XLR to a special three-stripe connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The connection process involves:
1.  Plugging the custom cable into the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  Attaching the [[compatibility_with_xlr_microphones | XLR microphone]] to the other end of the cable afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

This allows for [[using_external_microphones_with_iphone | iPhone recording from XLR microphone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Compatible Microphone Types

Not all [[compatibility_with_xlr_microphones | XLR microphones]] will work directly with this setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. To ensure compatibility, the microphone needs to be either a dynamic mic or a [[using_powered_microphones_with_iphones | powered microphone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

*   An example of a compatible [[using_powered_microphones_with_iphones | powered microphone]] is the Rode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   [[using_powered_microphones_with_iphones | Powered microphones]] typically use an internal power source, such as a 1.5-volt AA battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Supported Applications

When using an external microphone with the iPhone, applications like Audio Boo or Fire can be utilized for recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

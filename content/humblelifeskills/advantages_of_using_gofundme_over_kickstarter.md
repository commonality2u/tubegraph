When considering crowdfunding platforms, the choice between time-limited options like Kickstarter and more flexible alternatives such as GoFundMe depends heavily on the nature of the project. While Kickstarter is well-suited for product launches, GoFundMe offers distinct advantages for ongoing or conceptual projects.

## Flexible Deadlines and Goals
Kickstarter campaigns are often described as "very time limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, which can create significant pressure to reach a funding goal by a specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This model is effective for initiatives focused on building or selling a tangible product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

In contrast, platforms like GoFundMe, which the speaker identifies as "we found this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> (later referred to as "GoFounders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> and "Go For Me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>), do not impose an end date on projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This allows creators to set a desired figure without the immediate burden of a strict timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

> "A lot of these uh crowd funding sites especially kickstarter they're very time limited and that puts a lot of pressure on you if you're uh you know to get something on a certain date" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>

## Suitability for Non-Product Projects
For projects that are still evolving ideas, or additional initiatives beyond regular work, the demands of Kickstarter can be "debilitating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This includes the need to constantly "maintain the campaign to drive it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, understand its momentum and communication needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, and consistently offer [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | perks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

GoFundMe is particularly beneficial when it is challenging to offer [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | perks]] or to meet a specific funding deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This makes it a preferred option for projects that are not primarily about selling a product to a wider base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Maintaining Interest and Sustainable Funding
GoFundMe platforms can help generate interest in a project by allowing clients to contribute to a fund, potentially at a discounted rate, rather than just paying for a service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This method can lead to "sustainable cash flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a> for the project itself and for funding future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It provides a "social layer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> where contributors can directly see how their money is used and what is happening with the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This allows for transparency and ongoing engagement with supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Such platforms can be used for advocacy work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> or ambitious long-term goals, such as acquiring land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a> and developing it for community use or events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Even with flexible funding, it is still possible to offer [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | perks]] to maintain customer attention, such as inviting donors to events or providing exclusive content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

The [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]] was unboxed in a non-traditional setting due to time constraints and a desire to focus on its build quality and ease of use, rather than a "snazzy" unboxing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The microphone had been kept in its box for about two weeks, even traveling to London and Leeds unopened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Motivation for Purchase

The speaker purchased the [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]] specifically after seeing Steve Garfield at SXSW (South by Southwest) ranting about live streaming apps like Meerkat and Periscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The appeal of these platforms lies in their one-click streaming capability, integrating seamlessly with Twitter and appealing to a broader audience beyond just tech-minded individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Product Specifications and Compatibility

The [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]] costs approximately 80 UK pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It is compatible with iOS, Mac, Windows, iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It works with various apps, including Vocal Live, iRig Recorder, Amplitube, Easy Voice, and GarageBand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Unboxing and First Impressions

The packaging is described as a "Black Box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Inside, the [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]] was "nicely packaged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Included Accessories
*   An "IK thing" (presumed to be drivers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   A small manual with pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   A mic stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>
*   A carry bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   Two cables:
    *   Micro USB to Lightning cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> (noted as an unusual and useful cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>).
    *   Another cable for older devices (implied, as the Lightning cable is highlighted as new) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Build Quality and Design
The [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]] has a "very nice weight" and feels "very solid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Its styling resembles a Shure SM58, a well-regarded vocal microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The gain control on the back is a small turning controller that sticks out slightly, but is designed to be as flush as possible and easily accessible during interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. A blue LED indicator is present on the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The microphone has a micro USB port at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

A clever design feature is a separate piece that screws into the bottom of the mic, around the micro USB cable, to secure the connection and prevent the cable from being easily pulled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Initial Testing with Apps

Upon connecting the [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]] to an iPad, no immediate visual changes occurred on the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. However, when opened, the "Fire" (presumably FiRe 2) app successfully detected the microphone as the [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]], showing sample rate options (32,000 Hz, 44,000 Hz, 48,000 Hz) and channel options (stereo, mono left, mono right, mono left and right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The microphone's blue LED turned on automatically when connected to the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. An initial issue was noted where the volume slider in the app was at maximum, and the speaker was unsure if the app fully recognized the mic's input control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Intended Use

The speaker plans to use the [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]] for:
*   Live streaming with Meerkat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   Audio recording with Audioboom and potentially SoundCloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>
*   Interviews while on the go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
*   Connecting to a boom mic for static recording with an iPhone or iPad, to enhance audio quality beyond the iPad's built-in mic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Overall Impressions

The [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]] is considered "very solid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> and "very good for podcasters [and] people on the go doing little interviews" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The speaker particularly likes the "one connector business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. While the [[comparison_of_audio_quality_between_apogee_mic_and_ipad_mic | audio quality on an iPad is already good]], this microphone is more directional and would benefit from a "fluffy" wind cover for outdoor use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

A demo video of the [[irig_mic_hd_product_review | iRig Mic HD]]'s sound quality will be posted in a separate video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

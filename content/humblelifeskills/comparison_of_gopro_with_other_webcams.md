When using a GoPro as a webcam source, there are notable differences compared to traditional webcams like the Logitech C920.

## Initial Impressions of GoPro Output

The output from a GoPro, specifically the Hero3, when connected via HDMI, appears "raw from the camera" [00:00:25]. This means it lacks the built-in processing and effects that might be applied by a dedicated webcam. The raw output may require "messing around with effects and stuff" to achieve desirable color balance and gamma [00:00:35]. The raw image "looks good" [00:01:43] and offers a "wide angle" view [00:00:21].

The speaker notes that the [[using_logitech_brio_4k_webcam | Logitech C920 webcam]] is "really quite good compared to bringing in another source" [00:00:42]. This implies that out-of-the-box, the Logitech C920 might provide a more balanced or ready-to-use image without significant post-processing. However, with "a bit of tinkering," it is possible to "get the colors right" for the GoPro output [00:00:48].

## Post-processing and Adjustments

To improve the GoPro's video feed for webcam use, adjustments are necessary. The speaker used "some effects" to enhance the raw camera feed [00:00:30]. When inputting the GoPro's HDMI feed via the Blackmagic Intensity Extreme, the signal can be used in software like Wirecast [00:02:03]. Within Wirecast, settings can be applied to "scale it up and the gamma and everything else," which results in the output looking "pretty good actually pretty darn good" [00:02:09].

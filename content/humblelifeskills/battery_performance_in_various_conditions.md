The performance of portable batteries, particularly their resilience in extreme temperatures, is a critical factor for mobile computing and photography applications. Lithium polymer batteries offer notable advantages in this regard.

## Tekkeon 3450i Battery Features
The Tekkeon 3450i is a 58-watt lithium polymer battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Key features include a USB connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, an on/off switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, and dip switch settings to adjust different voltages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. A similar model, the 3750, features only USB and auto-detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The battery has an indicator to show how full it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Temperature Resilience
The core of the Tekkeon 3450i is a lithium polymer battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This material provides significant resistance to extreme temperatures, meaning it holds its charge better than most other products in both cold and hot weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This resilience is attributed to the polymer material wrapping the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Real-World Performance
During South by Southwest in Austin, the Tekkeon 3450i successfully powered a [[battery_and_power_options_for_cradlepoint | Cradlepoint PHS 300]] for approximately a day and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This operation occurred in "absolutely boiling hot" conditions while the device was in a rucksack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, demonstrating perfect performance and spot-on power delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Battery Life Extension
An adapter bracket is available that allows a second battery to be attached underneath, effectively doubling the unit's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. With this [[battery_life_extension_using_additional_components | battery life extension using additional components]], a conservative estimate suggests the device could run for about a week in a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Observations
It has been noted that the writing on the battery casing tends to wear off over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

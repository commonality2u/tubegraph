A significant bug has been identified with the Nokia N95, specifically affecting its video recording functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Description of the Bug

When [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | recording]] video clips in succession on the N95, a specific sequence of events can lead to the device freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>:

*   Upon stopping a recording, the device prompts the user to send the clip to a destination, such as ShoZu, if integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   After recording a couple of clips in succession, the device asks if the user wants to save those clips to the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   If the camera is pointed away from the user, preventing them from seeing the screen, and an attempt is made to record a third time, the N95 remains unresponsive, still awaiting a "yes" or "no" answer to the save-to-web prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Attempting to exit this state by pressing the four-cursors button leads the user to the main menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Impact and Workaround

Once in the main menu, the device becomes unresponsive, preventing the user from performing any actions, including accessing the gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This issue makes the video recording feature not very [[user_interface_problems_during_recording | user friendly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

To recover from this interface freeze, the only solution is to power the N95 off and then on again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This acts as a [[recovery_from_interface_freezes_on_n95 | recovery from interface freeze]].

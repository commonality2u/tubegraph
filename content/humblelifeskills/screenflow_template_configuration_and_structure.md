[[using_screenflow_templates_for_video_production | ScreenFlow templates]] are powerful tools designed to significantly speed up video production by automating elements like intro animations, crossfades, audio processing, and green screen effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. They serve as a pre-formatted base for new recordings, applying a pre-defined structure and effects to the input media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Utilizing Templates
Instead of merely recording the screen, microphone, and camera, users can select a pre-made template in ScreenFlow before recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This allows the template to automatically arrange and apply effects to the recorded elements once the recording is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Template Structure
A [[using_screenflow_templates_for_video_production | ScreenFlow template]] is identified in its file name, often showing "template" to the right of the primary file name, such as "one ramp - frog ScreenFlow template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Template Placeholder Clips
ScreenFlow allows the insertion of "template placeholder clips" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. These placeholders include:
*   Screen recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   Computer audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   Microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   iOS devices (when plugged in via USB, allowing screen recording from the phone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

### Layered Elements and Automation
A template often consists of multiple layers, each serving a specific purpose in the final video composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

#### Customizable Borders
Templates can include borders, structured as nested layers (e.g., left, right, bottom, and top sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. These borders can be customized by changing their colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> and their duration (e.g., set to 5 minutes to ensure they cover most typical recordings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For an intro, borders might be set to disappear after a short period, such as two seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

#### Intro Logo and Text
An intro often includes a group of layers for a logo and text, comprising top text, text underneath, an image, and an annotation (which can be a black background with adjusted opacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. [[creating_animations_and_effects_in_screenflow | Effects]] like a drop shadow can be applied to text within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

#### Pre-processed Audio
A key feature of templates is the ability to extract audio from the camera and microphone placeholders into a separate layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This allows [[enhancing_audio_with_screenflow | audio filters]] to be applied *before* the video is recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. For example, an "Apple effects batch" preset can be applied, setting up compression, master gain, release time, and limiter settings for the audio as pre-processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This [[automating_video_editing_with_screenflow | automates]] audio adjustments and ensures consistent sound quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

#### Camera and Microphone Placeholder Movement
Templates can incorporate [[creating_animations_and_effects_in_screenflow | animations]] for the camera and microphone placeholder (e.g., the webcam image). This allows the image to move across the screen (e.g., from left to right during an intro to avoid text, then back to the center) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This movement is achieved by creating "actions" on specific layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

#### Background Video and Screen Recording
A video file can be set as a background layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Below this, a screen recording placeholder can be included, allowing the user to seamlessly switch to showing their desktop by cutting out other layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Actions and Style Presets
[[creating_animations_and_effects_in_screenflow | ScreenFlow's powerful actions]] allow for time-sensitive manipulations within a template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. By selecting a layer and clicking the action button, users can create new action layers to:
*   Move elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>
*   Enlarge or scale elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
*   Rotate elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>
*   Crop elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>

Once a series of effects is applied, they can be saved as "style presets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. For example, a preset can automatically position a webcam in the bottom left corner and scale it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. These presets can be edited and applied to future videos, further enhancing [[automating_video_editing_with_screenflow | automation]] and consistency in video production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

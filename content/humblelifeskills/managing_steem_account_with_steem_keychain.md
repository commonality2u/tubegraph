## Introduction

For new users encountering [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Steem]] for the first time, especially those transitioning from [[introduction_to_steem_and_tron_for_new_users | Tron]] or revisiting Steem due to recent news, managing the multiple keys associated with a Steem account can seem daunting [00:00:02]. To simplify this process, the use of Steem Keychain is highly recommended [00:00:40].

## Benefits and Key Management

Steem Keychain is a browser extension available for Chrome [00:00:42] and Firefox [00:00:44] that significantly eases interactions with the Steem blockchain [00:00:49]. Its primary benefit is the ability to securely store and manage your Steem account keys [00:00:51].

Steem Keychain can store three essential keys:
*   Memo Key [00:00:58]
*   Posting Key [00:00:58]
*   Owner Key [00:00:58]

It is crucial to never input your Master Key into any extension or plugin, as this could compromise your entire account [00:01:04].

## Installation and Usage

After installation, Steem Keychain appears as a small browser extension [00:01:20]. It allows users to manage all their Steem accounts from one interface [00:01:24]. When a login or transaction is required, Steem Keychain will prompt you [00:01:28]. If you've set a master password for Steem Keychain, you'll enter it, and the extension will automatically fill in the necessary long, secure codes, eliminating the need for manual entry [00:01:30].

## Integration with Decentralized Applications

Steem Keychain also facilitates secure logins and interactions with decentralized applications that run on the Steem blockchain. For example, when logging into the OneLove IPFS uploader, users can select to log in with [[using_steam_connect_for_secure_login | Steam Connect]] via Steem Keychain [00:06:31]. If you've already logged in and the keychain is active, it will log you in directly, otherwise, a request will appear [00:06:37].

While [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | protective cases]] offer vital protection for mobile hardware, they can introduce specific limitations, particularly when using devices for gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Reduced Screen Sensitivity

One significant drawback of certain [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | protective cases]], such as the [[features_of_griffin_survivor_case_for_ipad_2 | Griffin Survivor case]] for the iPad 2, is a reduction in screen sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. This can negatively impact the gaming experience, especially for titles that require precise or rapid touch input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

For instance, when playing games like Grand Theft Auto 3 on an iPad 2 with this type of case, users might find it difficult to accurately control actions such as touching buttons for left and right movement, or accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a>. This reduced responsiveness can lead to [[challenges_and_frustrations_with_current_video_games | challenges and frustrations]] and hinder [[performance_and_competitiveness_in_gaming | competitive gameplay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:07">[02:15:07]</a>.

The internet is described as a "strange place" for information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. [[discussion_on_why_people_enjoy_certain_internet_personalities | People often enjoy "way out" content]] or sometimes "lame" things that are made into a big deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Featured Internet Personalities

### The London Cabby on BBC Radio One
An anecdote was shared about a London cab driver who somehow managed to get on BBC Radio One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The cabbie was supposed to be discussing MP3 technology with an interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This interview went out live, and the cab driver spoke for five or six minutes without seeming to know what he was talking about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Cab drivers are generally considered to know a lot about the world due to interacting with diverse people daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, similar to the movie *Collateral* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### "Filthy Horo"
"Filthy Horo" is an internet personality discussed for the reasons behind her popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Perception**: Some find her appealing due to an imagination that she is "filthy" because of her name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, or her "curvier" look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Delivery**: It's suggested that people subscribe to her content not just for what she says, but how she says it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. She is perceived to play on men's insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: Despite claiming not to create content for page views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> and having a boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, it is questioned why she continues if not for self-gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. It's implied that if she gains many hits, she would continue creating content to see future hit counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Contradictions**: Her association with "sign language" is seen as incongruous with her "Filthy Horo" persona, raising questions about her true ideals and whether she is trying to appear sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. She is also described as potentially "creepy" or "clingy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### "Sexy Booty"
Another internet personality mentioned is "Sexy Booty" who is noted for being able to "shake a booty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This content is deemed acceptable if it's not offending or bothering anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## [[internet_behavior_and_culture_regarding_criticism_and_haters | Internet Behavior Regarding Criticism and Haters]]
There is discussion about why there are so many "haters" online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. It is suggested that "haters" might be people who are bored and criticize what they don't possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This behavior is seen as not beneficial and not helping anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Politeness in the Real World
The conversation touches on the use of politeness, specifically "please" and "thank you," in real-world interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. It is suggested that if one is good and honest with people, it generally leads to positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Politeness is seen as exuding friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

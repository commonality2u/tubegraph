The layout of a hotel can sometimes present navigational challenges for guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. One hotel is described as having "a myriad of corridors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, contributing to a confusing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Getting Lost
The complex corridor system led to at least one instance of a guest getting lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This confusion arose when attempting to navigate through various passages, leading to incorrect turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Hotel Amenities
Despite the navigational challenges, the hotel is noted for being "really nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and features several amenities, including:
*   A grand ballroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>
*   Multiple restaurants and bars, such as "Jasmine Spar Health Club" and "Jazbar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   A non-smoking floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

A radius server is identified as a necessary component for extending wireless network capabilities and managing user access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Functionality

The primary purpose of integrating a radius server is to implement [[authentication_using_radius_for_wifi_service | authentication]] on a Wi-Fi network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This system allows for users to have specific logins, thereby controlling access to the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This controlled access could enable the network to be advertised as a service for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Implementation Context

A radius server is needed when attempting to [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | set up a Wi-Fi cloud]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Available hardware for hosting such a server includes existing [[rackmount_servers_specifications | 19-inch rack servers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. The goal is to extend Wi-Fi range beyond a home, potentially covering areas like a nearby park, to avoid reliance on expensive mobile data packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## Potential for Extended Range

With a suitable Wi-Fi aerial, such as a flat panel or a standard aerial, and a good line of sight or a reasonably high pole, it is believed possible to transmit a Wi-Fi signal up to five to ten miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Implementing radius for authentication would secure this extended service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

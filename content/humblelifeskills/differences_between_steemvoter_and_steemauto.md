This article compares two platforms, Steemvoter and Steemauto, used for managing auto-voting rules on the Steemit blockchain.

## Steemvoter Overview

Steemvoter is described as a "fairly reliable system" with a standard user interface (UI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its UI typically displays your Steem power and voting power, alongside a "rules" button to add rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Users can define rules for upvotes, including specifying vote power, vote delay, and the people to upvote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The speaker used it to upvote people who comment and reply, or individuals met in person, providing an "upswing" from delegations on their Steem account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

When Steemvoter experienced downtime, it caused issues with payouts and the automatic display of who had voted on posts, which the speaker used as a reminder to visit other users' blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The disruption highlighted the "knock-on effect to anxiety and stress" when automated systems fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Introduction to Steemauto

Following Steemvoter's disappearance, Steemauto emerged as a new alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Initially, the login process for Steemauto appeared "iffy" as it didn't seem to use Steam Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, after registration, users are given the option to log in using [[managing_steem_account_with_steem_keychain | Steam Connect]], which is a secure service akin to Facebook Connect, used by Steemit or the community to connect to the blockchain APIs securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This means users don't need multiple logins and passwords, relying instead on their Steemit account login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Steemauto is considered safe and trusted, with a user confirming it does not capture login details from the initial form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Key Differences and Features

### Auto-Voting Rules (Fan Base)
Both Steemvoter and Steemauto offer a "fan base" feature for [[setting_up_auto_vote_rules_on_steemit | setting up auto vote rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Users can add individuals, specify an upvote weight (0-100%), and set a wait time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
> "When steam voter was down I didn't know what voting rules are put in place was probably a good idea now that it's up to copy those rules down into a notepad so that you have these people if it goes down again." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>

This highlights the importance of redundancy and copying rules down in case a service goes offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Steemauto also displays "top fans" and allows following others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Advanced [[features_of_steemauto_such_as_curation_trails_and_scheduling_posts | Features of Steemauto]]

Steemauto offers several features not explicitly detailed in Steemvoter:

*   **Curation Trails**: Users can follow "curation trails" of others who actively upvote posts on Steemit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This is useful for following projects or maintaining activity when away from blogging, by setting a weight limit for upvotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Users can also become their own trail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Scheduled Posts**: Steemauto allows users to schedule posts to be published at a specific time in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This addresses a lack of a built-in scheduling feature on Steemit itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Upvote Comments**: The platform can automatically upvote comments made by users on your blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This feature can be configured with a wait time and a vote weight, allowing a maximum of two upvotes per user per day even if they make more comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This encourages regular commentators by providing remuneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Claim Rewards**: Steemauto can automatically claim rewards from the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. By enabling this feature, the system checks the account every 30 minutes to move funds to the Steem Dollar (SBD) line and Steem Power balance, reducing the need for manual claiming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Conclusion

While Steemvoter served as a "fairly reliable" auto-voting system, its unreliability led to the exploration of Steemauto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Steemauto, with its secure Steam Connect login and a wider range of features such as curation trails, scheduled posts, automated comment upvotes, and automatic reward claiming, presents a more robust and feature-rich solution for Steemit users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The speaker plans to switch all rules from Steemvoter to Steemauto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

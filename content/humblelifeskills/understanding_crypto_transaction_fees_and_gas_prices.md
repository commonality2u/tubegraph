When dealing with cryptocurrency payments, particularly on platforms like LaborX, understanding transaction fees, often referred to as "gas," is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. These fees are essential for processing transactions on a blockchain network.

## Gas in Crypto Transactions

"Gas" is the cost required to perform a transaction or execute a smart contract on a blockchain, such as Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. It's paid in the native cryptocurrency of the network; for Ethereum, this is Ether (ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Holding a balance in Ether is necessary to fund transactions, including converting one cryptocurrency to another, especially if it's an ERC20 token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## LaborX Withdrawal Process and Gas

The LaborX platform aims to simplify crypto payments for users new to the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. When you have funds, such as USDT, deposited into escrow after a job is completed, you can withdraw them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. The withdrawal process on LaborX is designed to be user-friendly, showing your balance on the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

A notable feature is the gas price calculator within the withdrawal interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This allows users to see current gas prices, which can fluctuate significantly depending on network activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Users also have an "advanced" option to manually set their desired gas price, though setting it too low can result in very long transaction times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

## Factors Affecting Gas Prices

Gas prices can be "absolutely crazy" due to high trading volumes and overall network busyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. External websites like `gasstation.info` can provide real-time updates on Ethereum gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. There is hope that future developments, like Ethereum 2.0, will bring these transaction costs down significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## Transparency and Control of Crypto Payments

One of the significant [[benefits_of_using_crypto_payments | benefits of using crypto payments]] is the transparency and control they offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. After a job is completed and payment is made, users can view the transaction details directly on the Ethereum blockchain via Etherscan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. This provides public information about the transaction, including its status and when it occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

Unlike traditional bank transfers or Western Union, which can be faceless and take days, crypto transactions allow you to track the payment from start to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. You receive information on where the transaction is on the blockchain and its estimated completion time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. While busy networks can cause delays, the ability to monitor your funds provides a sense of financial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

For freelancers, this means getting paid quickly and directly, without the delays of traditional banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. This immediate access to liquid funds allows for better financial organization in a digital society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Platforms like LaborX and related services such as PaymentX (for businesses to pay suppliers globally) facilitate this efficient and transparent payment system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. If you are a freelancer looking into [[getting_paid_with_crypto_on_laborxcom | getting paid with crypto on LaborX.com]] in 2021-2022, it's worth exploring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

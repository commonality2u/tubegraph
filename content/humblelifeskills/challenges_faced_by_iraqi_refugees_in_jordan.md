Since the start of violence and instability in Iraq, two million Iraqis have fled their homeland, with approximately half a million seeking refuge in Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. While some affluent Iraqis have secured official residence permits and established businesses, the vast majority face severe [[living_conditions_and_daily_struggles_of_iraqi_refugees | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Lack of Legal Status and Rights
Most Iraqi refugees in Jordan exist in a "twilight zone" without official status or firm legal rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Many do not possess valid visas, making their presence in Jordan technically illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, and some even lack valid passports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This [[impact_of_lack_of_legal_status_on_iraqi_refugees | lack of legal status]] leaves them stranded; they are too afraid to return to Iraq and unable to travel to other countries that deny ordinary Iraqis entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Without work permits or long-term residence permissions, they are condemned to poverty and reliance on handouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Furthermore, without valid visas, they face the constant threat of deportation back to Iraq at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Economic Hardship and Precarious Employment
The veneer of normality for most refugees is very thin, as their situation is often desperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Many, like a 37-year-old veterinary surgeon from Baghdad who lost five family members in Iraq, survive "hand to mouth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. They resort to working illegally for cut-price pay, with jobs often being temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Employers accept them because they can pay them very little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This precarious income means that even small comforts, like a television and satellite, can take years of work to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Living Conditions and Social Isolation
Unlike traditional refugee images, Iraqis in Jordan are not housed in camps; they integrate into the urban scene, renting flats in cheaper neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. However, their [[living_conditions_and_daily_struggles_of_iraqi_refugees | living conditions]] can be bleak, with many residing in unheated flats in poor suburbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Families struggle with rising rents and electricity bills, trying to stay warm through bitterly cold Middle Eastern winters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Many are dependent on monthly payments from the UNHCR for food and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

A profound aspect of their existence is a chosen "invisibility." Many refugees believe the best way to live in Jordan is to be "invisible and unseen," as it offers a sense of relative safety compared to being visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Fear and Despair
While the immediate physical dangers of Iraq may be left behind, refugees in Jordan still live with profound fear: fear of the police, of each other, of the past, and of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. As years pass and conditions worsen, hope for a better future gives way to despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Many feel they have lost their jobs, their future, and their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Imran Riza, the UNHCR's representative in Amman, notes that the situation is becoming more difficult as refugees' savings run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. He emphasizes the overwhelming lack of [[hopes_and_fears_for_the_future_among_iraqi_refugees | hope]] among them:
> "what they really don't have at the moment when you talk to them is hope. They really do not see where their future is is is lying right now. There's a very high level of despair amongst them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Families, like that of Um Muhammad, a lab technician dreaming of returning to work, desperately want to go back to Iraq but say it's still too dangerous until security for their children is guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## International Response and Ongoing Needs
The international community was slow to react to Iraq's refugee crisis and was in denial about the problem until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. While there has been a "dawning of recognition," governments and aid organizations have struggled to keep up with the on-the-ground realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The UNHCR has led [[efforts_by_jordan_and_international_communities_to_aid_iraqi_refugees | relief efforts]], providing basic humanitarian assistance, food distribution, education, psychological counseling, and emergency cash handouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

Despite these efforts, only a tiny minority (just one percent) of Iraqis on the UNHCR's books are resettled to countries like Europe and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. According to Imran Riza, these efforts have only made conditions "barely tolerable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The challenge remains to maintain focus on the humanitarian element and consolidate the relief efforts, as the situation is a "medium-term" one that will not be resolved in a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The situation is, in fact, becoming more difficult for refugees as their resources deplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

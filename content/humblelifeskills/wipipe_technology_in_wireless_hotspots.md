The Cradlepoint PHS300 is a wireless hotspot router that incorporates "Wipipe technology" to provide portable internet connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This device functions similarly to a home broadband router but is designed to be battery-operated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Features and Connectivity

The [[cradlepoint_phs300_features | Cradlepoint PHS300]] includes a USB connector, enabling the connection of a [[usage_of_3g_dongle_in_cradlepoint | 3G dongle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It also supports an adapter for PCMCIA cards, allowing for the use of EVDO cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Users should consult the Cradlepoint website for an updated list of supported routers and HSPDA connectors, as compatibility is continuously expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Once connected with a SIM-enabled dongle, the device creates a [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | personal wireless hotspot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This setup facilitates [[using_wifi_and_mobile_data_for_connectivity | using WiFi and mobile data for connectivity]], even with international unlimited SIMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Power and Portability

The internal battery of the [[cradlepoint_phs300_features | Cradlepoint PHS300]] provides approximately 3 to 4 hours of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For extended use, the device can be connected to an external power unit, such as a Teon power unit, which can extend its operational time to about a day and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The device accepts a 5-volt DC input for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This portability makes it suitable for [[using_technology_during_travel | travel]] or mobile use.

## Configuration and Security

The Cradlepoint PHS300 features a simple web interface for [[wifi_router_setup | configuration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Through this interface, users can adjust settings such as the Wi-Fi channel and [[security_and_encryption_settings_for_personal_hotspots | encryption type]] (e.g., 64-bit, 128-bit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The personal wireless hotspot can also be password protected for added security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Advanced Features and Updates

Cradlepoint regularly releases firmware updates for the device, which introduce new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. One such feature allows for GPS tracking, enabling the device to continuously broadcast its GPS location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Current Use

The [[cradlepoint_phs300_features | Cradlepoint PHS300]] has been sponsored by Cradlepoint for the Amo box project, with ten units acquired for an upcoming project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

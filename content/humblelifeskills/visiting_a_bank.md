Upon visiting a bank, a customer encountered a waiting period for their appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Appointment and Wait Time

The bank was unable to accommodate the customer immediately, scheduling them for quarter past ten, approximately 15 to 20 minutes from the current time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This allowed for about 20 minutes of waiting time before the scheduled appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The customer anticipated a "mad banking experience" due to the nature of their visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Multiple Account Openings

The purpose of the bank visit involved [[opening_multiple_bank_accounts|opening multiple bank accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Specifically, the customer intended to:
*   Open an account for Ella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   [[starting_a_small_business|Open a business account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Open a community account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Concerns

The customer expressed a concern that the bank might perceive them as a "fraudster" due to the request to [[opening_multiple_bank_accounts|open three bank accounts]] simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

[[challenges_and_opportunities_in_low_impact_development_permitting | Low Impact Development]] (LID) is an approach that seeks a new direction for rural areas by emphasizing labor and design-intensive systems over fossil fuel-intensive ones to enhance land productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This method aims to enable people to live on and intensively tend pieces of land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Core Principles and Practices

Unlike modern farming, which is characterized by being "people scarce but fossil fuel intensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_low_impact_development_permitting | Low Impact Development]] focuses on:
*   **Human-centered approach**: Utilizing "more people power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Design and [[utilizing_natural_resources_for_sustainable_living | natural systems]] understanding**: Incorporating more design and a deeper understanding of how [[utilizing_natural_resources_for_sustainable_living | natural systems]] function to make rural areas more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **[[permaculture_and_sustainable_farming_practices | Permaculture]]**: Employing [[permaculture_and_sustainable_farming_practices | permaculture]] principles alongside simple living practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Policy Framework

The Lambus project, a [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_low_impact_development_permitting | Low Impact Development]] initiative, operates specifically in Pembrokeshire, Wales, as it is currently the only area in Britain with a dedicated [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_low_impact_development_permitting | Low Impact Development]] policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This policy allows for the development and habitation of agricultural land, provided the land is worked for livelihood and all activities are conducted in an ecologically sound manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. There is hope that similar legislation will soon be implemented across Wales and potentially the entire UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Site Selection and Resource Utilization

The Lambus project site was chosen due to significant natural assets:
*   **Spring water**: A reliable source of spring water is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Hydroelectric power**: An existing hydroelectric power plant, fed by an old mill leat built over 150 years ago, requires only minor refurbishment to become operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

A key goal of the project is to demonstrate that [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_low_impact_development_permitting | Low Impact Development]] can be successful not just on prime agricultural land, but also on typical, widely available, and underutilized land, such as elevated grazing land found extensively in Wales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Soil Reconditioning and Productivity

The project aims to improve the land's productivity, particularly its thin topsoil, by:
*   **Resting land**: Removing livestock that have historically overgrazed the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Afforestation**: Planting trees to introduce nutrient cycling into the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Microbial enhancement**: Seeding the soil with mycorrhizal fungi to aid connections between plants and soil elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Organic matter addition**: Building up soil by using green manures, nitrogen-fixing plants, and introducing more organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Composting**: Growing nitrogen-rich shrubs, cutting them, and returning them to the soil through large-scale composting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Trees, such as willows, serve multiple functions within the [[permaculture_and_sustainable_farming_practices | permaculture]] design, including providing firewood, creating windbreaks for microclimates suitable for forest gardens and cereal crops, and offering craft wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Expenditure Priorities and Philosophy

Major group expenditures focus on [[infrastructure_and_resource_management_in_low_impact_communities | infrastructure]] for access, water, and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Individual families prioritize building their dwellings. A key philosophy guiding expenditure is to meet needs (e.g., shelter, warmth) by utilizing resources available on the land, such as wood, clay, and stone, rather than relying on market-provided products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This means primarily investing in tools to create things, rather than purchasing finished products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The project also emphasizes tool-making on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

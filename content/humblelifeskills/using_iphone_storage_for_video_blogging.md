The use of an iPhone, specifically an iPhone 4S, provides a practical solution for [[video_blogging_and_citizen_journalism_with_canon_cameras | video blogging]], particularly when dealing with storage limitations on other devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Advantages of iPhone for Video Blogging

An iPhone on loan, featuring approximately 10 gigabytes of space, is deemed suitable for [[video_blogging_and_citizen_journalism_with_canon_cameras | video blogging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This contrasts with previous experiences where an iPad frequently ran out of storage space, leading to inconsistent video uploads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The iPhone 4S, with its older connector type, is compatible with specific microphone cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Enhancing Audio Quality with External Microphones

To improve audio quality for video blogging, an Apogee mic can be used with the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This setup is considered a good solution for [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | recording personal video blogs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. While potentially useful for interviews with a boom pole, the cable length may be a limiting factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Apogee Mic Connectivity
A custom-made cable with a Lightning connector and the specific Apogee mic connector was imported from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This cable cost around 40 quid and took approximately a month and a half to arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This cable also enables the Apogee mic to be used with an iPad for improved audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

After testing, the Apogee mic appears to work natively with the iPhone's camera app, requiring gain adjustment to prevent over-modulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The audio from the Apogee mic is described as clear and superior to the iPad's built-in microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Utilizing the YouTube Capture App

The [[youtube_capture_app_for_video_editing | YouTube Capture app]] is favored for its video stabilization feature and its ability to edit clips linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This app facilitates a streamlined workflow, allowing users to quickly edit and tag videos for upload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The app's process supports "video editing as you go" while maintaining a "raw, straight out of the camera" feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

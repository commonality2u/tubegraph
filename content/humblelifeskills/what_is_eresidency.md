E-residency is a unique program offered by Estonia, allowing non-residents to obtain a secure digital identity issued by the Estonian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It is regarded as the world's first global digital ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This digital ID is not a physical residency or citizenship; e-residents cannot vote or claim typical residency benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Instead, it functions as a "glorified digital ID digital pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Estonia, a country confident in its technology, already uses this digital ID system for its own citizens for various purposes, including buses, tracking, and encryption documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Motivation for E-Residency

The concept of e-residency is largely driven by the rise of [[advantages_of_eresidency_for_digital_nomads | digital nomads]] and location-independent work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It addresses the potential issue of countries losing their skilled [[eresidency_and_its_implications_for_global_talent | talent]] to global opportunities by allowing individuals to maintain a formal connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Estonia views it as a "smart power move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, leveraging a "first mover advantage" as the pioneer of a global digital ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

Crowdsourcing platforms that do not have an end date for projects are being explored as a method for [[funding_and_sponsorship_for_independent_projects | funding and sponsorship for independent projects]] [00:00:24]. This approach aims to create a [[funding_and_sponsorship_for_independent_projects | sustainable cash flow]] for future projects [00:02:59] and advocacy work [00:02:00].

## Challenges with Time-Limited Crowdfunding

Previous attempts at crowdfunding highlighted difficulties in how to [[challenges_of_maintaining_a_crowdfunding_campaign | maintain the campaign]] and drive it effectively [00:00:58]. Maintaining momentum and communication with supporters is crucial for a successful campaign [00:01:09].

Many crowdfunding sites, particularly Kickstarter, are very time-limited [00:01:18]. This creates significant pressure to achieve goals by a certain date [00:01:21], which can be suitable for product development but less so for abstract ideas or supplementary projects [00:01:29]. The requirement to offer [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | incentives and perks]] and adhere to a strict timeline can be debilitating [00:01:39].

## A Flexible Crowdfunding Model

A potential solution involves using platforms that allow for ongoing, flexible contributions, contrasting with the [[differences_between_timelimited_and_flexible_crowdfunding_platforms | differences between timelimited and flexible crowdfunding platforms]] [00:00:26]. One such site mentioned is "WeFoundThis" (possibly GoFundMe, as mentioned later) [00:01:47], which allows users to set a desired funding figure without an end date and integrates with [[social_media_interaction_and_community_engagement | social media tools]] [00:01:51].

### Implementing Sustainable Funding

The concept is to integrate project payments into an ongoing fund. For instance, clients might be offered a discounted rate for services if their payment contributes to this fund, rather than a direct, full-price payment [00:02:26].

This method provides several benefits:
*   It encourages clients to view the project differently, offering a saving while also generating interest in the underlying advocacy project [00:02:41].
*   Clients might share their positive experience on social media, further promoting the project [00:02:50].
*   It helps fund independent projects that might otherwise be difficult to finance [00:02:22].
*   It provides transparency, allowing contributors to see where their money went and what has been achieved [00:03:30]. This direct contact adds a "social layer" to the funding [00:03:42].

### Project Example: Land in Spain

An example of an advocacy project that could benefit from this model is acquiring land in Spain to host events [00:03:49]. The idea is to raise money for two hectares of land with planning permission [00:03:52]. Once acquired, a shipping container would be placed on the land, and those who sponsored the land could be invited to a free TEDx event [00:04:03].

### Perks and Incentives in a Flexible Model

Even with a flexible, ongoing model, [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | incentives and perks]] can still be offered [00:04:16]. For example, a client who pays their fee and adds an extra donation could receive an invitation to visit the project site once it's realized, with their travel expenses covered [00:04:26]. This helps maintain [[social_media_interaction_and_community_engagement | customer attention]] and engagement [00:04:42].

## GoFundMe as an Alternative

While platforms like Kickstarter are still being considered for specific products, GoFundMe is suggested as a viable option for those seeking crowdfunding tools that do not require an end date or the immediate creation of numerous [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | perks]] [00:04:47]. The [[advantages_of_using_gofundme_over_kickstarter | advantages of using GoFundMe over Kickstarter]] for such projects include its flexible nature [00:04:58].

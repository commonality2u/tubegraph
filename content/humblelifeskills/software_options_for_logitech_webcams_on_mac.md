When [[using_logitech_c920_webcam_on_a_mac | using Logitech webcams]] like the [[logitech_c920_and_c930e_camera_settings | C920]], [[logitech_c920_and_c930e_camera_settings | C930e]], or [[using_logitech_brio_4k_webcam | Brio 4K]] on a Mac, specific software is available to adjust settings and optimize video quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Native Logitech Software

While there are third-party apps available on the App Store, the native software provided by Logitech is generally considered more than sufficient for most needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Obtaining the Software

It can be difficult to find the direct download for the [[webcam_settings_app_for_logitech_c920 | C920 webcam settings software]] by simply searching Logitech's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A direct link to access the necessary software is `support.logi.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The software version running on the speaker's setup is available via this link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The download for the [[logitech_c920_and_c930e_camera_settings | C930e]] version is often easier to locate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Recommended Settings

Optimal settings for Logitech webcams often involve adjusting light and color to achieve the best image quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The speaker uses two LED lights positioned about half a meter from their face, set to daylight mode (5600 Kelvin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Home Page Settings

*   **Images:** Widescreen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Anti-Flicker:** Set to PAL 50Hz for Europe; in the States, 60Hz is typical due to power and lighting systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **HDR:** Can be kept on, though it may not significantly impact the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Field of View:** 78 degrees is recommended for a closer shot, though 90 degrees offers a wider view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Advanced Settings

These settings are crucial for achieving good tones and can be adjusted based on your specific lighting setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

*   **Brightness:** Dialed down to 40 to avoid blowing out the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Color Intensity:** Set to 38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Contrast:** Set to 45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Auto White Balance:** This setting should generally be turned **off** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Auto white balance can cause colors to change drastically or look washed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   Instead, manually set the white balance as close to 5600 Kelvin as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. In the app, it may only allow setting to 5599 Kelvin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Focus and Tracking

*   **Tracking:** The tracking on these webcams is not as advanced as a DSLR with face-tracking capabilities; it often relies on light-based "true light" settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Autofocus:** While autofocus is available, it's recommended to manually trigger the focus before recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   Click on the autofocus setting in the app to get the camera to focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   Then, turn off autofocus for the duration of the recording unless you anticipate significant movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   The most impactful settings to [[manual_focus_and_settings_adjustment_for_webcams | play around with]] are autofocus and auto white balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Troubleshooting and Refinement

To find the best settings for your specific setup, it's advised to:

*   Review footage on a decent monitor, such as a Retina display, to accurately assess color likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   Tinker with the color intensity, contrast, and brightness settings until desired tones are achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Brightness should not be too high to avoid washing out the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

The speaker originally created a video to document these settings due to forgetting them and difficulty finding the software file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Further details on [[optimal_lighting_settings_for_webcam_setups | LED lights]] and other equipment (green screen, microphone) used in the speaker's setup can be found in the video description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The Archos device, specifically the [[Archos AV500 features and functionality | Archos AV500]], is positioned as a superior portable media player compared to others available on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The speaker chose the Archos after reviewing various options based on screens, sound quality, and disk space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Screen Quality
The [[Archos AV500 features and functionality | Archos AV500]] features a 16x9 screen format with very good definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
In [[Comparison of Archos with competing media players | comparison]] to devices like the Zen and the iPod Video, the Archos's screen "completely outstrips" the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Even a new Video iPod, which was rumored to be touch-sensitive and 16x9, did not yet offer what the Archos already had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## [[Storage capabilities of the Archos AV500 | Storage Capacity]]
The specific Archos model discussed has a 100GB hard drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The speaker notes that it's difficult for competitors like Apple to release a device with a similar or larger hard drive capacity, though 120GB 2.5-inch drives and even 200GB drives were emerging in some Far East countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The 30GB model of the Archos was observed retailing for around $300-$350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Battery Life
The [[Archos AV500 features and functionality | Archos AV500]] is highlighted for its battery longevity, lasting 5 hours on a single charge, which is considered superior to other market options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Additional Functionality
Unlike many competitors, the [[Archos AV500 features and functionality | Archos AV500]] offers significant additional features:
*   **External Drive Functionality** The device functions as a USB 2.0 external drive, appearing as a caddy when plugged into a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. It is compatible with both [[Compatibility of Archos devices with Windows | Windows]] and Mac operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Digital Video Recorder (DVR)** A key differentiating feature is its built-in DVR capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. It can connect directly to cable or digital set-top boxes (like Sky in the UK) and allows users to schedule and record programs without tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Direct Camera Input** The Archos can directly connect to high-definition cameras (8-9 megapixels, shooting in RAW) via a USB cable to transfer photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This provides a portable storage solution for photographers, avoiding the rapid filling of SD or CompactFlash cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Optional Camera Accessory** An optional Sony CCD camera accessory, priced at approximately Â£40 UK (just under $300 USD), can be plugged into the Archos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This transforms the device into a video recorder, capable of storing 14 hours of real-time direct-encoded MP4 video on an empty 100GB hard drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This feature is particularly recommended for video casters or those doing "out of bounds" video, such as mountain biking or sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This [[Comparison to other cameras and camcorders | capability to record directly]] makes it stand out from other media players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

The speaker highly recommends the [[Archos AV500 features and functionality | Archos AV500]] due to its comprehensive features and capabilities, especially its screen quality, storage, battery life, and DVR/camera input options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

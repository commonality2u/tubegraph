Living an [[living_an_amazing_life | amazing life]] may not be what people typically imagine, such as relaxing on a beach or riding a yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. For some, an [[living_an_amazing_life | amazing life]] involves being in control of their work, being their own boss, and doing what they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>. This often means thinking about work non-stop, but it is balanced by actively unplugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:19">[02:47:19]</a>.

## Defining Your Amazing Life

The speaker shared a busy week that he considered amazing:
*   **Monday:** His wife was in a minor car accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.
*   **Tuesday:** His new book arrived, which he described as similar to having a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
*   **Wednesday:** He publicly announced his new company, which he founded as a goal to make real by his book's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. He also baked five pies for Thanksgiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   **Thursday:** Hosted Thanksgiving for relatives and did all the cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>.
*   **Friday:** Woke up at 3 AM, flew from JFK to Heathrow, and arrived at his hotel at 1 AM before presenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:07">[01:46:07]</a>.

He considers this week amazing because he was in control and was doing what he loved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:19">[02:07:19]</a>.

## Pursuing Passion and Career Control

While a nine-to-five job is not inherently wrong if it's the right fit, slaving away and hating every minute will eventually "eat away at you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:19">[03:39:19]</a>. The world is full of opportunities for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. The speaker himself left a secure, high-paying college job in 2006 because a project didn't go as planned, despite having two young kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. He found a new job overnight by simply emailing a friend who was starting a business and wanted him involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:15">[04:53:15]</a>.

Later, in 2008, while putting a down payment on a new house as the mortgage industry was collapsing, he decided to leave that company as well, telling his wife he would do freelance work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. His wife's response, "You haven't let me down yet, don't start now," highlighted the pressure but also the belief in his ability to create his own path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

### "Passion Hits"

The speaker coined the term "passion hits" to describe someone who has found a way to do what they love and turn it into a livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Becoming a "passion hit" is never easy, and there will be doubters, including parents, best friends, and partners, who question your choices because an [[living_an_amazing_life | amazing life]] is not the easy one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. However, there is a community of people who want to help you be happy, even if you haven't met them yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## Family, Unplugging, and Leading by Example

Family is a significant motivator for working hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. The speaker emphasized that he couldn't do what he does without his wife, who is his best friend and enables him to pursue his endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. It's important to lead by example for your children and family, pursuing the life you want to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

Even when working non-stop, it's crucial to balance it out with unplugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Despite being a technology enthusiast, the speaker advises turning off devices and getting outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. He observes families sitting together but everyone is on a device, advocating for real-world connections over digital ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. He calls these "beer and coffee" moments, where sitting down over coffee with one person or having a beer after an event creates truly amazing experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:13">[12:04:13]</a>.

## The Role of Technology

Technology can greatly assist in living an [[living_an_amazing_life | amazing life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. The speaker has worked from home for six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a> and ran a marketing agency with a business partner located in a different state, not meeting face-to-face for the first three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. This highlights the [[differences_between_virtual_work_and_traditional_jobs | empowering nature of virtual work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

The concept of "work shifting" allows individuals to work from anywhere as long as they have an internet connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. Even for those in traditional office jobs, specific tasks can be done remotely to improve sanity, whether from home, a park bench, or anywhere outside the cubicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. This flexibility is a key aspect of the [[digital_nomad_lifestyle | digital nomad lifestyle]] and modern work.

## The Importance of Giving Back

A crucial part of living an [[living_an_amazing_life | amazing life]] and achieving happiness is to [[importance_of_community_and_giving_back | give back]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. This doesn't just mean donating money, which is easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. Instead, it means giving your time, experience, and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. It is a "human duty" to contribute, especially given the opportunities in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

The speaker's perspective on [[volunteer_work_and_community_involvement | giving back]] was profoundly impacted by a trip to Ghana with the ONE Campaign, where he witnessed the potential and happiness of children despite challenging circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. He met university students determined to stay and improve their country, demonstrating national pride and a desire to contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.

Whether it's volunteering at a soup kitchen or organizing a coat drive, taking the time to [[importance_of_community_and_giving_back | give back]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. Hard work, kindness to others, and helping everyone out are key to experiencing amazing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

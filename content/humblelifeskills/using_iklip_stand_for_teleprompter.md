The [[iklip_microphone_stand_overview|iKlip microphone standard adapter]] for iPad 1 and 2 is designed to hold an iPad, enabling its use as a teleprompter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Setup and Functionality
To set up the [[iklip_microphone_stand_overview|iKlip]] for teleprompting, the iPad is secured in the adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Notes created in Apple Pages, which are supported by iCloud, can be used for the teleprompter content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This allows the user to step through different notes while recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The iPad can be positioned directly up to the camera lens, effectively functioning as a teleprompter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This setup is noted to make recording much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Limitations
A drawback of the [[iklip_microphone_stand_overview|iKlip]]'s design is that it cannot transition to landscape orientation without unscrewing a bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The [[gopro_hero_3_black_edition_features | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] has been noted for significant battery reliability problems, which have prevented its consistent use since purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

## Symptoms and Observations

The primary issues observed with the standard battery include:
*   **Inconsistent Battery Life** The battery supplied with the camera is "incredibly unreliable," with runtimes varying significantly from half an hour to an hour and a half, rarely reaching two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
*   **[[overheating_problems_with_gopro_cameras | Overheating]]** The battery gets "extremely hot" during use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. This [[overheating_problems_with_gopro_cameras | overheating]] can cause the entire camera to lock up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.
*   **Locking Up** The camera can lock up due to heat from the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.

It is speculated that GoPro may have primarily focused on developing their cameras for cold environments, such as surfing or snowboarding, where [[gopro_usage_in_various_environments_and_conditions | battery performance in colder conditions]] might differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This raises concerns about battery performance in [[gopro_usage_in_various_environments_and_conditions | hotter climates or usage conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Troubleshooting and User Inquiry

An alternative Wasabi Power battery, with specifications of 3.7 volts, 1200 milliamps, and 4.4 watt-hours, was acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This replacement battery will be charged and tested to determine if the issue is with the original battery or a broader camera fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. The camera also has the latest firmware installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] User Inquiry:
> There is an open question to [[user_experiences_with_gopro_hero_3_plus_batteries | GoPro Hero 3 Plus Edition]] owners regarding whether the [[user_experiences_with_gopro_hero_3_plus_batteries | GoPro 3 Plus]] offers improved battery reliability and if the problem has been resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Users with experience addressing these battery issues for the [[gopro_hero_3_black_edition_features | GoPro 3 Black Edition]] are encouraged to share their solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

## Impact on Usage

The unreliable battery performance hinders the camera's intended use, particularly for setting up shots in a green screen shower, where its wide-angle capabilities are desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Attempts to integrate the GoPro with a Blackmagic Intensity device via [[hdmi_output_from_gopro_hero_3 | HDMI]] have also been problematic due to the camera locking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Potential Solutions

One potential solution involves a third-party external power pack, available for approximately $60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This pack plugs into the GoPro and allows it to run on [[alternatives_to_internal_batteries_for_gopro | main power]], thereby bypassing the internal battery and mitigating [[overheating_problems_with_gopro_cameras | battery overheating]] and charging concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This external power option is expected to provide better uptime and prevent the camera from locking up due to heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

As of January 2nd, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, the speaker is very focused on creating content for YouTube and Udemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Internet Data Usage and Costs
A significant challenge noted is the rapid consumption of internet data, with 10 gigabytes used in 8 days for browsing and watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This weekly data consumption of 10GB costs £30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. To make data usage more cost-effective for content creation and distribution, the speaker plans to switch to a monthly tariff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. A 50GB 4G plan for £50 per month is being considered as a more economical option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Content Strategy: Video to Blog Posts
The speaker draws inspiration from Udemy courses that use offline downloading and translation for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. A key strategy involves translating video content into written blog posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

This process includes:
*   **Transcribing and Translating**: Having someone extract or translate the text from videos into English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Blogging from Speech**: The idea that "as long as you can talk, you can blog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Utilizing Services**: The speaker plans to use [[using_cambly_vidmob_and_fiverr_for_income | Fiverr]] for this transcription and translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **SEO Optimization**: Focusing on creating long posts (2,000 words or more) as Google favors such content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Content Distribution**: Uploading the YouTube video with the transcribed or translated text placed underneath it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

This content creation approach will be a primary focus for the speaker over the next couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

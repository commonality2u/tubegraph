## The Allure of Threadless and T-Shirt Addiction

A speaker recounts a strong affection for T-shirts, specifically highlighting various colors like green, blue, brown, black, and yellow, and their origin from the brand Threadless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This appreciation escalated into an [[tshirt_addiction | addiction]] to purchasing these items online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Ease and Impact of Online Shopping

The process of acquiring new shirts became effortless, described as simply "click[ing] the page" and ordering without full realization of the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This ease contributed to the [[online_shopping_addiction | addiction]], making it too much to handle with just "three clicks" to complete a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This demonstrates how [[technological_advancements_and_their_impact | technological advancements]] in online retail can facilitate unchecked consumerism.

## Escalation of Spending Habits

Initially, purchasing T-shirts was managed, with the speaker buying "normal t-shirts" and feeling in control, without the need to buy "10 at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. However, this changed, and the purchasing became "so addictive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The habit spiraled to the point where the individual accumulated 50 shirts, necessitating the purchase of a new cupboard, indicating the situation was "getting out of hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Financial Strain and Sacrifices

The consequences of this excessive spending included additional customs duty, an extra cost of Â£20 to receive the items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. To cover these expenses, money had to be found, leading to severe personal sacrifice; in some weeks, the individual "wouldn't eat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This highlights the severe impact on [[managing_spending_habits | managing spending habits]] and personal well-being, touching upon issues akin to [[food_poverty_and_community_impact | food poverty]].

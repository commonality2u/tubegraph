Using a GoPro with a Blackmagic Intensity capture device allows for significant flexibility in video input, but often requires adjustments to achieve optimal color balance and gamma settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Connecting GoPro to Blackmagic Intensity

The GoPro can be connected to the [[using_blackmagic_capture_and_editing_software_with_gopro|Blackmagic Intensity Extreme]] using its tiny HDMI out cable, which then connects to the HDMI IN port of the capture device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The GoPro Hero3, for example, features this small HDMI output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The [[using_blackmagic_capture_and_editing_software_with_gopro|Blackmagic Intensity Extreme]] is powered by Thunderbolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The device typically comes with a breakout cable that provides various connection options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Once connected, the GoPro appears as an input within capture software like Wirecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Adjusting Video Quality and Color

### Raw Camera Output
When captured directly, the video feed from a GoPro is often "raw," meaning it lacks any applied effects or processing from the camera itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This raw input may not have optimal color balance or gamma settings right out of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Comparison to [[logitech_c920_and_c930e_camera_settings|Logitech C920]]
A [[logitech_c920_and_c930e_camera_settings|Logitech C920]] webcam can offer very good quality in terms of color balance and gamma compared to bringing in another video source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, with some tinkering, the GoPro's colors can also be adjusted to an optimal state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Software Adjustments for Color and Gamma
To improve the captured video's appearance, software settings can be used to adjust the color balance and gamma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For example, within Wirecast, users can utilize built-in settings to scale the video and modify the gamma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. With these adjustments, the output quality can become "pretty good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The [[using_blackmagic_capture_and_editing_software_with_gopro|Blackmagic]] company also provides its own capture and editing software that works seamlessly with their devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

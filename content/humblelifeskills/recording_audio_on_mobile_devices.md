## Blue Mikey Microphone

The Blue Mikey is a portable microphone designed for mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

### Features
The Blue Mikey includes a positional stand, allowing it to be set in different orientations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, such as standing up or pointing towards a speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. It offers three sensitivity settings: very quiet, medium, and high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A small switch on the back controls these settings, though it appears somewhat fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Manufactured by Blue Microphones, known for producing quality microphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, the Blue Mikey typically costs around 60-70 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Compatibility
The Blue Mikey plugs into the bottom of an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> and works natively with the iPod Touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While not intended to work on an iPhone 3G without specific software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, it can be used with an iPhone 3G when the Fire application is loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Plugging the microphone into an iPhone without the Fire application can result in an undesirable noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Usage with Fire Application
The Fire application is crucial for detecting and utilizing the Blue Mikey on compatible iPhones, such as the iPhone 3G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. When the microphone is plugged in, the application will prompt the user and then detect the microphone's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Advantages for Field Recording
The Blue Mikey is highly sensitive, capable of picking up voices from approximately a meter away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This sensitivity makes it ideal for interviews and other recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The Fire application enables users to make numerous recordings on the iPhone without immediately sending or uploading the files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This feature is particularly beneficial for conducting multiple interviews or recordings in succession without requiring a data or broadband connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

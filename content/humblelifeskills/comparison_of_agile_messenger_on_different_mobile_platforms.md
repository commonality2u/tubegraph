[[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Agile Messenger]] is a chat client designed to connect to multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>. Its performance and functionality, however, vary significantly across different mobile operating systems.

## Agile Messenger on Symbian (Nokia N80)

On a [[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Nokia N80]] running Symbian, [[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Agile Messenger]] generally performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

### Setup and Connectivity
[[setting_up_agile_messenger_on_symbian_phones | Setting up Agile Messenger]] involves configuring internet access points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. While the [[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Nokia N80]] is a Wi-Fi phone, connection can also be established through 3G mobile data, though this may take slightly longer due to negotiation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

### Supported Networks and Features
Agile Messenger on Symbian supports connections to multiple networks, including:
*   ICQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>
*   AOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>
*   Yahoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>
*   Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>
*   MSN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>

One of its key [[features_of_agile_messenger_for_messaging_and_media_sharing | features]] is the ability to connect to more than one network simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
The application can also integrate with the phone's capabilities, such as sending messages to a Twitter feed via the chat client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Users can also directly send images by taking a photo within the application and sending it as a file transfer to a contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This functionality is compatible with clients like MSN and potentially Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### Performance and Usability
[[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Agile Messenger]] can run in the background, consuming minimal data when not actively sending messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. It also offers an "auto connect on start" option, allowing it to connect to all chat clients automatically when the phone is turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Agile Messenger on Windows Mobile 5 (Dash)

In contrast, [[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Agile Messenger]] appears to have significant issues when running on Windows Mobile 5 devices, specifically the "Dash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

The application "doesn't seem to be working very good" on the Dash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, leading to the assessment that it is "suckage on Windows Mobile 5" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Users are advised against installing it on a Dash as it "seems to be barking up dashes right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. There is hope that future versions for Windows Mobile 5 will address these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

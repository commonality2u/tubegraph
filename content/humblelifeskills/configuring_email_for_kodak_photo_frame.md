The Kodak Pulse photo frame, located in the studio, is designed to cycle through photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Initially, it was not cycling due to an issue with [[connecting_photo_frame_to_a_wireless_network | connecting the photo frame to a wireless network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Receiving Photos via Email

An innovative idea is to leverage the [[setting_up_a_kodak_pulse_photo_frame | Kodak Pulse photo frame's]] built-in email address to receive pictures directly from Instagram users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This functionality allows the photo frame to display a continuous stream of photos, offering a "snippet of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. By sending photos directly to the frame, manual browsing of Instagram is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The photo frame may be repositioned in the studio for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Configuring Instagram to Send Photos

To send photos from Instagram to the Kodak Pulse photo frame:

1.  **Take a Photo**: Capture a photo using Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Filters can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
2.  **Select Sharing Options**: When prompted to share, navigate through the various sharing options such as Twitter and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
3.  **Choose Email**: Select the "email" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. If not immediately visible, tap "show more" to reveal additional options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
4.  **Configure Email Address**:
    *   Tap to configure the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   Add a new email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   The specific email address for the photo frame is `Instagram@Kodakps.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
5.  **Send Photo**: Once the email address is configured (indicated by a green tick) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, proceed to share the picture. A copy of the photo will be sent to the photo frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This process allows [[using_instagram_to_send_photos_via_email | using Instagram to send photos via email]] directly to the frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## GoPro Usage in Various Environments and Conditions

The [[GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] has been noted for significant [[GoPro Hero 3 battery reliability issues | battery reliability]] issues, particularly in warmer conditions, which impacts its general usability.

### Battery Reliability and Overheating

A primary concern with the [[GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] is the unreliability of its internal battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Battery life can vary significantly, ranging from half an hour to an hour and a half, instead of the expected two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The battery is also prone to getting "extremely hot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, which can lead to the camera locking up due to heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Intended vs. Observed Usage Environments

The popularity of GoPro cameras is widely attributed to their use in cold environments, such as surfing or snowboarding, where they were likely designed and redeveloped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. However, there is concern that in "hotter climates or like in hotter usage conditions," the batteries are not as efficient, tend to overheat, or experience other issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Addressing Battery Issues

Investigations into battery reliability include:
*   **Testing replacement batteries** A Wasabi Power battery (3.7 volts, 1200 milliamps, 4.4 watt-hours) designed to replace the original Hero 3 battery was found and is planned to be charged and tested to determine if the fault lies with the battery or the camera itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Seeking [[User experiences with GoPro Hero 3 Plus batteries | user experiences]]** Questions have been raised regarding whether the [[GoPro Hero 3 Plus Edition]] has improved battery reliability and if the overheating problem has been resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **[[Alternatives to internal batteries for GoPro | External power solutions]]** An accessory costing approximately $60 can be installed into the GoPro to run it off main power, bypassing the internal battery and eliminating overheating or charging issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. This solution is expected to offer better uptime by preventing the camera from locking up due to heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

Despite the battery concerns, the GoPro Hero 3 is still considered for use in applications such as a green screen shower setup due to its wide-angle capabilities, which can be adjusted to medium or narrow, and its ability to capture macro or super-wide shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. However, relying on it has been difficult because the batteries tend to overheat and lock up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

The [[GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] has also been used with a [[using_gopro_with_blackmagic_intensity_extreme | Blackmagic Intensity Extreme]] as an HDMI input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The latest firmware has been installed in an attempt to mitigate these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

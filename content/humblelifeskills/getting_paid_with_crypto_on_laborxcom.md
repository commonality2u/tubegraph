LaborX.com simplifies the process of receiving payments in cryptocurrency, even for users new to crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The platform aims to make it easy to use and understand the benefits of crypto payments, including converting them into other currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Receiving Payments on LaborX

After a job is completed, the funds, which were previously held in escrow, are released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The payment is then added to the freelancer's wallet within LaborX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## [[freelancing_and_reputation_system_on_laborxcom | Reputation System]]

Completing jobs on LaborX contributes to a user's reputation score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This score is based on reviews, completed contracts, and profile completeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. A higher score increases visibility in the "browse gigs" section, making it a simple algorithmic way to improve a freelancer's standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The more work done, the faster it's completed, and fewer disputes contribute to a better score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Withdrawing Funds

LaborX provides a clear withdrawal process for crypto earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
Users can view their wallet balance, typically in USDT (Tether), which is on the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. To withdraw or transact with USDT, a balance of Ethereum (ETH) is required in the account to cover "gas" fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Understanding Crypto Transaction Fees and Gas Prices

LaborX includes an in-app calculator for gas prices, allowing users to choose between different speed options or set an advanced custom price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. If the custom price is too low, the transaction will take a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Alternatively, users can check current gas prices on external sites like gasstation.info <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. It's recommended to hold an Ethereum balance as ETH is used to fund transactions, especially when converting ERC20 tokens from one cryptocurrency to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Transaction Transparency

LaborX offers a clear view of completed jobs, showing the income amount and providing direct links to the Ethereum blockchain transaction via Etherscan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This allows users to see every detail of the public transaction, including when it occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This transparency is a significant advantage for freelancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Future improvements could include the ability to collect all annual job records into a PDF for tax purposes or integrate with accounting software like Xero or PaymentX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## [[premium_account_benefits_and_time_tokens_on_laborxcom | Premium Account Benefits]]

LaborX offers a premium account with several [[premium_account_benefits_and_time_tokens_on_laborxcom | benefits]]:
*   **Zero Fees**: Freelancers save 5% and customers save 1% on any contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Cashback**: 1% of the contract amount is returned to the user's wallet after the contract ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Increased Visibility**: Premium account holders receive a badge and appear higher in the "browse gigs" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

To obtain a premium account, users need to hold and deposit 150 TIME tokens to their connected wallet, often via MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. TIME tokens can be purchased on the Timex exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, KuCoin (with BTC/USDT/TIME pairs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, or UniSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Using crypto for payments, particularly for [[earning_money_through_online_platforms | earning money through online platforms]] like LaborX, offers significant [[benefits_of_using_crypto_payments | advantages]]:
*   **Speed and Accessibility**: Payments can be received directly into an account, often within a few days for a project, providing immediate financial control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This contrasts with traditional banking, which can take days, or physical checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Security**: Crypto transactions are publicly traceable from start to finish on the blockchain, unlike faceless bank payments, offering greater mental security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Financial Control**: Users have direct control over their assets, making them feel tangible and providing the ability to move funds as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Global Transactions**: Platforms like LaborX, Timex (their exchange), and PaymentX (for businesses to pay global suppliers) facilitate international payments without extensive paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

For freelancers looking to get paid in crypto, LaborX is a recommended platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

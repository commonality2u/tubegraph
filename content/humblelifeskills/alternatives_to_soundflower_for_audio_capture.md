For users aiming to capture virtual audio on a Mac, particularly those on a budget or using a Big Sur or [[mac_m1_chip | M1 Mac]] in 2021, traditional methods like Soundflower have become unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Decline of Soundflower

Soundflower was formerly a popular open-source kernel extension for [[capturing_systemwide_audio_on_mac | capturing systemwide audio on Mac]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, due to continuous changes in how macOS handles and captures audio with each new operating system version, Soundflower often resulted in buggy software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The project officially ended in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Software Alternatives for Audio Capture

### Rogue Amoeba Loopback

Rogue Amoeba offers a software called Loopback, which provides a powerful and graphical interface for routing audio from various applications, games, or background audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While considered expensive, its user-friendly design makes it accessible even for non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Rogue Amoeba is highly recommended for anyone involved in podcasting or general audio work on Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Original IShowU Audio Capture

Another utility that emerged as Soundflower became problematic was [[ishowu_audio_capture_and_its_features | IShowU Audio Capture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. However, finding and using its specific driver became increasingly difficult, particularly with new macOS versions like Catalina, as the way macOS hooks into its core audio subsystem changes frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### IShowU Instant with SWB Audio Capture

The company behind the original IShowU Audio Capture now offers a highly recommended solution called **IShowU Instant**. This screen recorder is [[screenflow_and_swb_audio_capture_for_m1_mac | Big Sur and M1 Mac ready]], offering a native Apple-ready experience with improved system resource management for potentially higher frame rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Key features and benefits of IShowU Instant:
*   **Cost-Effective** For approximately $24, it provides both a screen capture utility and the essential audio driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Integrated Audio Driver** Upon installation, IShowU Instant automatically installs the "SWB Audio Capture" driver, which appears as an audio device in system settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This driver enables the capture and routing of virtual audio (game audio, music, background sounds) into applications like Zoom, Microsoft Meet, or OBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Advanced Features (Optional)** For an additional $15, an advanced version offers:
    *   [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | Capture from iOS devices]] (iPad, iPhone) via a Lightning cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
    *   Multi-channel audio support, allowing the routing of various audio sources from the system during screen capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Screen Recording Capabilities**
    *   Simple layout with customizable presets for different recording scenarios (local, gaming, YouTube direct upload) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   Custom input frame rates up to 60fps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   Visual features like repositionable webcam screen, visualizing key presses, showing modifiers, and click sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Text watermarks and background customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   Output frame rate matching input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   Direct sharing of recordings to Messages, Notes, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **[[enhancing_audio_with_screenflow | Audio Enhancement Features]]**
    *   Built-in compressor to prevent audio distortion and maintain levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   Graphic EQ for audio adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

For users seeking to capture virtual audio on modern macOS versions, IShowU Instant and its integrated SWB Audio Capture driver are highly recommended as a reliable and up-to-date solution, especially for Big Sur and M1 processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

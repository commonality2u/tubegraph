[[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | Signing]] documents digitally with an [[estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card | Estonian digital ID card]] is a straightforward process [00:02:06]. This method leverages the encryption of the [[estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card | Estonian digital ID card]] for [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | e-residency]], enabling users to [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | digitally sign]] documents as if they were signing something in person [00:02:08] [00:02:10] [00:02:12] [00:02:15].

## The DigiDoc3 Application

The primary application used for [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | digital signing]] is called DigiDoc3 [00:00:01] [00:00:03].

### [[process_of_digitally_signing_multiple_documents | Process of Digitally Signing Multiple Documents]]

1.  **Loading Documents**: Documents, such as those in .docx format, are loaded into the DigiDoc3 application [00:00:10] [00:00:12]. The system allows for [[process_of_digitally_signing_multiple_documents | bulk]] loading of documents for [[process_of_digitally_signing_multiple_documents | signing]] [00:00:13].
2.  **Output Folder Selection**: Users are prompted to specify an output folder where the signed documents will be saved [00:00:15] [00:00:17].
3.  **PIN 1 for Authentication**: To begin the [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | digital signature]] process, users must enter their PIN 1 code, which is used for digital authentication [00:00:25] [00:00:27].
4.  **PIN 2 for Signing**: The actual [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | digital signing]] of documents requires the entry of PIN 2 [00:00:30] [00:00:53].
5.  **Signature Limit**: The system allows for up to 10 [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | digital signatures]] per month [00:00:36] [00:00:39].

### The [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc File Format]]

Signed documents are saved in a format known as [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] [00:00:18]. This [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] format is the default [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | digital signature]] format in [[estonias_digital_id_system | Estonia]] [00:00:31] [00:00:32].

When [[process_of_digitally_signing_multiple_documents | batch signing]] multiple documents, the DigiDoc3 application creates a single [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] file [00:01:58]. This single [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] file functions like a zip file, containing the content of all the signed documents within it, which helps to reduce the overall file size [00:01:43] [00:01:53] [00:01:55] [00:01:59] [00:02:01].

### Outcome of [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | Digital Signing]]

Upon successful completion of the [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | signing]] process, the application confirms that the documents have been signed, indicates the date of signing, and verifies that the signature is valid [00:01:17] [00:01:20] [00:01:22]. The entire process is described as "super super easy" [00:02:06].

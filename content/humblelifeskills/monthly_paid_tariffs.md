Transitioning to a monthly paid tariff for mobile data is being considered due to high weekly costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The current [[mobile_data_usage_and_costs | mobile data usage and costs]] are proving to be expensive, making a monthly plan a potentially cheaper alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Current Data Usage & Costs

Initially, 10 GB of data was used within 8 days, costing £30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This usage primarily involved browsing and watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The cost of £30 per week is considered expensive if it continues on a regular basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Proposed Monthly Plan

Information gathered from an "e operatives" store suggests a monthly plan option:
*   **Cost:** £50 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Data Allowance:** 50 GB 4G data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This plan is considered "not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, especially given that 10 GB per week was costing £30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Such a plan could also be beneficial for an upcoming business venture that might require significant data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, implying relevance to [[managing_data_usage_for_digital_nomads | managing data usage for digital nomads]].

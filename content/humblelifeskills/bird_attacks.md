An instance of a bird attack was observed, resulting in severe injuries to a domesticated bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Attack and Injuries

The bird was found to be "absolutely mutilated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, with some of its feathers having been "ripped out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It was actively bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> and appeared to be in pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The bird was very scared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. It is believed the bird may have escaped from somewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Suspected Predator

A crow was identified as a potential predator that "would have had him to bits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, highlighting the dangers birds face from [[bird_safety_from_predators | predators]].

## Bird Trauma and Stress

There was significant concern that the bird was [[dealing_with_bird_trauma | traumatized]] by the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, noting that a traumatized bird could potentially die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. [[Stress in domesticated birds | Stress]] "really affects them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The bird was observed appearing to try and go to sleep, potentially believing it was safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Care for Injured Bird

The injured bird was taken in for care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

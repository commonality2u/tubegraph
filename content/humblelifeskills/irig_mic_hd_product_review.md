The iRig Mic HD is a digital microphone designed for mobile recording, costing approximately 80 UK Pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It supports various apps, including Vocal Live, iRig Recorder, Amplitube, Easy Voice, and GarageBand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The microphone is compatible with iOS devices, Mac, PC, Windows, iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. It features a precision multi-colored LED indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Why it was purchased

The iRig Mic HD was acquired specifically after observing Steve Garfield at South by Southwest (SXSW) advocating for Meerkat, a live streaming app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The user noted the emergence of live streaming apps like Meerkat and Periscope, attributing their popularity to one-click streaming and deep integration with Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The timing of Twitter's widespread adoption among non-technical users and celebrities also contributed to the appeal of these platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## [[unboxing_and_initial_impressions_of_irig_mic_hd | Unboxing and Initial Impressions]]

The iRig Mic HD was unboxed after being kept in its packaging for about two weeks, even traveling to London and Leeds unopened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The packaging is described as a "Black Box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, with the microphone neatly packaged inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Included accessories are an "ik thing" presumed to be drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, a small manual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, a bag for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, and two cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

A notable inclusion is a mic stand attachment, designed to fit onto a pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Build Quality and Design
The microphone has a "very nice weight" and feels "very, very solid," similar to a Shure SM58 vocal microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The gain control on the back is described as a "little turning controller" that sticks out slightly but is designed to be as flush as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It has an LED light on the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The user expressed interest in finding a "fluffy" wind cover for noise reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Cables and Connection
The microphone uses a micro USB port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. It comes with a micro USB to Lightning cable, which is important given the user's existing audio recording devices often use older connectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This cable can also be used to charge an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. A screw-in attachment ensures the cable is securely connected to the microphone, preventing it from being easily pulled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Setup and Initial Testing

The iRig Mic HD was connected to an iPad for initial testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While nothing immediately appeared on the iPad screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, the microphone was detected within the "Fire" audio recording app as "iRig mic HD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The app displayed sample rate options of 32,000 Hertz, 44,000 Hertz, and 48,000 Hertz, and channel options including stereo, mono left, mono right, and mono left and right, indicating it is a stereo mic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Upon connection, a blue LED on the microphone illuminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. During a test recording, the app's volume slider appeared to be at its maximum, suggesting a potentially high input level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## [[using_irig_mic_hd_for_interviews_and_recording | Intended Use and Applications]]

The user plans to utilize the iRig Mic HD for live streaming with Meerkat and AudioBoom, and possibly SoundCloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. It is considered "very good for podcasters" and individuals conducting interviews on the go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The microphone's design, particularly its weight, makes it suitable for [[using_irig_mic_hd_for_interviews_and_recording | handheld interviews]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

For static recording, the user intends to connect the iRig Mic HD to a boom mic stand and position it above the recording area, enhancing audio quality when used with an [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] or iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. While the [[comparison_of_audio_quality_between_apogee_mic_and_ipad_mic | iPad's built-in audio recording quality]] is "pretty good," the iRig Mic HD offers a more directional pickup pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The microphone will likely be used for interviews at Bushcraft 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. A separate video demo of its sound quality is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

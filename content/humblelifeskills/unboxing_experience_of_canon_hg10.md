Philip from The Gravity presents an unboxing video of the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | Canon HG10]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. He typically finds unboxing videos boring, but is doing this one because he has been given the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | Canon HG10]], the hard drive version of Canon's latest HD camera, on a 30-day trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This trial is described as "an additional Christmas present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, allowing him to use the camera over Christmas to shoot video and post it online for video blogging and citizen journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. He currently owns a [[comparison_between_canon_hg10_and_canon_hv20 | Canon HV20]], which is the tape drive version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The opportunity for the trial came about when Holly from Canon Camerabuzz.com contacted him after watching his videos and vlogs on dm.blip.tv and following his new media work, including videos from Poncam Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. She invited him to be one of the people trialing the Canon camera for 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. He praises Canon Camerabuzz.com as an example of companies realizing the value of giving products to the community for experts to use and provide direct recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Unboxing Process

The [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | Canon HG10]] arrived directly from Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The package included a DHL notice for the return shipping, which he emphasized the need to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The packaging was "nicely packed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Inside the box, he found the usual accompanying paperwork and CDs, including "Ulead DVD MovieFactory" and "Digital Video Solution," which he typically doesn't read or use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. He prefers to learn a device by simply using it rather than reading a manual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. He ensures all contents are kept together for the return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Initial Contents and First Impressions

The box notably includes an HDMI cable, which he commends as a positive improvement, noting it's gold-plated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Other accessories visible in the box include a battery and a strap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Upon unboxing the camera itself, his [[build_quality_and_features_of_canon_hg10 | first impressions]] are that it is "small" and looks "a little bit wider" than his [[comparison_between_canon_hg10_and_canon_hv20 | Canon HV20]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. He notes the balance of the camera is "very nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Observations on [[build_quality_and_features_of_canon_hg10 | Build Quality and Features]]

*   **Microphone Placement**: He questions why the built-in microphone is placed on the top of the camera, suggesting that audio should be captured from the front when shooting subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. However, he discovers an external mic input on the front, which he notes is a good addition and might not be present on the [[comparison_between_canon_hg10_and_canon_hv20 | HV20]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Design Elements**: The camera features a "beautiful looking carbon carbon looking bit on the back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Connectivity**: There's a flap for the HDMI output and component out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Viewfinder**: It includes a viewfinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Display Features**: Markings on the side indicate "Full HD 1080," "Instant AF Canon," and its 40GB hard drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Recording Capacity**: The 40GB hard drive allows for approximately 15 hours on long play and 11.5 hours on slow play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This extended recording capability would be ideal for travelers due to the HD quality video and reduced need for offloading data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The 2.5-inch drive form factor is nicely integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Controls**: The screen is described as "pretty nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The layout of controls, including backward/forward buttons, a function tab, and a mini SD card slot for photos, is similar to the [[comparison_between_canon_hg10_and_canon_hv20 | HV20]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. A USB connector is also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Battery Compartment**: He expresses dissatisfaction with the battery compartment, describing it as "precarious" and "almost like something out of Battlestar Galactica," feeling like an "afterthought" because there's no lip to securely hold the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. He would have preferred a slimmer, more lithium-based battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Front Light**: The camera features lights on the front, which were "brilliant" on the [[comparison_between_canon_hg10_and_canon_hv20 | HV20]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Top Controls**: There is a "nice little rocker on the top for fast forwarding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, and a hot shoe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Overall, the camera appears "nice and shiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, and he is eager to start using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Following the [[user_experience_with_canon_hg10 | User Experience]]

He plans to charge the battery and begin the 30-day trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. He will be posting videos on Vimeo's HD side and blip at canonhg10.blip.tv, as well as providing Twitter updates on twitter.com/canonhd10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

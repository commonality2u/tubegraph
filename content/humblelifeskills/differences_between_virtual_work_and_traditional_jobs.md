This information is part of a course on making money [[future_trends_in_online_work | online]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, which explores various platforms and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Income Fluctuation

Unlike a regular job with a consistent weekly or monthly salary, [[the_role_of_technology_in_modern_work_and_communication | virtual work]] can be highly dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Income can fluctuate dramatically, leading to good weeks and bad weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Factors influencing this variability include:
*   Changes in the platforms themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   Client availability (e.g., clients being on holiday) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   Other factors affecting demand for specific skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

## Examples of Virtual Work Platforms

The speaker personally uses and makes money from services such as:
*   Kamilly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   VidMob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Fiverr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Adsense, Google's advertising service, which can be earned from YouTube channels and owned websites/blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

## Strategic Growth in Virtual Work

For [[the_role_of_technology_in_modern_work_and_communication | virtual work]], building up income slowly has proven more effective for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This approach allows time to:
*   Identify what strategies and platforms work best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Understand what does not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Optimize the use of various platforms for maximum gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

The speaker also considers the [[future_trends_in_online_work | future of working online]] and how trends might evolve over the next 10 to 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

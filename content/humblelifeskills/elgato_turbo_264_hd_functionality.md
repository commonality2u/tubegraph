## What is the Elgato Turbo 264 HD?

The Elgato Turbo 264 HD is a hardware USB stick designed for faster video encoding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is manufactured by Elgato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In the UK, the device costs approximately 80 to 90 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, and around 80 to 90 bucks in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Its primary function is to encode and accelerate H.264 video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. H.264 is the common codec used for most video on the web, serving as the standard format and compression for web video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Setup and Components

Setting up the Elgato Turbo 264 HD is a straightforward process, typically taking only two to three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The installation involves using the included CD to install software and inputting serial codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The box contains a USB extender and the compact USB stick hardware device itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Accelerating Video Encoding

The device is particularly useful for users with older computer hardware, such as a five or six-year-old Mac Pro, where the internal CPUs might be too old to efficiently encode [[hd_video_quality | high-definition video]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The Elgato Turbo 264 HD can make the encoding process up to four times faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Internally, the device contains a small chip that takes over the video encoding job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This means the computer's main CPUs are not burdened, preventing the machine from slowing down during the encoding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This allows users to perform other tasks on their computer concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

When the Elgato unit is plugged into a USB port and begins an encoding task, a red light illuminates, indicating that it is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Software Integration and Export Options

The Elgato Turbo 264 HD integrates with video editing software, such as iMovie '11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. When exporting video, users can choose to [[using_quicktime_with_elgato_turbo_264_hd | export using QuickTime]] and select the Elgato Turbo 264 HD from the export drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Presets and Customization

The device comes with preset settings for common devices like iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. It also supports encoding to [[hd_video_quality | HD video quality]] at 720p and 1080p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Users can access an "Options" menu to modify various built-in settings or create their own custom settings to tweak audio and video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Direct Upload Capabilities

A notable feature is the ability to encode and directly upload videos to a YouTube account or an FTP account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This is particularly useful for users who need to quickly finish an edit and upload the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

When uploading to an FTP service, users can input protocol and account details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This is beneficial for services that then encode the video into different formats in the cloud and export to other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The device supports exporting to an FTP server that can then distribute the video to multiple sites simultaneously, such as Blip TV, Wistia, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Benefits and Use Cases

The Elgato Turbo 264 HD is highly beneficial for users with older laptops who frequently work with mobile video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This includes individuals using devices like Kodak PlayTouch or Canon XS200s, which record 720p video, and find that encoding [[hd_video_quality | high-definition video]] on the go takes a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. By offloading the encoding task to the dedicated chip, it [[optimizing_cpu_usage_while_recording_and_encoding | optimizes CPU usage while recording and encoding]], allowing for faster processing without slowing down the host computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

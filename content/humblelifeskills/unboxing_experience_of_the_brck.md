The BRCK device arrived on Monday, August 11th [00:00:00]. Its arrival followed a "debacle" with Royal Mail and USPS regarding tracking codes and delivery notifications [00:00:08]. An additional Â£30 customs fee was required, which was less of a "pain point" given that the initial Kickstarter contribution of $200 was made about a year prior [00:00:18]. The BRCK is seen as part of a "bigger project" [00:00:45].

## Initial Impressions and Packaging
The packaging was "nice and wrapped" [00:00:49] and described as being "very well" wrapped [00:01:20]. The device is from BRck.com and carries the motto, "if it works in Kenya it'll work anywhere" [00:01:03]. The unboxing process began quickly, as unboxings are typically "boring and static" [00:02:45].

The BRCK came in a "nice eco-friendly box" [00:02:50] with a sticker on the bottom [00:02:56]. Inside, there was a card that read, "Thank you for being an early supporter of the brick" [00:02:58], along with instructions on how to "set up your brick in seven simple steps" [00:03:08].

## Physical Description of the BRCK
Upon unboxing, the BRCK was noted to be "a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be" [00:03:18]. The device felt "pretty solid" and "tougher than a project box" [00:03:29]. It is referred to as "version one brick" [00:03:33] and its appearance is "very much like a brick" [00:03:44], appearing "very robust" and capable of "taking some serious Hammer" [00:03:47]. The word "brick" is etched on its top [00:03:55].

### Ports and Features
The bottom of the BRCK features an "expansion with a little plastic cover" [00:03:59], a power button [00:04:02], an auxiliary USB port [00:04:05], an Ethernet port [00:04:09], a SIM slot (medium size) [00:04:13], and a power USB port [00:04:17]. The Ethernet port suggests that the BRCK could be used to bypass hotel firewalls by connecting an Ethernet cable to it [00:04:27]. The auxiliary USB port allows for storage to be plugged in, making it "very interesting in terms of remote management" [00:04:41].

## Significance of the BRCK
The BRCK is described as "rugged internet for people and things" [00:01:26]. It is a "major major major thing" [00:01:35] for the unboxer. Its features include:
*   Easy setup [00:01:38]
*   Works in 140+ countries [00:01:38]
*   [[integration_of_brck_with_arduino_and_internet_of_things | Arduino compatible]] [00:01:40]
*   Weather and dust resistant [00:01:40]
*   Travel ready [00:01:43]
*   Secure connection [00:01:43]
*   8+ hour onboard power block [00:01:46]
*   Mobile router with onboard power and storage [00:01:49]
*   Rugged, Cloud managed, fully featured router with built-in failover and programmable GPIO expansion [00:01:52]

The BRCK can connect to the internet via RG45, GSM, Wi-Fi Bridge, and Ethernet over USB through a GPIO breakout [00:02:04]. Its rugged build and Cloud-managed interface make it "ideal for away teams, monitoring systems in remote locations, and businesses with challenging infrastructure" [00:02:11]. The BRCK's GPIO breakout offers 20 pins for digital and analog read/write, as well as I2C, SPI, and UART interfaces [00:02:22]. This, combined with its [[integration_of_brck_with_arduino_and_internet_of_things | Arduino profile]], makes it "ideal for quickly connecting hardware to The Internet of Things" [00:02:32]. The BRCK is "designed in Kenya, assembled in the US" [00:02:39].

The BRCK is considered a "very crucial component" to the [[rattler_project_and_brcks_role_in_it | Rattler project]] [00:04:52].

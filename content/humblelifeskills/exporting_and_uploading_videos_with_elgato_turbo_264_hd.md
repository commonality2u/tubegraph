The Elgato Turbo 264 HD is a hardware USB stick designed for faster video encoding [00:00:07]. Priced around £80 or £90 in the UK [00:00:14] (or $80-$90 in the US [00:03:39]), this device from Elgato accelerates H.264 video encoding [00:00:24]. H.264 is the common codec and compression format used for most video on the web [00:00:33].

## Setup and Core Functionality

Setting up the Elgato Turbo 264 HD is straightforward, typically taking only two to three minutes [00:00:45]. The process involves installing software from a CD, inputting serial codes, and connecting the USB stick to your computer, often via an included USB extender [00:00:47].

The device features a small internal chip that handles the video encoding process [00:04:02]. This means the encoding job is offloaded from your computer's main CPUs, preventing the computer from slowing down [00:04:10] and allowing for multitasking [00:04:14]. It can accelerate encoding, potentially making it four times faster [00:03:59]. This is particularly beneficial for users with older computers, such as a five or six-year-old Mac Pro, where the internal CPUs might struggle with the demands of high-definition video encoding [00:01:12].

## Video Exporting Options

The Elgato Turbo 264 HD integrates seamlessly with video editing software like iMovie '11 [00:01:31]. To utilize the device for exporting:

1.  Right-click on your video project [00:02:02].
2.  Select "Export using QuickTime" [00:02:04].
3.  In the export drop-down menu, an option for the Elgato Turbo 264 HD will appear [00:02:10].

Once selected, users have various preset options for export, including formats compatible with iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV [00:02:17]. It also supports encoding to high-definition resolutions like 720p and 1080p [00:02:22].

Customization is also possible; by clicking on "Options," users can access a range of built-in settings and even create their own custom settings to tweak audio and video parameters [00:02:41]. When the Elgato unit is actively encoding, a red light illuminates on the device [00:03:31].

## Direct Upload Capabilities

Beyond just accelerating encoding, the Elgato Turbo 264 HD also offers direct upload functionalities:

*   **YouTube Upload:** The device can encode video and then directly upload it to a YouTube account [00:02:26]. This feature is useful for quickly publishing edited videos [00:02:32].
*   **FTP Upload:** Users can also encode and upload videos to a standard FTP (File Transfer Protocol) account [00:02:28]. This is particularly advantageous for workflows involving cloud services [00:03:02].

> "This is really quite useful if you want to upload a video to an FTP Service that then encodes it to different other formats in the cloud... because a lot of those cloud services then export it to other services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>

Uploading to an FTP server can serve as an intermediary step, allowing the video to be further processed and then distributed to multiple platforms like Blip TV, Wistia, or YouTube simultaneously [00:03:17].

## Ideal Use Cases

The Elgato Turbo 264 HD is highly recommended for individuals with older laptops or those who frequently produce high-definition video while mobile [00:03:42]. For example, users of devices like the Kodak PlayTouch or Canon XS200s (which record in 720p [00:03:50]) who find that encoding HD video on the go takes too long, can significantly benefit from the faster encoding speeds offered by this device [00:03:54].

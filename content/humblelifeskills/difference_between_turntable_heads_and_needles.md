When using a [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]], it's possible to encounter situations where different "heads" or "play heads" are required for optimal playback and conversion of various record types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:11">[01:45:11]</a>.

## Different Types of Heads

The [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] does not always come with multiple heads initially, but different heads are available for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:11">[01:45:11]</a>. For example, a dedicated "78 RPM head" is recommended for [[converting_78_rpm_records_with_usb_turntable | converting 78 RPM records]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:32">[05:05:32]</a>. These records are notably thick and have more defined grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:46">[05:11:46]</a>. It is speculated that the needle on a 78 RPM head might be thicker to accommodate these characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>. The exact visual differences between the two needles, however, were not directly observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:07">[05:21:07]</a>.

Replacement "play heads" can cost approximately Â£15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:42">[04:48:42]</a>.

## Troubleshooting with Heads and Needles

Proper installation of turntable components is crucial for playback. An instance of a [[troubleshooting_common_issues_with_the_usb_turntable | skipping]] record was resolved by realizing that the counterweight had not been attached, which meant there was insufficient force to keep the needle on the record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:25">[03:34:25]</a>. Without the counterweight, the needle would simply jump and skip across the record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

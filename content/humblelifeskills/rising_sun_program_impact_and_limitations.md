The speaker's involvement with the [[youth_leadership_program | youth leadership program]] known as Rising Sun began in 2012, driven by a personal commitment to embrace new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Having participated for seven summers, first as a participant and then as a staff member, the speaker offers their personal interpretation of the program's successes, methods, and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## What is Rising Sun?

The Lewis August Jones Foundation, which operates Rising Sun, defines its mission as "creating a better world for tomorrow by inspiring young leaders today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Describing itself as an intentional community, similar to co-housing, it brings together a group of people who choose to live together, sharing resources, responsibilities, and actively pursuing a common vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

The program annually selects bright, motivated young people aged 14 to 16 from various countries worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. These participants live in New York for two months over the summer, separated by gender, to build and test a community through a carefully designed program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

The community development process at Rising Sun often aligns with Tuckman's group development model:
*   **Forming**: Initial stage where everyone is playing nicely and getting to know each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Storming**: Challenges arise as individuals get to know each other more deeply and lack established ways of dealing with conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Norming**: Shared values and interaction methods are agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Performing**: The group becomes highly functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Impact of Rising Sun

Rising Sun has had a "massive impact" on the speaker's life, even humorously described as "ruining" previous aspirations like becoming an astronaut or accumulating wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The program fostered a shift towards working for an international medical relief charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Community Resilience and Trust
A notable example of a "performing" community involved a four-hour conversation among 50 teenage girls about a perceived theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Contrary to staff expectations of punishment, the girls focused on the incident's threat to their mutual trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. They resolved to "completely forgive whoever had carried out the incident" and consciously attempt to trust each other more, demonstrating a "mature and interesting response" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This incident showcased the community's ability to use its framework for interaction to move forward, rather than collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Alumni Contributions
Rising Sun alumni consistently contribute positively to their local and global communities:
*   One young person fundraised to put [[solar_panel_usage | solar panels]] on her school roof within months of finishing the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   Another alumnus released a worldwide film, "Chasing Ice," focusing on environmental issues and receding glaciers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Marius, an organizer of a TEDx event, also exemplifies the program's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## How Rising Sun Achieves its Impact

While the program includes typical summer camp activities like sports, drama, art, and hiking, the "what" is merely a "vehicle" for the "how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Communication
A core element is the focus on communication, encompassing speaking, listening, and being heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Upon arrival, mobile phones are collected and locked away for the entire two months, forcing participants to focus inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. A key activity is "wisdom circles," where small groups of four or five young people discuss posed questions weekly, practicing speaking from the heart and challenging ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For some, this is their first experience of such deep conversation, highlighting a common modern disconnect despite digital connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This enhanced communication strengthens community bonds and provides a structure for negotiation, conflict resolution, and addressing community issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Valuing the Individual and Redefining Fairness
Through intense communal living and communication, participants learn to value each member as an individual, assessing their actions and achievements within their unique context rather than against universal standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This challenges conventional notions of fairness, moving beyond equal division to understanding that "fair might actually mean a different contribution from different people or that people need different sized pieces of that cake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. For young people already privileged with life opportunities, this lesson, that "to whom much is given perhaps much is expected," is considered very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Servant Leadership
The program fosters "servant leadership," emphasizing leading from within the community and meeting its needs before one's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This means realizing that leadership doesn't necessarily involve standing at the front or giving orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. While leadership concepts are openly discussed, the living experience itself is seen as the primary teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. For example, a different community member takes charge each day, and if they fail to wake up, the entire community might miss breakfast, as staff won't intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Collective Action
Bringing together young people with personal experience of global issues and conflict can initially feel overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. However, by surrounding themselves with an inspiring group and working together, participants are empowered to engage and affect change in their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. The program builds a supportive network; alumni remain connected, inspiring each other and sometimes collaborating on projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This shared understanding is perpetuated by bringing back alumni as staff, creating a deep commonality that transcends direct shared experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Limitations of Rising Sun

Despite its strengths, the speaker acknowledges certain limitations:
*   **Sustainability and Realism**: The single-gender, seven-week group might not fully test the community or be long-term sustainable, though it provides a "taste of what a community could be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Risk of Groupthink**: Due to the selection process (choosing young people receptive to Rising Sun ideas) and the strong "norming" phase, there's a risk that participants might not only act similarly but also begin to think identically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Conclusion and Challenge

The speaker expresses deep gratitude for the lessons learned from Rising Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Drawing on the program's "council" meetings, where staff impart wisdom, the speaker challenges the audience to apply Rising Sun's ideas to better "our shared coexistence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The challenge includes:
*   Communicating and listening to your community, ensuring all voices are heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
*   Exploring the concept of valuing every individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   Surrounding yourself with inspiring people to collectively bring about change in local or global communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

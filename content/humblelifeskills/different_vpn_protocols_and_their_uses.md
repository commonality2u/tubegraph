A [[vpn_and_data_privacy | VPN]] (Virtual Private Network) provides an additional layer of encrypted security by creating a secure tunnel for data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This can help mitigate against denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which aim to knock users offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Using a VPN can reduce the attack surface of a computer by sending data through an encrypted tunnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Different VPN protocols offer varying compression or speed benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## Speedify: Connection Bonding for Speed and Reliability
Speedify is a [[vpn_connection_bonding | VPN client]] with the ability to bond multiple connections together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This allows users to combine internet connections, such as 4G unlimited tethering plans, super-fast Ethernet, or multiple Wi-Fi networks, to achieve faster speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Speedify can bond up to 10 devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

Key features of Speedify:
*   **Speed and Reliability Boost:** Uses connected connections together for both reliability and a speed boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Redundant Mode:** Optionally sends all traffic across each connection redundantly to improve reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **VPN Integration:** Now integrates a VPN service within its client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Global Server Locations:** Supports connecting to the closest country server for travelers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, with servers in popular countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   **P2P Server Support:** Includes a dedicated P2P (Peer-to-Peer) server option, which is relatively rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Performance:** In one test, Speedify showed a stable ping of 38-39 milliseconds, with downloads around 22-24 Mbps and uploads around 40-60 Mbps on a 4G connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This performance is considered perfect for [[vpn_for_gaming_and_streaming | live streaming]] and [[vpn_for_gaming_and_streaming | gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. Speedify is generally more consistent and less likely to disconnect than certain gaming-optimized VPNs for daily use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   **Redundancy:** Allows for adding redundancy to an internet connection by bonding multiple providers (e.g., Vodafone, 3, O2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. If one network fails, others serve as backups, making it a perfect tool for mission-critical video streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

## OpenVPN Protocol for Gaming
IBVPN is another VPN provider that supports four different VPN protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. One of these is OpenVPN, which can be optimized for specific uses.

Key characteristics of OpenVPN (as demonstrated with IBVPN's gaming server):
*   **Optimized for Gaming:** IBVPN offers dedicated "Gaming Netherlands" servers using the OpenVPN protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. These servers are hosted on an "incredibly fast backbone" within data centers with huge capacity (e.g., 700 gigabits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   [[impact_of_vpn_on_latency_and_speed | **Speed vs. Latency Trade-off**]]: While connecting to an OpenVPN gaming server in the Netherlands from the UK, download speeds significantly increased (e.g., from 20 Mbps with Speedify to 45 Mbps with OpenVPN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. However, the ping (latency) also increased (e.g., from 35 ms to 55 ms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Game Servers:** The effectiveness of these gaming VPNs lies in hosting the game servers on the same network as the VPN server, reducing additional hops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. This provides a low-latency connection crucial for professional gamers to prevent being knocked offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
*   **Use Case Specificity:** While excellent for [[vpn_for_gaming_and_streaming | gaming]], especially on Dutch servers or specific games like Battlefield, this type of optimized connection may not work well for other activities like [[vpn_for_gaming_and_streaming | live streaming]] over extended periods, as it is specifically optimized for gaming traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

## Choosing the Right VPN and Protocol
The choice of VPN and its protocol is an "art form," as different VPNs are suited for different purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   For general daily browsing, websites, and YouTube, a more consistent VPN like Speedify might be preferred, even with a slightly higher ping, as it is more stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.
*   For [[vpn_for_gaming_and_streaming | dedicated gaming]], especially on servers optimized for that purpose, a VPN using a protocol like OpenVPN on a gaming-specific server can offer higher speeds, even if it introduces slightly more latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. A lower ping is generally better for gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.
*   For [[vpn_for_gaming_and_streaming | live streaming]] and avoiding DDoS attacks, using a VPN can protect the host's IP address. Streamers should also avoid chatting directly in the chat box, as some tools can discover the streamer's IP address from chat connections and flood it, knocking them offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. Moderators or a proxy should be used for chat instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.

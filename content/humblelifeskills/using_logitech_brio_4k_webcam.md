The Logitech Brio 4K is described as a "great little webcam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While it performs well, it is noted that it is "not as good as a dslr but it does the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

The speaker has experience "tinkering with settings" on various Logitech webcams, including the [[Logitech C920 and C930e camera settings | Logitech C920]], [[Logitech C920 and C930e camera settings | C930e]], and the Brio 4K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

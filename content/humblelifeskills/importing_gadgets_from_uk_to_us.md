This article details the process and considerations for importing unique gadgets from the UK to the US, using the USB Missile Launcher as a case study.

## Case Study: The USB Missile Launcher

A USB Missile Launcher was received as a package from the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This device is described as a "USB missile launcher PC Computer" that "includes launch sound effect" and can "aim and target and fly little missiles at people" via software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Origin and Availability

The USB Missile Launcher is believed to be unavailable in the US, possibly being an own-brand item from Marks & Spencer in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. While manufactured in China, it is copyrighted by Marks & Spencer PLC, suggesting they are the sole distributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Unless there is an unknown US importer, the product is not directly available in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Despite its limited US availability, the gadget may have been advertised on international tech sites like Gizmodo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Potential Import Services

For individuals interested in acquiring such a unique gadget from the UK, there's an offer to provide an import service. This involves picking up the item in the UK and importing it into the US for a charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The drivers for the device are "Windows only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, which impacts its [[compatibility_with_apps_and_devices | compatibility with other operating systems]].

The business, "Your Custom Cable.com," began approximately two years ago by selling cables online, initially through the internet and later launching its own website due to successful demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17">[01:17]</a>. The venture started small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>, leveraging the founders' background in [[custom_cables_for_audio_recording | audio tech]] work for rock concerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51">[01:51]</a>. Despite an ongoing recession, the business has not been negatively impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18">[02:18]</a>.

## Products and Services
The company specializes in [[custom_audio_cables_production | custom cables]] designed for various audio applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03">[09:03]</a>. Most of their cables are created for guitarists using special systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>.

A key strength of the company is its ability to create cables to exact, specific lengths, such as 27 centimeters, a service not typically offered by other companies that only sell standard lengths like 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36">[06:36]</a>. This [[custom_audio_cables_production | custom]] approach doesn't increase costs because any cut-off pieces from a roll are used elsewhere, ensuring efficient material use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34">[07:34]</a>.

### Production Time
*   **Simple connections**: These typically take about 5 to 10 minutes to assemble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15">[03:15]</a>.
*   **Large systems**: Complex installations, like the thick cables connecting stages to mixing consoles for big concerts, can take about three weeks to build and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05">[04:05]</a>. Cables for very specific or unique needs might require additional time for assembly and design planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>.

### Pricing
Discounts are available for customers purchasing larger quantities of cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36">[03:36]</a>.

## Business Growth and Staffing
The owner anticipates significant growth within the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48">[04:48]</a>. Currently, the owner's wife is expected to join the business to handle administration and web design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55">[04:55]</a>. The company is actively seeking qualified personnel to support its expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02">[05:02]</a>.

The owner's background as a musician, specifically a drummer, prior to becoming involved in audio engineering, informs the business's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16">[08:16]</a>.

## Addressing Specific Customer Needs
The company has experience with specific technical challenges, such as connecting microphones (like a Rode mic) to iPhones using [[iphone_to_xlr_cable_solutions | iPhone to XLR cable solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46">[10:46]</a>. A common issue encountered is the iPhone's behavior when a headset with volume controls is unplugged, causing music to start playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54">[11:54]</a>. The suggested solution is to first disconnect the microphone from the Rode, then unplug the four-pin connector from the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16">[12:16]</a>.

The company is also working on a solution for a common problem where the iPhone's plug is too small to allow both external audio input and headphone monitoring simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07">[13:07]</a>. They plan to create a very small cable with a jack for headphones, though they are still testing if the audio signal from the audio boot will pass through this connection for real-time monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21">[13:21]</a>.

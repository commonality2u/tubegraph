A [[setting_up_a_kodak_pulse_photo_frame | Kodak Pulse photo frame]] in the studio was observed not to be cycling through photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Problem Identification

Upon interaction with the device, a message appeared stating that "the wireless network can't be found" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This indicated that the device was not connected to a network.

## Resolution

The immediate next step identified was the need to [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | set up the wireless network]] for the photo frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Once connected, the frame is intended to cycle through photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The frame also has the capability to receive pictures via an [[configuring_email_for_kodak_photo_frame | email address]], allowing users to send images (e.g., from Instagram) directly to the frame for display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

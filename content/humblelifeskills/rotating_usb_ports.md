The "Roto block" is a [[usb_hub_functionality | USB hub]] combo designed as a square block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is particularly useful for users of Mac Airs, which often have limited USB ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, addressing [[macbook_air_usb_limitations | MacBook Air USB limitations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Features

### Rotational Design
A key feature of the Roto block is its ability to be positioned at different angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, allowing connections sideways or in various other orientations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The USB ports themselves also rotate outwards, enabling users to set them at different angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This design helps in connecting devices at virtually any desired angle, avoiding common frustrations with standard USB ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Integrated Card Reader
The device includes a card reader that supports multiple formats, including XD, SD, MMC, T-Flash, and MS cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. These card reader slots are accessible on all sides of the block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Availability and Build Quality
The Roto block can be acquired from sources like China for approximately Â£10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While its build quality is not described as "brilliant," it is expected to perform its function for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

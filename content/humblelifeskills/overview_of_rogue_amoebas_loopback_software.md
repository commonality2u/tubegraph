*   Different applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

## Considerations

While effective, Loopback is noted as "kind of expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The cost might lead some users to consider purchasing hardware for audio capture instead, if they are spending a similar amount of money on software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

An individual describes their experience with [[Online shopping addiction | online shopping addiction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, specifically manifesting as a [[tshirt_addiction | t-shirt addiction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Characteristics

Initially, buying "normal t-shirts" was manageable, and there was no felt need to "buy 10 at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, the habit evolved to become "so addictive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, with purchases completed in just "three clicks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The individual would click and order without fully realizing the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Consequences

The addiction led to significant negative outcomes:
*   **Financial Strain**
    *   Additional costs were incurred, such as a customs duty of "an extra 20" to receive purchased items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   The severity of the addiction meant that money for purchases was prioritized, even if it led to periods where "some weeks we wouldn't eat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This highlights a severe impact on [[consumerism_and_its_effects | consumerism and its effects]] and a failure in [[managing_spending_habits | managing spending habits]].
*   **Loss of Control**
    *   The collection grew to "50 shirts," at which point the situation was "getting out of hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   The sheer volume of purchases necessitated buying "a new cupboard" to store them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

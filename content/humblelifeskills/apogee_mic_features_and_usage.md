The Apogee mic is described as a "great little solid device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> known for its clear and nice audio quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It is considered a better microphone than the one built into the iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Connectivity

The Apogee mic features a "funky different connector on the bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. To connect it to various devices, specific cables are required:
*   For the [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone 4S]] (which has an older connector), a dedicated cable is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   For iPads and other devices with a Lightning connector, a custom-made cable was imported from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This cable, costing around Â£40, features a Lightning connector on one end and the Apogee mic connector on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. It took approximately a month and a half to arrive due to being custom-made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It is suggested that newer Apogee mics might now ship with Lightning connectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Usage Scenarios

The Apogee mic is primarily used for recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> and is particularly suitable for:
*   **Video Blogging:** It provides better audio quality for video blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> and is a "nice little solution" for recording personal video blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **General Recording:** The microphone's audio is described as very clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Integration with Devices
The mic can be used with both iPads and iPhones (specifically, the [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone 4S]] was mentioned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It works with the native camera app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> and the YouTube Capture app, which is favored for its stabilization, clip editing, and streamlined workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Practical Application
While not ideal for interviews, it could potentially be used on a boom pole with a "fluff thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. However, its short cable might necessitate keeping it close to the audio source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Audio Control

When using the Apogee mic, it's necessary to adjust its gain. The speaker noted that initially jacking up the mic's gain all the way and then backing it off helped achieve optimal sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. If the audio is too loud, it may be over-modulating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Users are encouraged to provide feedback on audio levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

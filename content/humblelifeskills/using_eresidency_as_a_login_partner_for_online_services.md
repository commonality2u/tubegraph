## Current Applications

Some online services, such as Teleport, are utilizing [[what_is_eresidency | e-residency]] as a login mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:49">[01:56:49]</a>. This implementation is noted as "super interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:21">[01:58:21]</a>.

## Future Implications

The speaker draws a comparison to past experiences with Facebook Connect, where users sometimes had to reactivate their Facebook accounts to log into certain sites after deactivating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:08">[02:02:08]</a>. There is interest in observing how [[what_is_eresidency | e-residency]] will function as a login partner over the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:37">[02:15:37]</a>, viewing current engagement as "getting in early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:09">[02:18:09]</a>.

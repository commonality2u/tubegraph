Lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries, such as the [[tekkeon_3450i_lithium_polymer_battery_features | Tekkeon 3450i]], are noted for being superior to most other rechargeable batteries due to several key features and performance characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Features of the Tekkeon 3450i (example LiPo battery)

The Tekkeon 3450i is a 58-watt lithium polymer battery that includes several user-friendly features:
*   **USB Connectivity** It has a connector that can be used for USB devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **On/Off Switch** A dedicated switch for power control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Adjustable Voltage** Dip switch settings allow users to set different output voltages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Battery Level Indicator** Pressing a button provides an indicator of the current charge level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Construction** The battery cell itself is wrapped in a polymer material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It also includes a small fan at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Variant Availability** A model called the 3750 is available, which features only USB connectivity and auto-detection capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Performance in Extreme Conditions

A significant advantage of lithium polymer batteries is their [[battery_performance_in_various_conditions | performance in varying temperatures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. They hold their charge better than most other products in both cold weather and heat, largely due to their polymer wrapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

For instance, a Tekkeon 3450i successfully powered a [[battery_and_power_options_for_cradlepoint | Cradlepoint PHS 300]] for approximately a day and a half in a rucksack at South by Southwest in Austin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Despite the "absolutely boiling hot" conditions, the battery worked perfectly, with consistent power output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Battery Life Extension

The Tekkeon 3450i can have its battery life doubled through [[battery_life_extension_using_additional_components | an adapter bracket]] that allows a second battery to be attached underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. With conservative use, this extended setup could potentially power a device for up to a week in a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. These batteries are noted to work perfectly with [[battery_and_power_options_for_cradlepoint | Cradlepoint]] devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

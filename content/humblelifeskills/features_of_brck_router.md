The BRCK, from brck.com, arrived after initial shipping and customs hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>. The device's tagline is "If it works in Kenya, it'll work anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">00:01:08</a>, emphasizing its ruggedness and versatility. It is considered a "flagstone piece" of the [[rattler_project_and_brcks_role_in_it | Rattler project]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">00:01:16</a>. The [[unboxing_experience_of_the_brck | unboxing]] revealed it to be smaller than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">00:03:18</a>.

[[introduction_to_max_self_defense | Max Self Defense]] offers team-building programs that combine a serious subject with an enjoyable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The training is led by Mark Wingfield and Mark Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Approach to Training
[[introduction_to_max_self_defense | Max Self Defense]] provides simple, effective [[practical_self_defense_techniques | self-defense training]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. They extract the easiest and most practical elements from [[application_of_martial_arts_in_self_defense | martial arts]] to create highly practical self-defense techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While based in the East Midlands, they travel across the UK and have opportunities in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Benefits for Team Building
The training serves a dual purpose: ensuring staff, loved ones, or individuals can stay safe, and effectively building teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Participants bond with colleagues by engaging in activities like "whacking those bags," which helps alleviate stress and provides a great time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Team Building with a Purpose
[[introduction_to_max_self_defense | Max Self Defense]] describes its offering as "team building with a purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Unlike typical team events such as paintballing or quad biking, which are fun but may not foster strong team bonds, their programs ensure that participants truly bond as a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The training aims to bring out the best in people, instill confidence, and prepare individuals for potential conflict, akin to first aid â€“ available if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

> [!tip] Practical Example: The Fence
> A self-defense technique called "the fence" involves maintaining distance from an aggressor ("stay back") while being prepared to cover and counter an attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Another part of "the fence" is "the pleading," where one appears to be submissive to make the aggressor think they are in charge, while still being ready to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

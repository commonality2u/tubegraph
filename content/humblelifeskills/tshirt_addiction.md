## Characteristics of the Addiction

The addiction is characterized by:
*   **Favorite Retailer** The individual primarily purchases T-shirts from Threadless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. They identify themselves as an "addict from buying Threadless of the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Impulse Buying** The buying process is described as impulsive, involving merely clicking a page and ordering without fully realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Progression** Initially, the individual bought normal T-shirts and "had a handle on it," not feeling the need to buy 10 at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Over time, the habit escalated, becoming "too much" and "so addictive," with purchases completed in "three clicks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

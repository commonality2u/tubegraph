Approximately half a million Iraqis have sought refuge in Jordan, having fled the violence and instability of their homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. While some are wealthy enough for official residence permits, the majority face significant [[challenges_faced_by_iraqi_refugees_in_jordan | challenges]] and live in a "twilight zone" without official status or legal rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Their [[impact_of_lack_of_legal_status_on_iraqi_refugees | presence in Jordan is technically illegal]], and many do not possess valid visas or even passports, leaving them stranded with their lives on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Pervasive Despair and Loss of Hope

For many Iraqi refugees, the initial hope for a better future has given way to despair as years pass in exile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. The situation is described as "desperate," with the veneer of normality being very thin despite living in urban settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

A 37-year-old veterinary surgeon from Baghdad, who lost five family members in Iraq, lives in bleak isolation, surviving "hand to mouth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. He works illegally for cut-price pay, often only for a month or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. He expresses profound loss and lack of future:
> "in my my age it's difficult to me to to have a good life after this i i lost my job i lost my future i lost my family lost my work but what i have nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>

The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) representative in Amman, Imran Riza, stated that refugees are running out of resources, and their situation is becoming "much more desperate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the biggest void among refugees is hope:
> "what they really don't have at the moment when you talk to them is hope. They really do not see where their future is is is lying right now there's a very high level of despair amongst them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>

For a refugee married with a three-year-old daughter, who constantly struggles with rising rents and cold winters, their existence is about waiting for an opportunity to "climb out of the hole they are trapped in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. They describe their predicament as "a matter of your life," not a temporary period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## Fears and Insecurity

Fear is a constant companion for Iraqi refugees in Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. While they may have escaped physical dangers in Iraq, they remain afraid of the police, each other, the past, and the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

*   **Deportation**: Without valid visas, refugees can be deported at any time, for any reason, back to Iraq, with their fates unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This fear leads many to choose to "fade away from sight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. One refugee explained their chosen way of life: "to be invisible visible and unseen... it's relatively young it means a little bit safe than to be visible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Running out of resources**: Many came to Jordan expecting to stay for a limited time with some savings, but those resources have run out, leading to increasingly dire situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   **Continued instability in Iraq**: Despite increasing talk of Iraqi refugees returning at the start of 2008, those in Jordan are unwilling to leave until their security in Iraq is absolutely assured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.

## Lingering Hopes and Ambitions

Despite the pervasive despair, some refugees retain hopes and ambitions, particularly concerning their future and that of their children.

*   **Return to Iraq**: Um Muhammad, a lab technician and mother of three, dreams of returning to her life in Iraq, but she and her family will wait until there is a guarantee of security for their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Education and Work**: Um Muhammad herself is an ambitious woman who wants to finish her studies as a lab technician, a pursuit interrupted by the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. She expresses a strong desire to work and help her family, stating, "i like my job and i don't like to i don't like to stay home... i want to find a job and and i i find myself when i work not at home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   **Simple Joys**: Even amidst hardship, there are moments of simple happiness. A refugee with a three-year-old daughter finds happiness with his little girl, sometimes with the sun rising and bringing warmth, or when he can momentarily forget his troubles with local neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

## Challenges for the International Community

The international community was slow to react to Iraq's refugee crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. Although [[efforts_by_jordan_and_international_communities_to_aid_iraqi_refugees | efforts by Jordan and international aid organizations]] like UNHCR have grown, providing basic humanitarian assistance, education, and cash handouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>, these have only made conditions "barely tolerable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

A significant challenge is the long-term nature of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. It is not a short-term issue that can be dealt with in a few months, but a "medium-term situation" that requires sustained focus on the humanitarian element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. There is a real danger that the international community will not follow through on earlier relief efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

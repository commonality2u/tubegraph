Maintaining a crowdfunding campaign presents several significant challenges, particularly for those new to the process. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Understanding Campaign Dynamics

One of the primary difficulties lies in grasping how to effectively manage and drive a campaign once it's launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It requires more than just initial setup; there's a need for continuous "tweaks" and the establishment of "momentum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Effective communication with supporters is also vital throughout the campaign's duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Pressure of Time-Limited Platforms

Many popular crowdfunding platforms, such as Kickstarter, are time-limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This characteristic, part of the [[differences_between_timelimited_and_flexible_crowdfunding_platforms | differences between time-limited and flexible crowdfunding platforms]], imposes considerable pressure on campaigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While this can be beneficial for projects with a clear product or item to sell by a specific date, it can be debilitating for more conceptual ideas or projects that are supplementary to one's main work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Burden of Perks and Deadlines

A significant challenge arises from the obligation to offer [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | perks]] and adhere strictly to a set timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This can be "debilitating" for creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, as the effort involved in devising and delivering [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | perks]], combined with the pressure of deadlines, can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Alternative Approaches

For those seeking to mitigate these challenges, particularly the pressure of [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | perks]] and strict deadlines, platforms like GoFundMe offer an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The [[advantages_of_using_gofundme_over_kickstarter | advantages of using GoFundMe over Kickstarter]] for such projects include greater flexibility without the same immediate demands for [[incentives_and_perks_in_crowdfunding_campaigns | perk]] fulfillment or specific end dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This approach can be useful for [[using_crowdfunding_for_sustainable_cash_flow_and_advocacy_projects | using crowdfunding for sustainable cash flow and advocacy projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

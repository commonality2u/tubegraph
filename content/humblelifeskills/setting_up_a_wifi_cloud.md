The user describes their current internet connectivity setup and their desire to broaden its range by [[extending_wifi_range | setting up a Wi-Fi cloud]].

## Current Connectivity Challenges
Currently, the user relies on a [[wifi_router_setup | Wi-Fi router]] at home, which provides [[using_wifi_and_mobile_data_for_connectivity | Wi-Fi connection]] for their phone primarily downstairs [00:00:12]. A significant limitation is the need to return home to send clips or access the internet, as they wish to avoid the high costs of Orange's mobile data packages [00:00:34].

## The Wi-Fi Cloud Concept
To overcome these limitations, the user is exploring the possibility of [[extending_wifi_range | setting up a Wi-Fi cloud]] [00:00:56]. This would involve placing a device on the side of their building, with all necessary wiring routed from the loft [00:01:01].

### Technical Requirements
To establish this expanded wireless network, several components and capabilities are considered:
*   **[[using_a_radius_server | Radius Server]]**: A [[using_a_radius_server | Radius server]] is identified as a necessary component [00:01:08]. The user already possesses 19-inch rack servers that could potentially host this service [00:01:11].
*   **Wi-Fi Aerial**: The user plans to acquire a suitable Wi-Fi aerial, such as a flat panel or a general aerial [00:01:26].
*   **Transmission Range**: It has been suggested that with a good line of sight or a sufficiently high pole, it's possible to transmit Wi-Fi signals up to five to ten miles [00:01:33].
*   **[[authentication_using_radius_for_wifi_service | Authentication]]**: To manage access, [[authentication_using_radius_for_wifi_service | authentication using Radius]] is proposed, allowing for specific user logins [00:01:43].

### Potential Service Offering
The expanded Wi-Fi network could potentially be advertised as a service, allowing people with phones or PDAs to access the internet without incurring high data charges [00:01:49].

## Request for Assistance
The user is actively seeking assistance from individuals with Wi-Fi knowledge to help with [[extending_wifi_range | setting up a Wi-Fi cloud]] [00:01:15]. They encourage anyone with ideas or expertise to make contact [00:02:03].

Data consumption can be significant, with one user burning through 10 GB in eight days, costing £30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This usage includes browsing and watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Cost Analysis

Paying £30 for data every week is considered expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. To reduce costs, switching to a [[monthly_paid_tariffs | monthly paid tariff]] is being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For example, EE offers a 50 GB 4G plan for £50 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

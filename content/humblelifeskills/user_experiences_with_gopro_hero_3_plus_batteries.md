The speaker shares their experience with the [[GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] and its battery reliability, while also seeking input from owners of the GoPro Hero 3 Plus Edition regarding battery performance.

## GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition Battery Issues
The speaker has not used their [[GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] much since purchasing it due to reliability concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The primary issue is the "incredibly unreliable" battery that came with the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Key problems include:
*   **Inconsistent Battery Life** The battery life varies significantly, ranging from half an hour to an hour and a half, and rarely reaching two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **[[Overheating problems with GoPro cameras | Overheating problems with GoPro cameras | Overheating]]** The battery gets "extremely hot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, and the overheating can cause the camera to lock up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This concern is particularly relevant for [[GoPro usage in various environments and conditions | usage in hotter climates or conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, contrasting with GoPro's common use in cold environments like surfing or snowboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The speaker has the latest firmware installed on their camera, suggesting it might be a battery fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Testing Alternative Batteries
A Wasabi Power [[GoPro Hero 3 battery reliability issues | GoPro 3 battery]] was found, prompting the speaker to re-evaluate the camera's battery issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The speaker had previously purchased another Wasabi Power battery, suspecting the original might be faulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The Wasabi Power battery specifications are 3.7 volts, 1200 milliamps, and 4.4 watt-hours, designed to replace the original Hero 3 battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The speaker plans to charge this new battery and run the GoPro until it's flat to determine if the issues are due to a faulty battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Potential Solutions and Community Questions
The speaker notes that a pack is available for about $60 that allows the GoPro to run directly from main power, which would eliminate [[Overheating problems with GoPro cameras | battery overheating]] and charging issues, as the battery would not be inside the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This would improve uptime and prevent the camera from locking up due to heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The speaker is particularly interested in whether [[GoPro Hero 3 Plus Edition owners]] have found the GoPro Hero 3 Plus to be more reliable with its batteries, questioning if the problem has been fixed in that edition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. They ask other users if they have experienced similar battery issues with their [[GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] and how they resolved them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

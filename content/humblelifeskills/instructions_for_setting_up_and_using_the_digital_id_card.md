The [[process_of_obtaining_an_estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card | process of obtaining an Estonian e-Residency digital ID card]] is described as super easy and straightforward, taking a short time at the embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>. The actual collection involves a fingerprint scan and passport verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.

## Components of the e-Residency Pack

Upon collecting the [[features_and_uses_of_the_estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card | digital ID]], the user receives an interesting pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a> which includes:
*   The e-Residency card itself, which includes RFID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>.
*   Instructions on how to use the card with the reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>.
*   A rippable code, presumably a PIN, needed to authorize the card upon sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:18">[02:02:18]</a>.
*   A sheet detailing the conditions for use of certificates issued for various ID cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:29">[02:10:29]</a>.
*   A compact card reader, manufactured by Web Brick Worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:49">[02:56:49]</a>.

### The Card Reader

The card reader is a small black device that flips out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:13">[02:29:13]</a>. It features a USB connection that plugs into a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:46">[02:44:46]</a>. The card is inserted into the reader, making contact with internal points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:33">[03:06:33]</a>. The card touches a specific space on the back of the reader for proper connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Usage Instructions

The pack contains basic instructions for setting up the card:
1.  **Insert the card:** "Take your ID card, open the reader by sliding it into the plus shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>.
2.  **Ensure contact:** "When using the card, make sure there is contact between the chip and the reader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>.
3.  **Access the portal:** Go to "e-estonia.ee/welcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>.

### Digital Capabilities

The e-Residency card provides [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | digital signing capabilities]] through 2048-bit encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>. This allows for unique, unfakeable digital signatures on documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>. It also opens up access to various [[features_and_uses_of_the_estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card | digital services offered by Estonia]], including setting up a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

Using the [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digital ID card]] to log into digital services is a subsequent step after initial setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:12">[04:46:12]</a>.

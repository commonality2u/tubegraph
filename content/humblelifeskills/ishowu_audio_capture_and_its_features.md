For users on newer Mac operating systems like Big Sur or those with an [[m1_mac | M1 Mac]] looking to capture virtual audio in software on a budget, [[alternatives_to_soundflower_for_audio_capture | traditional methods]] like Soundflower are no longer reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Soundflower, an open-source kernel extension, became buggy and its project ended around 2015 due to continuous changes in how macOS handles and captures audio across different operating system versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While Rogue Amoeba offers "Loopback," it is generally considered expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Evolution of IShowU Audio Capture

An earlier audio capture utility called "IShowU Audio Capture" emerged when Soundflower started failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. However, finding and installing its driver was difficult, particularly as new macOS versions like Catalina continuously altered the core audio subsystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## IShowU Instant: The Modern Solution

The same company that developed the original IShowU Audio Capture now offers IShowU Instant, a screen recorder that is fully compatible with Big Sur and [[m1_mac | M1 Macs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This compatibility was a key requirement for users with [[m1_mac | M1 MacBook Airs]] seeking native Apple [[m1_mac | M1]] support for better system resource management and higher FPS capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Key Features and Benefits

IShowU Instant is available for approximately $24 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. For this price, users receive both a screen capture utility for Mac and the essential audio driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### SWB Audio Capture Driver

The bundled audio driver, known as "SWB Audio Capture" (Shiny White Box Audio Capture), automatically installs with IShowU Instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This driver enables the capture and routing of virtual audio—including game audio, music, and background system audio—into applications like Zoom, Microsoft Meet, or OBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Advanced Features

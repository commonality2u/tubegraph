Homeless individuals encounter significant obstacles when trying to secure housing, particularly concerning the systems designed to assist them and the availability of adequate support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Difficulties with Priority Systems

A major challenge for homeless individuals seeking housing is navigating the [[priority_systems_for_housing_the_homeless | priority systems]] that determine who qualifies for immediate assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The current [[priority_systems_for_housing_the_homeless | priority system]] is described as catering to "middle class five," meaning individuals under 55 years old have "no chance" of being considered a priority case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This system often excludes those who can read and write, or who do not report serious health issues or suicidal ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. For example, a pregnant girl was informed she was a non-priority case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Ideally, someone who can prove they are homeless and have nowhere to live should be designated a priority case and housed within 28 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Lack of Caseworker Support

Another significant hurdle is the insufficient number of caseworkers available to assist homeless individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This shortage means fewer people are available to process cases and advocate for those in need, exacerbating the [[challenges_faced_by_homeless_individuals | challenges faced by homeless individuals]] in securing permanent housing.

## Current Shelter Conditions and Aspirations

In the absence of permanent housing, homeless individuals often rely on temporary shelters where they can obtain food and drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. At these centers, individuals typically have a box for personal belongings, one sleeping bag, one pillow, and a small mat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. There is a hope that future or reopened centers will provide better facilities, such as special lockers for personal items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. These conditions highlight the ongoing need for more stable and supportive housing solutions.

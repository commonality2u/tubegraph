The process of housing individuals experiencing homelessness often involves a priority system to determine who receives assistance first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The aim is for individuals deemed a priority case to be housed within close proximity, ideally within 28 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Criteria for Priority

Based on observations, the criteria for being considered a priority for housing support appear to favor individuals who are 55 years old or older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. If an individual is under 55, can read and write, and has no serious health issues, they are perceived to have "no chance" of being deemed a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. There is also an implication that individuals might feel compelled to state they are going to harm themselves to be considered a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Criticisms

A significant challenge within the system is the perceived lack of caseworkers or personnel to manage cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. An example cited involved a pregnant individual who was reportedly told she was "non-priority," despite her vulnerable situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This highlights concerns regarding how priority status is assigned and the impact on [[challenges_faced_by_homeless_individuals | vulnerable individuals]].

While awaiting permanent housing, individuals may reside in facilities like homeless centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. These centers provide basic necessities such as food, biscuits, and drinks, typically from around 8:30 or 9:00 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Individuals staying at the center keep their personal belongings in designated boxes, and are typically provided with one sleeping bag, one pillow, and a small mat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. There is a hope that future facilities will offer special lockers for personal items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Volunteers often assist at these centers, helping individuals and sharing their [[experiences_of_homeless_individuals | experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

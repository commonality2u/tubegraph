Running a 24/7 global live stream video channel offers several distinct advantages, particularly when leveraging semi-automation. This approach can redefine how content is delivered and managed, moving towards a "next generation of live on demand content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Reduced Management and Automation
A key benefit of a semiautomated live stream is that it can [[automation_tools_for_youtube_live_streaming | automate]] "quite a lot of the live stream that you don't have to manage it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This significantly reduces the manual effort required to keep the stream running continuously.

## Global Community and Moderation
A semiautomated 24/7 stream allows for the mobilization of "moderators around the world who are interested in what you're putting out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This global interest can lead to a dedicated community, with moderators helping to manage [[audience_engagement_and_community_management_for_live_streams | audience engagement and Community Management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, even across different time zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Personal TV Station Experience
The concept allows for "almost like everybody having their own TV station" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This vision suggests a future where individuals or small entities can broadcast their content continuously, much like traditional television channels, but with the flexibility and global reach of online platforms.

## Utilizing Open Source Content
There are specific "benefits of running a 24/7 semi-automated live stream from open source content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While the transcript does not elaborate on these specific benefits, it highlights the potential for using readily available content.

**Note:** Despite these benefits, it's crucial to be aware of [[common_issues_with_247_live_streaming | issues and problems]] that can arise with a 24/7 setup, such as internet connection loss, power failures, or hardware/software connection problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

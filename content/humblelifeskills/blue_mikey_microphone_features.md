The Blue Mikey is a portable microphone accessory designed by Blue Microphones, a company known for producing high-quality microphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It typically retails for approximately 60-70 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Design and Controls

The Blue Mikey features a positional design at its base, allowing it to be oriented in different ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It includes three sensitivity settings: very quiet, medium, and high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These settings are controlled by a small switch on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> The tiny switch on the back controlling sensitivity settings appears to be fragile and could break easily, suggesting it might need improvement in future versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Compatibility and Usage

The microphone connects to the bottom of an [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

*   **[[blue_mikey_compatibility_with_iphone_3g_and_ipod_touch | iPod Touch]]**: The Blue Mikey works natively with the [[blue_mikey_compatibility_with_iphone_3g_and_ipod_touch | iPod Touch]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **[[blue_mikey_compatibility_with_iphone_3g_and_ipod_touch | iPhone 3G]]**: Although it's not officially supposed to work on an [[blue_mikey_compatibility_with_iphone_3g_and_ipod_touch | iPhone 3G]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, it can be used with specific software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Without a dedicated application, plugging it into an [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] can produce an undesirable noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Recommended Application: Fire

To function properly with an [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]], the Blue Mikey requires an application like "Fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. When Fire boots up and the microphone is plugged in, the application will detect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The app may prompt the user about using the microphone for calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Performance

The Blue Mikey is described as quite sensitive, capable of picking up a voice from approximately a meter away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Its sensitivity makes it ideal for various recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The microphone's positional design allows for versatile use, such as standing it up or pointing it directly at a subject for recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

When used with the Fire application, the Blue Mikey enables users to make an unlimited number of recordings directly on the [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone]] without needing to upload files or have a data connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for [[using_irig_mic_hd_for_interviews_and_recording | conducting interviews]] without connectivity concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

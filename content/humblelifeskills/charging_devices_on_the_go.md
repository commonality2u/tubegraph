The Power Monkey Explorer is a portable charging solution designed for [[using_technology_during_travel | on-the-go]] use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It consists of two primary components: a solar cell and a main power unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Solar Cell Features
The solar cell component is foldable and can be hung from various places using a small hook, such as the back of a car or a backpack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. A green light on the unit indicates that it is detecting sunlight, even under cloudy conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It can also be placed in a window or, with prior permission, on the outside of an airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Main Power Unit
The main power unit is where the collected power is stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Users can check the current power level by pressing a button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The unit comes with a variety of [[device_connectivity_options | different connectors]], including one specifically for iPhone devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Charging Process
To charge devices, the solar cell is plugged into the main power unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The solar cell can be positioned outside, such as on a bag, while the main unit remains inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Once charged, the main unit can be connected to a device like an iPhone to provide power when a traditional power socket is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

DigiDoc3 is an application used for [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | digital signing]] of documents, particularly associated with [[estonias_digital_id_system | Estonia's digital ID system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It enables users to digitally sign documents as if they were signing something in person, leveraging the encryption of the [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | Estonian digital ID card]] for [[estonian_eresidency_digital_signing_capabilities | e-residency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Document Signing Process

To sign documents using DigiDoc3, users follow a series of steps:
1.  **Loading Documents** The application allows users to load documents, including those in DOCX format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The system supports [[process_of_digitally_signing_multiple_documents | bulk signing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
2.  **Output Folder Selection** Users must specify an output folder where the signed documents will be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
3.  **File Format** Signed documents are saved in the [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] format, which is the default [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | digital signature format]] in [[estonias_digital_id_system | Estonia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  **PIN Authentication** The signing process requires the use of PIN codes associated with the [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card | digital ID card]]:
    *   **PIN1** is used for digital authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
    *   **PIN2** is used for the digital signing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
5.  **Confirmation** Once the PIN2 code is entered, the application processes the documents, and they are marked as signed with a valid signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Features and Output Structure

*   **Signing Limits**: Users can digitally sign up to 10 signatures per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Batch Signing**: When [[process_of_digitally_signing_multiple_documents | signing multiple documents]] in a batch, DigiDoc3 appears to consolidate them into a single [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] format functions similarly to a zip file, containing the signed documents within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This implies that even if multiple files are loaded, the output for a batch may be a single [[b_doc_file_format_for_digital_signatures | B doc]] container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

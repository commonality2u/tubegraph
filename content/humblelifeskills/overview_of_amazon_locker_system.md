The Amazon Locker system is a service designed to allow customers to pick up their packages from a secure, self-service locker location, often situated in public places like shopping malls or stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Testing the System
The system was tested to evaluate the [[step_by_step_usage_of_amazon_lockers | experience]] of retrieving a package, rather than the usual method of receiving it directly at a studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The [[benefits_of_using_amazon_lockers | idea]] of picking up items after work at a shopping mall is appealing, as it allows for simultaneous shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Location
For this test, the Amazon Locker was located inside a Staples store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, which also had DHL services available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## [[experience_of_retrieving_packages_from_amazon_lockers | Package Retrieval Experience]]
Upon arrival, the Amazon Locker system features a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A "secret drawer" opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, and the screen indicated which specific locker held the package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The locker system itself is described as quite large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The package was retrieved from the bottom locker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The overall [[experience_of_retrieving_packages_from_amazon_lockers | experience]] was described as "no hassle, no bother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Discussions around social interactions often delve into the fundamental role of politeness and its impact on personal relationships and broader [[Community Building and Communication | community dynamics]]. The perceived value and utility of polite language, as well as the contrasting behavior seen in online environments, are explored.

## The Role of Politeness in Everyday Life

The application of polite language in daily interactions is considered, particularly the traditional use of words like "please" and "thank you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

### The "Please" and "Thank You" Inquiry

A question is raised about whether the use of "please" and "thank you" genuinely alters an outcome or if the action would occur regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. It is pondered whether the inclusion of such words has a significant impact on life in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

### The Principle of Reciprocity

A belief is expressed that politeness and positive conduct often yield beneficial returns, suggesting a "full circle" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. The idea is that "if you're good to people or if you're honest with people or whatever they normally... are normally quite you know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. This implies that being friendly tends to elicit friendliness in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

## Contrasting Online Behavior

The [[internet_behavior_and_culture_regarding_criticism_and_haters | internet]] presents a different landscape for social interaction, often characterized by negativity and criticism, which stands in contrast to the principles of politeness discussed.

### The Phenomenon of Online "Haters"

The presence of "haters" online is observed, described as individuals who "diss" or criticize others, particularly those who demonstrate a capability or talent they themselves lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. This behavior is labeled as unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

### Motivation Behind Online Negativity

Speculation arises regarding the motivations of online "haters":
> "Why there's so many haters out there on the internet is it because they just sit there bored out out of their heads all day and they want to diss anything that they haven't got or or what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>

It is suggested that such behavior is not beneficial and does not help anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

## General Observations on [[Social media interaction and community engagement | Online Content Consumption]]

The [[conversations_about_internet_trends_and_media_consumption | internet]] is noted as a "strange place for information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Users often gravitate towards "way out" content, but also engage with seemingly "lame" material, sometimes making a significant deal out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. This highlights the varied and often unpredictable nature of [[discussion_on_why_people_enjoy_certain_internet_personalities | public interest in internet personalities]] and content.

After completing the [[eresidency_application_process|e-residency application process]], applicants are notified when their [[features_and_uses_of_the_estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card|digital ID card]] is ready for collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This marks a key step in the overall [[process_of_obtaining_an_estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card|process of obtaining an Estonian e-residency digital ID card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Notification of Collection Readiness

An email is sent approximately 25 days into the [[process_of_obtaining_an_estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card|e-residency process]], indicating that the digital ID card is ready for collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. This notification typically arrives well within a month of the initial application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This follows earlier emails confirming application receipt by the Estonian Police and Border Guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a> and the granting of the e-residency application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## Card Collection Logistics

To collect the digital ID card, individuals must travel to an Estonian embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. For a UK resident, this involves traveling to the Estonian embassy in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. The actual [[experience_of_visiting_the_embassy_to_collect_the_digital_id_card|experience of visiting the embassy to collect the digital ID card]], including the "unboxing" of the card, is typically documented in a subsequent video or guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:52">[01:28:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, providing further details on [[instructions for setting up and using the digital ID card|setting up and using the digital ID card]], and its capabilities for tasks like [[digital_signature_using_an_estonian_digital_id_card|digital signatures]] and [[using_eresidency_as_a_login_partner_for_online_services|using eresidency as a login partner for online services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

A quick episode read on "dig" described a London cab driver who unexpectedly ended up on BBC Radio [00:00:46].

## The Broadcast Mishap
The London cabbie somehow managed to get onto Radio One [00:01:06]. The interviewer was scheduled to connect with the inventor of MP3 or someone knowledgeable about MP3 technology [00:01:09]. However, this live radio interview featured the cab driver instead [00:01:20].

## The Cab Driver's Role
The cab driver was on air for "five or 6 minutes" [00:01:22]. During this time, he "bled it for 5 6 minutes" and "obviously didn't know what it was on about" [00:01:27], leading to a notable mix-up.

> [!NOTE]
> It was suggested that many London cabbies might possess extensive knowledge about the world, given they pick up diverse individuals like accountants and lawyers daily [01:01:38].

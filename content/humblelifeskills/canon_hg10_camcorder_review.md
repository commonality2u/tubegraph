## Image and Video Quality
The [[image_and_video_quality_of_canon_hg10 | definition]] produced by the Canon HG10 is highly praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, with observations noting "incredibly good detail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The camera's optics are described as "amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The camcorder also excels in still image capture, producing "very good snaps" with effective background blurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Low Light Performance
In relatively low lighting conditions, the Canon HG10 performs "pretty good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, even when it's "pretty dark really" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Overall, the [[image_and_video_quality_of_canon_hg10 | image quality]] in these conditions is considered "pretty good" and "impressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Autofocus
The autofocus system on the HG10 is noted for its speed, with subjects "snapping into focus" quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This quick focus is compared to a similar behavior observed on the [[comparison_between_canon_hg10_and_canon_hv20 | Canon HV20]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Build and Features
The screen on the Canon HG10 is described as "really sharp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While Canon is known for its strong optics, the robustness of their camera bodies, even for amateur-aimed DSLRs, is noted as potentially not being as strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## User Experience
The camcorder is assessed for its usability at arm's length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

In early 2015, the speaker expressed intentions to start a small business venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## Business Venture

The specific type of business is not fully detailed, but it involves an offering that includes a bed, curtains, and a heater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. These items were reportedly "booked out" over the New Year's period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The speaker noted the items were "really nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, with a base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> and double glazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Plans included taking photos of the setup as the sun was coming up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, believing they would make good images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

> This video was recorded on January 2, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The speaker intended to post a separate video about this business venture soon after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Operational Considerations

### Data Costs
A significant operational consideration for the speaker was the cost of mobile data. In eight days, 10GB of data was consumed, costing £30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This usage, primarily for browsing and watching videos, was deemed expensive if it continued weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. To address this, a monthly paid tariff was considered a more cost-effective solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. A 50GB 4G plan for £50 per month was identified as a potentially good option, which could support the new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. This demonstrates an early focus on [[managing_spending_habits | managing spending habits]] related to business operations.

### Content Strategy for Online Presence
The speaker expressed strong focus on YouTube and Udemy in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. A strategy for content creation involves translating video transcripts into blog posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The process would involve ripping text from videos or translating it into English to create blog posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This approach allows for blogging as long as one can talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The speaker plans to use services like Fiverr to transcribe or translate videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, aiming for blog posts of 2,000 words or more, which are favored by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The goal is to upload YouTube videos with corresponding text underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This strategy was planned for the subsequent months to explore its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

Max Self-Defense offers training focused on having fun while addressing a serious subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The organization is run by Mark Wingfield and Mark Ram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Training Reach and Philosophy
Max Self-Defense provides "very simple effective self-defense training" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While based in the East Midlands, they are able to travel anywhere across the UK and also have opportunities in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Their approach involves taking "the easiest most practical elements of martial arts" and combining them to create highly [[practical_self_defense_techniques | practical self-defense techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This highlights the [[application_of_martial_arts_in_self_defense | Application of Martial Arts in Self Defense]] for real-world scenarios.

## Benefits of Training
The training ensures that individuals, including staff, loved ones, partners, or oneself, can stay safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Beyond personal safety, Max Self-Defense effectively facilitates [[team_building_through_self_defense | team building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Participants bond with colleagues by engaging in activities like "whacking those bags," enjoying themselves, and relieving stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The program aims to bring out the best in people, fostering a great deal of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. It prepares individuals for conflict, with the hope that they can walk away from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The training is compared to first aid: "if you need it, it's there in the reserve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Key Techniques: The Fence
Mark Ram provides a brief outline of "the fence," a core concept in [[introduction_to_max_self_defense | Max Self-Defense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Staying Back (The Fence)
This technique involves creating distance and de-escalation:
*   When confronted by an aggressor, one steps back and uses a verbal command like "stay back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   This posture keeps the aggressor at bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   If an attack does occur, this position allows for a cover and a counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Pleading (The Fence)
Another part of "the fence" is called "the pleading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, where the aim is to make the aggressor believe they are in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This is demonstrated by putting hands up to protect the face and asking, "what's your problem mate," without appearing to be about to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

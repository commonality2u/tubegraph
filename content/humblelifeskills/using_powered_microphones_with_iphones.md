The iPhone, specifically the iPhone 3G, can be used for [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | recording audio on mobile devices]] with external XLR microphones, offering better quality sound compared to the iPhone's built-in microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48"></a>. This setup allows for broadcast-quality audio while on the move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>.

## Required Equipment

To connect an XLR microphone to an iPhone, a specific custom cable is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17"></a>. This cable, available from sources like "your custom cable.com", features a "three stripe connector" designed for the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22"></a>. This solution enables [[xlr_to_iphone_connection | XLR to iPhone connection]] and enhances [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone compatibility with microphones]] for external audio devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41"></a>.

## Connection Process

The connection process involves a specific order:
1.  First, plug the custom cable's iPhone connector into the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28"></a>.
2.  Then, attach the XLR microphone to the cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41"></a>.
    *   It is important not to connect the XLR microphone to the cable first before plugging the cable into the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35"></a>.

## Microphone Compatibility and Power

Not all XLR microphones are compatible with this setup; users need either a dynamic microphone or a powered microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02"></a>. The custom cable itself often contains a power source, such as a 1.5-volt AA battery, to facilitate the connection and power requirements of the microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07"></a>. This provides [[compatibility_with_xlr_microphones | compatibility with XLR microphones]] that require power.

## Recording Applications

Once connected, applications like "Audio Boo" or "Fire the Road" can be used for recording audio on the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50"></a>. This allows for [[using_external_microphones_with_iphone | using external microphones with iPhone]] for high-quality audio capture.

gpodder is an application designed for [[subscribing_to_and_managing_podcasts_with_gpodder | downloading and managing free audio and video podcasts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. It supports subscribing to various feeds, including RSS, Atom, YouTube, SoundCloud, and Vimeo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It is available across multiple platforms, including Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and Mac OSX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The official source for the application is gpodder.org <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Why Use gpodder for YouTube Content?

A primary reason for using gpodder is to overcome the high cost and inconvenience of downloading content directly via a cellular connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Data plans can be expensive; for instance, 10 gigabytes of data might cost 30 pounds, making direct YouTube video downloads a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The recommended approach is to download content when connected to a fast Wi-Fi network, such as a co-working space that offers a gigabit connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A gigabit connection can provide impressive speeds, with latency as low as 4 milliseconds and download speeds reaching 836 Mbps, along with similarly fast upload speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

By pre-downloading videos on a fast connection, users can then [[watching_downloaded_content_offline | watch the content offline]] at their convenience, such as in an RV or caravan, without consuming their cellular data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## How to Download YouTube Videos with gpodder

### Subscribing to a YouTube Channel
1.  Copy the URL of the desired YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
2.  In gpodder, select the "Add podcast via URL" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
3.  Paste the copied URL and click "Add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Checking for and Downloading Episodes
Once subscribed, gpodder will indicate "new episodes available" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. To download all available videos from a channel, click the "Download" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

To update all subscriptions, use the "check for new episodes" function, which updates feeds and identifies new videos for download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Managing Downloads
While gpodder can handle multiple downloads concurrently, it's recommended to limit simultaneous downloads to around 10, especially on systems like an iMac with 16GB of memory, to ensure smooth operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Despite a fast connection, gpodder might not always utilize the full gigabit bandwidth and may download around 10 megabits per second per file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Post-Download Actions
After downloading, videos can be watched offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While watching offline, direct commenting isn't possible. To comment, users can click on a video within gpodder, view its episode details, and jump directly to the original source online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This method conserves bandwidth by only accessing the online platform for commenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Configuration
gpodder offers extensive settings for customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Users can specify their preferred video format, such as MP4 4K for the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, and also set a preferred HD video format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

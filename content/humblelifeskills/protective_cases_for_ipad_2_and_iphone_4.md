Protecting mobile hardware on the go is crucial to prevent damage to equipment while mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article examines various protective cases for iPads and iPhones, as well as general tough cases for everyday items.

## Griffin Survivor Case for iPad 2

The Griffin Survivor case is a robust protective solution for the iPad 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Design and Assembly
The case is designed as a "wrap" that splits apart into multiple components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It includes a plastic membrane outer cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> and an internal plastic cage where the iPad 2 sits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The outer cover is cut to fit all ports, making them dust-proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. While not fully waterproof, it is considered splash-proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Assembling the case involves pressing down on each bit until it clicks into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The iPad 2 literally sits inside the plastic sleeve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Features
The case incorporates an integrated kickstand that allows the iPad 2 to stand upright or be angled for viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A transparent plastic sheet forms the top case, protecting the screen and the front camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Users can touch through this screen protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The bottom of the case features an audio slit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The back of the case covers the charging port, audio port, and camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Overall, the case provides an extra level of protection for devices that are not cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Limitations
The case significantly increases the size of the iPad 2, which is originally super slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. A key [[limitations_of_using_protective_cases_for_gaming | limitation of using protective cases for gaming]] is that it reduces screen sensitivity, making gaming, such as with Grand Theft Auto 3, difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The transparent plastic sheet can also get mucky and requires periodic cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The camera cover at the top can be inconvenient, as it needs to be held back for shooting video or taking photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. For users who don't anticipate much dust, cutting off this particular cover might be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### User Experience
The case is considered "very very hardcore" and "really secure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The decision to purchase such an "extreme case" was motivated by an incident where an iPad 2 was smashed after only a week of use at South by Southwest Eco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The case has proven to be brilliant, having protected the device after being dropped and slipping out of a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Case Mate Tank Case for iPhone 4

The Case Mate Tank case provides similar protection for the iPhone 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Features
A notable [[case_mate_tank_case_features_for_iphone_4 | feature of the Case Mate Tank case]] is its sliding screen cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This cover scrambles the screen, making it difficult to read and offering privacy for sensitive communications in public settings like a coffee shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The case is made of "really really strong plastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> and provides front protection as the screen cover folds into itself when pressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Removal and Re-assembly
To remove the iPhone 4, the case simply pulls off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It has a button at the bottom and two buttons on the back that are pressed down while pulling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This allows the iPhone 4 to be easily taken out for use with accessories like a Glyph or tripod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. To put it back, the iPhone slots into the bottom piece, ensuring the edges and back clips line up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## General Tough Case for Cards

Beyond devices, protecting other essential items is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. A "super tough case" designed to withstand being driven over is used to store cards like loyalty and business cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This type of case, costing around $10, is waterproof, preventing cards from breaking, getting scratched up, or appearing grubby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. For individuals who rely heavily on these cards, such protection is highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Ultimately, it is important to consider [[importance_of_mobile_device_protection | protecting your kit]] when mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

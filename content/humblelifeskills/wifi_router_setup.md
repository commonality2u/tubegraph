## Initial Home Setup

A WiFi router allows for internet connectivity on devices like phones throughout a downstairs area [00:00:12] [00:00:17] [00:00:20].

## Challenges with Mobile Data Costs

Relying solely on a home wireless network means needing to return home to send files or clips [00:00:34] [00:00:39] [00:00:42]. This is often preferred over using expensive mobile data packages from providers like Orange [00:00:43] [00:00:45].

## [[extending_wifi_range | Extending WiFi Range]] and [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | WiFi Cloud]] Concept

To overcome the limitation of needing to be home for network access, there is an interest in [[extending_wifi_range | broadening the WiFi range]] [00:00:50] [00:00:51]. It is possible to [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | set up a WiFi cloud]] [00:00:56].

### [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | WiFi Cloud]] Implementation Ideas

For a house, a device could be placed on the side of the building, with wiring run from the loft [00:01:00] [00:01:01] [00:01:04] [00:01:07]. To create a [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | WiFi cloud]], a [[authentication_using_radius_for_wifi_service | Radius server]] is required [00:01:08] [00:01:10]. The user possesses 19-inch rack servers that could be used for this purpose [00:01:11] [00:01:12].

A WiFi aerial, such as a flat panel or a standard aerial, can be used for transmission [00:01:26] [00:01:28] [00:01:30] [00:01:32]. With a good line of sight or a sufficiently high pole, it's possible to transmit signals up to five to ten miles [00:01:34] [00:01:37] [00:01:38] [00:01:41] [00:01:42].

### [[authentication_using_radius_for_wifi_service | Authentication]] Requirements

For a public service, [[authentication_using_radius_for_wifi_service | authentication]] can be implemented using [[authentication_using_radius_for_wifi_service | Radius]] [00:01:43] [00:01:45]. This would allow for user-specific logins [00:01:47] [00:01:48] and enable advertising the service for people to get online without incurring high costs [00:01:49] [00:01:51] [00:01:58] [00:02:00].

Custom cable manufacturers offer specialized solutions for [[using_external_microphones_with_iphone | connecting external microphones to iPhones]], including those requiring [[xlr_to_iphone_connection | XLR to iPhone connections]]. These companies focus on providing cables cut to exact specifications, regardless of length, to meet the unique needs of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Custom Cable Manufacturing
The process of producing custom cables begins with customers contacting the manufacturer with their specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. While a standard connection might seem simple, specialized needs often require more intricate planning and assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Small custom cables can be assembled in approximately 5 to 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The strength of these companies lies in their ability to make cables custom to any length, such as 27 centimeters, precisely fitting the user's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This approach is more cost-effective for customers in the long run, as traditional companies often only offer cables in fixed lengths like 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. By cutting from large rolls, manufacturers can utilize leftover pieces for other custom orders, minimizing waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Larger, more complex systems, such as thick cables running from stages to mixing consoles for big concerts, can take about three weeks to build and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. These specialized orders often involve extensive planning and assembly, as they cater to specific and sometimes unique requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## iPhone Compatibility Challenges and Solutions
One common issue encountered when connecting [[using_external_microphones_with_iphone | external microphones]] like the Rode to an iPhone is unintended music playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This problem arises because the iPhone's bundled headset includes volume and track-skip buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. When the headset is unplugged, a residual current on the four-pin connector can inadvertently trigger music playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

A suggested solution for this issue is to first disconnect the microphone from its cable (e.g., the Rode mic itself) and *then* unplug the four-pin connector from the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This sequence helps prevent the residual current from activating music playback.

### Monitoring Audio with iPhone Adapters
Another challenge with [[iphone_compatibility_with_microphones | iPhone compatibility with microphones]] involves simultaneous recording and headphone monitoring, particularly with adapters designed for [[xlr_to_iphone_connection | XLR to iPhone connections]]. The main difficulty is the limited space within the adapter plug to integrate an additional jack for headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Manufacturers are exploring making a very small cable with a jack, but it's uncertain if the iPhone will output a monitoring signal through the four-pin connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

To test this, users can record with the iPhone's internal microphone while headphones are plugged in; if they can hear themselves, it indicates that the audio is passing through the four-pin connector and monitoring is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. However, it is noted that direct monitoring might only be possible after the recording, for playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Company Background
YourCustomCable.com, founded two years prior to this discussion, began by selling cables online before launching its own website due to strong demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The company's founders have a background in audio tech, having worked on rock concerts and similar events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The owner, a former drummer, transitioned into audio engineering before starting the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The company anticipates rapid growth in the coming years and plans to expand its personnel, with the owner's wife managing administration and web design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

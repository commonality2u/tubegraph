The creators of this show aim for nonconformity in media production, explicitly stating that their content is not designed to adhere to conventional regulations or be broadcast on traditional television platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Production Philosophy
The show's core philosophy centers on the ability to independently release episodes whenever convenient for the creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This approach contrasts sharply with the structured release schedules of traditional television, highlighting a commitment to [[challenges_in_content_creation_and_distribution | overcoming challenges in content creation and distribution]] outside mainstream channels.

## The Future: IPTV
The show positions itself as part of the "future" of media, specifically mentioning "IPTV" (Internet Protocol Television) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This emphasizes a shift from traditional broadcasting to internet-based content delivery, a key aspect of [[comparing_television_and_internet_video_experiences | comparing television and internet video experiences]].

## Funding and Knowledge Advancement
To further their capabilities in online media and "give back online," the creators are seeking donations to attend an "emerging technology conference" by O'Reilly in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. They clarify that the funds are for knowledge advancement, not personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Privacy and Freedom of Information
The show touches upon broader themes related to nonconformity, including concerns about surveillance laws and personal privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This concern stems from foundational beliefs, reminiscent of discussions at a hacker's conversation in Amsterdam in 1997 regarding PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. These past [[conversations_about_internet_trends_and_media_consumption | conversations about internet trends and media consumption]] were defining moments that shaped their views on privacy and independent information dissemination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

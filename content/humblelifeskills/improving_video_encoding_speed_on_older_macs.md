Many older Mac computers can benefit from hardware accelerators to improve video encoding speed, especially when dealing with high-definition video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. As CPU technology advances, older machines may struggle with the demands of modern video encoding, leading to long processing times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Elgato Turbo 264 HD

A solution for this issue is the [[optimizing_video_quality_with_the_elgato_turbo_264_hd | Elgato Turbo 264 HD]], a hardware USB stick designed for faster video encoding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This device is specifically engineered to accelerate H.264 video encoding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. H.264 is the standard codec and compression format used for most video content on the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

In the UK, the [[optimizing_video_quality_with_the_elgato_turbo_264_hd | Elgato Turbo 264 HD]] costs around 80-90 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, and in the US, approximately $80-90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Benefits of the Elgato Turbo 264 HD

*   **Faster Encoding**: The device can encode video up to four times faster than relying solely on the computer's CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Reduced CPU Load**: It features a dedicated chip that handles the video encoding job, offloading the processing from your computer's CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This means your computer won't slow down while encoding, allowing you to perform other tasks simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This is particularly useful for [[optimizing_cpu_usage_while_recording_and_encoding | optimizing CPU usage while recording and encoding]] on older systems or laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **High-Quality Output**: When used with applications like iMovie '11, it can produce really good quality video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **HD Encoding Support**: It supports encoding to HD resolutions, including 720p and 1080p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Convenient Upload Options**: The device can also encode and directly upload videos to YouTube accounts or FTP servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This is useful for quickly uploading finished edits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Custom Settings**: Users can create their own custom settings to tweak audio and video outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. It also supports FTP protocol for direct uploads to services that can further encode and distribute videos to multiple platforms like Blip TV, Wistia, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Setup and Usage

Setting up the [[optimizing_video_quality_with_the_elgato_turbo_264_hd | Elgato Turbo 264 HD]] is a quick process, typically taking only two to three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
1.  Install the software from the included CD and enter the serial codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  Connect the simple USB stick piece of hardware, optionally using the included USB extender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

When performing an encoding job, such as exporting video from iMovie '11, the device integrates directly into the export options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
1.  In iMovie '11, right-click on your project and select "Export using [[using_quicktime_with_elgato_turbo_264_hd | QuickTime]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
2.  In the export dropdown, you will find an option for the [[optimizing_video_quality_with_the_elgato_turbo_264_hd | Elgato Turbo 264 HD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  Underneath, you can select from preset settings for devices like iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, or choose HD resolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
4.  Once you click save, a red light on the [[optimizing_video_quality_with_the_elgato_turbo_264_hd | Elgato]] unit will illuminate, indicating that it is actively processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

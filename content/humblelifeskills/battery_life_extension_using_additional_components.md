The [[tekkeon_3450i_lithium_polymer_battery_features | Tekkeon 3450i]] is a 58-watt [[advantages_of_lithium_polymer_batteries | lithium polymer battery]] designed for portable power needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This type of [[advantages_of_lithium_polymer_batteries | lithium polymer battery]] is noted for its enhanced [[battery_performance_in_various_conditions | performance in cold weather and in heat]], retaining its charge more effectively than many other products due to its polymer wrapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The device also includes a small fan at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Features and Models

The [[tekkeon_3450i_lithium_polymer_battery_features | Tekkeon 3450i]] features include:
*   A connector for USB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   An on/off switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Dip switch settings for various voltages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   A button press provides an indicator of the charge level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

While the specific model discussed is the 3450r, there is also a 3750 model which offers USB-only connectivity and auto-detection capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The battery unit itself is enclosed in a polymer material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Real-world Performance

The [[tekkeon_3450i_lithium_polymer_battery_features | Tekkeon 3450i]] has demonstrated robust performance in demanding conditions. For instance, it successfully powered a [[battery_and_power_options_for_cradlepoint | Cradlepoint PHS 300]] for approximately a day and a half while stored in a rucksack during South by Southwest in Austin, even in extremely hot weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Its power delivery was consistently reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Battery Life Extension

A key feature for extending battery life is the availability of an adapter bracket that allows a second battery to be attached underneath the main unit, effectively doubling its operational life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. With this extension, and conservative use, the system could potentially run for up to a week in a portable setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These batteries are noted to work perfectly with the [[battery_and_power_options_for_cradlepoint | Cradlepoint]] devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

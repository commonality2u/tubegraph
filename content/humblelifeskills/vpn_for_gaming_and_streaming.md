A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can serve multiple purposes for online users, including enhancing security and improving performance for activities like gaming and live streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. Beyond general [[vpn_and_data_privacy | data privacy]] concerns, such as preventing ISPs and governments from accessing log files and preventing targeted advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>, a VPN provides an additional layer of encrypted security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>.

For live streamers and gamers, VPNs can offer resilience against Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which aim to knock users offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>. By routing data through an encrypted tunnel, a VPN can reduce the attack surface of a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>.

## Speedify

Speedify is a unique VPN client that offers the ability to [[vpn_connection_bonding | bond multiple internet connections]] together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>.

### Connection Bonding
This feature is beneficial for users with more than one internet connection, such as a 4G unlimited tether plan on a phone or multiple Ethernet connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:17">[03:06:17]</a>. Speedify can combine these connections to provide a faster and more reliable internet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:53">[03:20:53]</a>.

Speedify offers two modes for combining connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>:
*   **Speed Boost:** Uses connections together for both reliability and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Redundant Mode:** Sends all traffic across each connection to improve reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:05">[03:35:05]</a>.

It supports bonding up to 10 devices, requiring multiple Wi-Fi networks or interfaces (e.g., USB Wi-Fi adapters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This capability could enable "super fast internet" by combining multiple 4G SIMs from different providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, creating redundancy for mission-critical video streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.

### VPN Features
Speedify also functions as a traditional VPN, allowing users to connect to servers in the closest country or select from a wide range of popular countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:12">[04:57:12]</a>. It also offers dedicated PTP (Peer-to-Peer) servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

### Performance for Streaming
While potentially offering lower download speeds (e.g., 20-24 Mbps down) compared to other VPNs, Speedify generally provides stable ping times (e.g., 38-39 milliseconds) and good upload speeds (e.g., 40-60 Mbps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. This performance is considered perfect for live streaming and gaming due to its consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

## IBVPN

IBVPN is another VPN provider that offers a range of services, including support for various [[different_vpn_protocols_and_their_uses | VPN protocols]] and specialized servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

### Protocol Support
IBVPN supports four different [[different_vpn_protocols_and_their_uses | VPN protocols]], each offering different compression or speed benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. OpenVPN is one such protocol frequently used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

### Server Infrastructure
IBVPN provides numerous servers globally, including dedicated P2P servers and the option for "double VPN" (bouncing traffic through two locations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. They also offer dedicated "gaming" servers, such as one in the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

### Performance for Gaming
Connecting to a dedicated gaming server with IBVPN (e.g., Netherlands server via OpenVPN) can result in significantly higher download speeds (e.g., 45 Mbps) compared to other VPNs or direct connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. However, this often comes with a higher ping (e.g., 55 milliseconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

The reason for these high speeds is that these gaming servers are typically hosted on incredibly fast backbones within data centers with "fatpipe" connections (huge capacity from multiple providers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. Additionally, the game servers themselves are often co-located on the same network as the VPN server, minimizing additional "hops" or latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. This optimization makes them ideal for specific games like Battlefield 1, where the game servers are on the same network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

### Limitations for Streaming
While excellent for gaming, these dedicated gaming VPN connections may not be suitable for other activities like live streaming, as they can be optimized specifically for gaming traffic and may cause disconnections after a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

## Choosing the Right VPN

The optimal VPN choice depends on the specific use case, making it "a bit of an art form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   **Speedify** is generally preferred for daily browsing, websites, YouTube, and Twitch/Beam.pro streaming due to its consistency and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.
*   **IBVPN's dedicated gaming servers** are ideal specifically for gaming where low latency to the game server is crucial, even if the overall ping is slightly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_vpn_on_latency_and_speed | Impact of VPN on Latency and Speed]]

Ping and latency are critical factors, especially for gaming and live streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   **Ping:** Represents the turnaround time for data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Latency:** The delay in data transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

For optimal gaming, pings below 50 milliseconds are desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. Ethernet connections typically achieve 10-15 milliseconds, while local area networks (LANs) can be as low as 2-3 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. A stable ping of 38 milliseconds is considered "rock solid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

## Security Considerations for Live Streamers

Beyond general VPN protection, streamers should be cautious about interaction in chat boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **IP Address Exposure:** Some methods of connecting to chats can reveal a streamer's host IP address, allowing malicious users to perform "finger" queries or flood the IP address, leading to a denial of service and knocking the stream offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.
*   **Mitigation:** It is recommended to use moderators or a proxy to connect to the chat to prevent direct IP exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

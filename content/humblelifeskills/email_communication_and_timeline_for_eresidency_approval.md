The process of obtaining an [[what_is_eresidency | e-residency]] digital ID card involves several stages of communication via email, typically unfolding within a month of the initial application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Initial Application and Acknowledgment

The application process begins with submission and payment. For one applicant, this occurred on January 31st, which was the last day the [[cost_and_pricing_changes_for_eresidency | e-residency]] card cost €50; the price subsequently increased to €100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Soon after, the first email is received, acknowledging that the application has been received and that the e-residency team will be in touch shortly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Police and Border Guard Review

Little under a week after the initial acknowledgment, a second email is sent confirming that the application has been received by the Estonian Police and Border Guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Granting of E-residency

Approximately 10 days into the overall [[eresidency_application_process | application process]], and about 5 days after the previous email, a third email is sent to inform the applicant that the e-residency has been granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

> [!INFO] Rejection Rate
> Approximately 1% of e-residency applications are turned down, indicating a very small margin of rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Card Ready for Collection

After the granting of e-residency, there might be a period of silence in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, an email confirming that the [[process_of_obtaining_an_estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card | digital ID card]] is ready for collection typically arrives on day 25 of the process, roughly two weeks after the granting email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The [[collection_process_for_the_eresidency_digital_id_card | digital ID card]] must then be collected in person, for instance, at the Estonian embassy in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The entire process of email communication and approval occurs within one month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

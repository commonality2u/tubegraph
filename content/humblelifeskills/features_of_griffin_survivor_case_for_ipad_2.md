The [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | Griffin Survivor case]] is a robust protective solution for the [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPad 2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is designed to safeguard mobile hardware when on the go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The speaker purchased this extreme case after smashing their [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPad 2]] at South by Southwest Eco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Design and Construction
The case is described as a "wrap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> and consists of multiple layers to provide comprehensive protection:
*   **Outer Plastic Cover:** This main cover is adorned with dust-proof port cutouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While not fully waterproof, it offers splash-proof capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Inner Plastic Cage:** The [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPad 2]] sits securely inside this plastic cage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Transparent Plastic Sheet:** This sheet forms the top case and protects the screen and front camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The screen remains touch-sensitive through the sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Key Features
*   **Integrated Kickstand:** The case features an integrated kickstand that allows the [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPad 2]] to stand upright or lean at an angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Port Protection:** All ports, including the charging port and audio port, are covered by the plastic casing, making them dust-proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Camera Protection:** The front camera is protected by the transparent plastic sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The rear camera also has a cover, which can be a "faff" if constantly shooting video or photos, potentially requiring it to be held open or even cut off if dust isn't a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Security:** The case is described as "very very hardcore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> and provides a significant level of protection, making it "brilliant" for safeguarding the device against drops and slips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Considerations
*   **Increased Size:** The case "increases the size massively" of the [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPad 2]], which is originally super slim, potentially defeating the purpose for users who prioritize thinness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Screen Muckiness:** The transparent plastic screen protector can become "mucky," requiring periodic removal and cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **[[limitations_of_using_protective_cases_for_gaming | Gaming Sensitivity]]:** One notable drawback is that the case is "not a great case" for [[limitations_of_using_protective_cases_for_gaming | gaming]] as it reduces screen sensitivity, impacting controls for games like Grand Theft Auto 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Assembly
Disassembling and reassembling the case involves pulling apart the plastic membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. To put the [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPad 2]] back in, it literally sits inside the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, and the top case clicks into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. There are specific areas on the frame that need to be pressed to ensure it sits correctly inside the plastic holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

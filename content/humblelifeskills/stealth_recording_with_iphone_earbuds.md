The latest iPhone earbud headphones offer a unique, albeit limited, option for [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | capturing stealth audio on the go]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Features of iPhone Earbuds

While described as "really, really uncomfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, the latest iPhone earbud headphones come equipped with an inline control featuring plus and minus buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Crucially, this inline control also integrates a microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## How to Perform Stealth Recordings

This built-in microphone allows for "stealth recordings with audio boost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. To use this feature:
1.  Wear the earbuds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
2.  Start an audio recording application, such as Audioboo, on your iPhone while it's in your pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
3.  Record the desired audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## Limitations

It's important to note that the audio quality produced by this method is "not great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. However, it remains a viable option for [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | capturing stealth audio on the go]] when higher-quality equipment is not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

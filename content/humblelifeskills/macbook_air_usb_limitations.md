MacBook Air users often face challenges due to having a limited number of USB ports, typically only one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This can make it difficult to connect multiple peripherals simultaneously.

## The Roto Block USB Hub

A practical solution for expanding connectivity on a MacBook Air is a device known as the "Roto block," which functions as a [[usb_hub_functionality | USB hub combo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Design and Features

This square-block-shaped hub is designed for versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>:
*   It can be connected at various angles, including sideways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   The [[rotating_usb_ports | USB ports rotate outwards]], allowing them to be set at different angles, which helps in connecting devices without obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This flexibility means peripherals can be connected at virtually any desired angle, avoiding common frustrations with fixed USB port orientations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   It includes a comprehensive card reader that supports multiple formats, including XD, SD, MMC, T-Flash, and MS cards, with card reader slots located on all sides of the block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Availability and Quality

The Roto block can be sourced from places like China and is available for approximately Â£10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. While its build quality is not considered brilliant, it is expected to be sufficient for its intended purpose over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Working with [[hd_video_quality | HD]] video files presents significant storage challenges due to their incredibly large sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This necessitates expanding storage capacity, as existing drives can quickly become full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The Challenge of Large Files

For example, a collection of 99 video clips taken for South by Southwest occupied 60 gigabytes of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This usage quickly depletes available storage, leaving only about 90 gigabytes remaining on a drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. A Mac Pro, already equipped with two 500 gigabyte drives, totaling one terabyte of storage, was nearly full due to [[hd_video_quality | HD]] files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Storage Solutions and Preferences

To address these challenges, installing additional internal hard drives is a common solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Internal vs. External Drives

Internal drives, costing around Â£60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, are preferred over external hard drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Personal experience suggests external drives are prone to failure, with two failing within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This is attributed to potential overheating and lower quality drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Apple's Time Capsule, marketed as a server-grade hard drive, may offer a solution to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Preferred Internal Drives

Western Digital Caviar drives, specifically 500 gigabyte SATA models, are noted for their speed and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The Mac Pro offers four drive bays, allowing for easy expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Installing a new drive in a Mac Pro is straightforward; it slides into a tray without needing to connect cables or configure master/slave settings, unlike some PC setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Once installed, the Mac detects the drive, and it can be formatted using a disk utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

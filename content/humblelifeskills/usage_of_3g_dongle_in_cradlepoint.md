The [[Cradlepoint PHS300 features | Cradlepoint PHS300]] is a wireless hotspot router designed to facilitate mobile internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It enables users to connect a 3G dongle or other mobile data cards to create a personal [[using_wifi_and_mobile_data_for_connectivity|wireless network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Connectivity and Compatibility
*   **USB Connection** The PHS300 features a USB connector specifically for attaching a 3G dongle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. These dongles typically have a round or oblong shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **PCMCIA Card Support** An adapter can also be connected to support PCMCIA cards, such as EVDO cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Device Support** Users should consult the Cradlepoint website to verify compatibility, as the device supports a specific range of 3G dongles and HSDPA connectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The list of supported devices is regularly updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **SIM Card Usage** Once a dongle is connected, it can be equipped with a SIM card, including international unlimited SIMs, to establish internet connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Features and Operation
*   **Personal Wireless Hotspot** The Cradlepoint PHS300 creates a personal [[using_wifi_and_mobile_data_for_connectivity|wireless hotspot]] that can be password protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Wipipe Technology** The device incorporates [[wipipe_technology_in_wireless_hotspots|Wipipe technology]], functioning similarly to a home broadband router but with battery operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Web Interface** A simple web interface allows users to configure settings such as the Wi-Fi channel and encryption type (e.g., 64-bit, 128-bit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Firmware Updates** Firmware updates often introduce new features, such as GPS tracking, which can allow the device to constantly broadcast its GPS location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Power and Portability
*   **Battery Life** The internal battery typically lasts for 3 to 4 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **External Power** For extended use, the PHS300 can be connected to an external power unit, such as a Teon power unit, which can provide power for a day and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The DC input for the Teon unit is 5 Volts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

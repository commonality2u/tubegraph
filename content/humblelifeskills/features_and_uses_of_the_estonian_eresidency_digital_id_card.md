The [[Estonias digital ID system | Estonian digital ID card]], also known as the e-residency card, functions as a robust digital identification for non-residents of Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It does not confer physical residency, voting rights, or citizenship in Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Its primary purpose is to provide a highly secure digital identity for online interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Key Features

The card features very strong 2048-bit digital encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, ensuring that documents digitally signed with it are uniquely verifiable and cannot be faked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The card itself resembles an RFID-enabled card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Included in the E-residency Pack
The e-residency pack contains several components to facilitate the card's use:
*   The e-residency card itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   A rip-off paper containing a PIN code, presumed necessary for card authentication during setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   A sheet detailing the "conditions for use of certificates issued for identity cards, residence permit cards, and digital ID cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   A "black clap black thing" which unfolds into a USB card reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This reader, made by a company called Web Brick Work, is designed to connect to a computer via USB and allow the digital ID card's chip to make contact with internal points for authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Cost
The cost of the e-residency card was 50 euros before February 1st, but has since increased to 100 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## [[Collection process for the eresidency digital ID card | Collection Process for the E-Residency Card]]

The [[process_of_obtaining_an_estonian_eresidency_digital_id_card | process of obtaining an Estonian eresidency digital ID card]] involves picking up the card at a designated embassy or collection point. For one individual, the collection was done at the Estonian Embassy in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Embassy Operating Hours
The London Embassy's hours were noted as:
*   Tuesdays: Open from 1:00 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: Open from 9:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

### Collection Experience
The actual collection experience was described as "super straightforward" and "super easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The wait time for the card's details to be ready for collection was approximately one month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Upon arrival at the embassy, the process was quick, taking less than 5-10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Steps included:
*   Presenting a passport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   Performing a fingerprint scan (both fingers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   Potentially signing something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The process was so efficient that one individual was in and out within ten minutes, being one of only three people present at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

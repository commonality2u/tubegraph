BMSweb is a YouTube channel that features videos showcasing remote control planes and related aerial technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Their content focuses on developing aerial tracking and finding capabilities, along with head-up displays to show the plane's flight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. They also film their operations with a DSLR camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Discovery of the 3D-Printed Rig

The speaker discovered a unique grip for a GoPro camera while watching a BMSweb video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. A child in the video was seen holding this grip with a GoPro attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Upon inquiry, it was found that BMSweb themselves produce these rigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Features of the Rig

The rig's most notable feature is that it is 3D-printed, built up in layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Key design elements include:
*   **Side Grip:** Allows for smooth panning shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Top Handle:** Enables low-down shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **GoPro Compatibility:** The standard GoPro mount can be attached to the bottom of the rig, allowing the camera to clip in and be screwed securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Attachment Points:** It includes small hooks on each side for carrying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

The speaker noted that while the rig itself is compatible with a GoPro, using it with the GoPro frame would be ideal for certain setups, though the frame can be expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Practical Applications

This rig is described as ideal for:
*   Being easily stored and carried in a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   Integrating into B-roll footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Conducting interviews, especially when used with the GoPro frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   Achieving stable, fixed-level shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Ordering and Cost

The rig was shipped from Australia and arrived within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The estimated cost for the rig was approximately $30 or $40, which the speaker considered reasonable given the materials and construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker highly recommends BMSweb for their well-made 3D-printed rig, expressing excitement about the future of 3D printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The rig is compatible with various GoPro models, including the GoPro 3 Black Edition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

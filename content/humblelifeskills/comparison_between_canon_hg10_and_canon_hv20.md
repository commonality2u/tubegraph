This article provides an initial [[comparison_to_other_cameras_and_camcorders | comparison]] between the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | Canon HG10]] and the [[canon_hv20_testing | Canon HV20]], based on a first-impressions [[unboxing_experience_of_canon_hg10 | unboxing]] of the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | HG10]]. The reviewer already owns a [[canon_hv20_testing | Canon HV20]] and uses it as a point of reference for the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | HG10]]'s [[build_quality_and_features_of_canon_hg10 | features]] and design.

## Trial and Community Engagement
The reviewer received the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | Canon HG10]] on a 30-day trial basis through Holly from camerabuzz.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This initiative allows community experts to trial products and provide recommendations directly to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This trial period, coinciding with Christmas, is seen as an "additional Christmas present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The reviewer plans to shoot video, post it online, and engage in video blogging and citizen journalism with the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Key Differences and [[build_quality_and_features_of_canon_hg10 | Features]]

### Storage Medium
A primary distinction is the storage method:
*   **[[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | Canon HG10]]**: A hard drive version with a 40 GB capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, offering extended recording time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **[[canon_hv20_testing | Canon HV20]]**: A tape drive version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | HG10]]'s 40 GB hard drive allows for approximately 15 hours of recording on long play and 11.5 hours on slow play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This extended recording capability is highlighted as ideal for travelers due to the reduced need to offload footage frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The internal drive is noted to be a 2.5-inch form factor, well-integrated into the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Physical Design and Ergonomics
Upon initial impression, the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | HG10]] is perceived as "small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> and "a little bit wider" than the [[canon_hv20_testing | HV20]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The balance of the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | HG10]] is described as "very nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Microphone Placement
One critique specific to the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | HG10]] (and manufacturers in general) is the placement of the internal microphone on the top of the camera, rather than the front, which is seen as an "afterthought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. However, the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | HG10]] does include an external mic input hole on the front, which the reviewer believes might be absent on the [[canon_hv20_testing | HV20]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Battery Compartment
The battery compartment on the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | HG10]] is noted to be similar to the [[canon_hv20_testing | HV20]]'s, which the reviewer "didn't like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It is described as "precarious," lacking a lip to securely hold the battery, making it feel like an "afterthought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The reviewer expresses a preference for a slimmer, more lithium-based battery design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Included Accessories
The [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | HG10]] comes with an HDMI cable, which the reviewer notes as a positive inclusion, suggesting Canon "obviously been listening to people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

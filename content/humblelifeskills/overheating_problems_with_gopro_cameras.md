A significant concern for [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] owners is the device's battery [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | reliability]], which has reportedly limited its usage for some users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Unreliable Battery Performance
The battery that comes with the [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] is considered "incredibly unreliable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Instead of an expected two hours of usage, actual battery life can vary wildly from half an hour to an hour and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. A primary issue is that the battery gets "extremely hot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This overheating can cause the camera to "lock up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Environmental Considerations
There is concern that the [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | GoPro's reliability]] may be compromised in [[gopro_usage_in_various_environments_and_conditions | hotter climates]] or under [[gopro_usage_in_various_environments_and_conditions | hotter usage conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The popularity of GoPro in cold environments like surfing or snowboarding suggests that development may have focused heavily on performance in such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Attempts to Address the Problem

### Aftermarket Batteries
A Wasabi Power [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | GoPro 3 battery]] was found and noted as a potential replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Another Wasabi Power battery was purchased previously, based on the suspicion that the original battery was faulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The specifications for this replacement battery are 3.7 volts, 1200 milliamps, and 4.4 watt-hours, designed to replace the Hero 3 battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The plan is to charge this battery and test the [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | GoPro]] until it runs flat to determine if the issue is indeed a battery fault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### External Power Solutions
An [[alternatives_to_internal_batteries_for_gopro | alternative to internal batteries]] exists in the form of a roughly $60 pack that connects to the [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | GoPro Hero]] and allows it to run on mains power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This [[alternatives_to_internal_batteries_for_gopro | external power source]] eliminates the internal battery's overheating or charging issues by removing the battery from inside the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This approach can improve uptime and prevent the camera from locking up due to heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Planned Use Cases Affected
The [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | GoPro]] is intended for use in a green screen studio setup due to its wide-angle shot capability, which can also be adjusted to medium or narrow views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. However, the camera's [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | unreliable]] and overheating batteries prevent relying on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Attempts to use the [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | GoPro]] with a [[using_gopro_with_blackmagic_intensity_extreme | Blackmagic Intensity Extreme]] as an [[hdmi_output_from_gopro_hero_3 | HDMI input]] also encountered issues, with the camera locking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Seeking Community Input
The user is reaching out to other [[user_experiences_with_gopro_hero_3_plus_batteries | GoPro Hero 3 Plus Edition]] owners to inquire if they have experienced better battery [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | reliability]] or if the problem has been resolved in that model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Additionally, the user is seeking advice from other [[gopro_hero_3_battery_reliability_issues | GoPro 3 Black Edition]] owners who have encountered battery issues and how they were resolved, noting that the camera currently has the latest firmware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

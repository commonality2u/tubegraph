A common need for those with extensive record collections is to convert old 78 RPM records to a digital format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This can be particularly challenging as these records are typically very thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> and require specific equipment not commonly found in modern setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Equipment Used
To address the challenge of [[converting_78_rpm_records_with_usb_turntable | converting 78 RPM records]], a [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] was acquired from Firebox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This type of turntable is designed to work with a PC or Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> and connects directly via a USB cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The [[usb_turntable_features_and_functionality | USB turntable]] purchased costs approximately £120 in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. It is a standard-sized unit, though quite large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. It includes a USB port, a line out, and RCA phono/line inputs, allowing for other audio sources to be fed into it for recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Software and Process
The [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] comes bundled with "Odyssey," a free wave program compatible with both Mac and PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Key steps and features for conversion:
*   **Speed Adjustment**: The [[software_compatibility_with_usb_turntable | software allows for adjusting the speed]] of 78 RPM recordings, which can be reduced by a certain number of seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Audio Preview**: Users can preview the audio coming through the record player to monitor the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Recording Large Collections**: The turntable was acquired to digitize approximately 500 78 RPM records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, indicating its suitability for large-scale projects.

## [[challenges_and_solutions_in_using_usb_turntable | Challenges and Considerations]]
*   **Counterweight**: A critical component for proper playback is the counterweight, which was initially overlooked and nearly discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Without it, the needle lacked sufficient force to stay in the groove, causing skipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Playback Speed**: When playing 33 RPM records, they sounded slightly too slow, requiring manual speed adjustment within the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Determining the optimal setting for tweaking may take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Record Thickness**: 78 RPM records are known to be very thick with more defined grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While the turntable didn't initially come with a specific head for 78 RPMs, it is possible to purchase different play heads for about £15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. A dedicated 78 RPM head, potentially with a thicker needle, is recommended for these records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Overall, the [[setting_up_and_using_a_usb_turntable | USB turntable]] offers a viable solution for [[recording_and_encoding_with_software_encoders | recording]] and converting old 78 RPM records into digital formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

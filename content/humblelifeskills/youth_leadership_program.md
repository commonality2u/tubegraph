The speaker's involvement in a youth leadership program stems from a personal commitment in 2012 to say "yes" to new opportunities, a decision made to ensure that year was different from the last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This commitment led to accepting an invitation to speak about a program with which they had been involved for seven summers, first as a participant and then as a staff member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The "Rising Sun" Program

### Purpose and Vision
The youth leadership program, known as Rising Sun, is run by the Lewis August Jones Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Its stated mission is to create a better world for tomorrow by inspiring young leaders today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The speaker notes that people often struggle to describe the program, leading to a focus on their own interpretation of its successes and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Structure and Participants
Rising Sun operates as an intentional community, similar to co-housing models, where a group of people choose to live together, sharing resources, responsibilities, and actively pursuing a common vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

The program selects bright, motivated young people aged 14 to 16 from various countries around the world, rotating between different nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Participants are housed in New York for two months over the summer, with boys and girls separated to avoid additional complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. During this period, they build a community and undertake a carefully designed program to test its resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Community Development Model
The program aligns with Tuckman's group development model, which outlines four stages communities go through:
*   **Forming** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>: An initial stage where everyone is getting to know each other and playing nicely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Storming** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>: The stage where conflicts arise as individuals get to know each other more deeply without established ways to deal with disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Norming** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>: The community begins to agree on shared values and interaction methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Performing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>: The group becomes a highly functioning unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The speaker found this performing stage particularly exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### A Case Study in Community Resolution
An example of the community's "performing" stage involved 50 teenage girls discussing a suspected theft from a suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Staff expected a focus on punishment, but the girls' four-hour conversation centered on their concern that the incident might threaten their mutual trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Ultimately, they resolved to completely forgive the perpetrator, not discuss it again, and consciously commit to trusting each other more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This mature response allowed the community to move forward stronger, rather than encountering a hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Impact and Successes

### Personal Transformation
The program has had a "massive impact" on the speaker's life, even described as having "ruined" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. At 15, the speaker's clear ambition was to be an astronaut, be "ripped," and own a very big house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Now, they work for an international medical relief charity, feeling "rich in many ways" but knowing their bank account won't sustain a large house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Alumni Contributions
Time and again, Rising Sun alumni have contributed significantly to their local and global communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Recent examples include:
*   A young person who, within months of finishing the program, motivated and fundraised to install solar panels on her school roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   An alumnus who released the worldwide film *Chasing Ice*, which explores glaciers and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Marius, who helped organize a TEDx event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
The speaker believes these achievements stem from their Rising Sun experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. These actions exemplify [[volunteer_work_and_community_involvement]].

## The "How" of the Program

The program's success is not primarily about *what* activities are done (which are typical for a U.S. residential summer program like sport, drama, art, hiking) but *how* they are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Communication: Focus on Deep Connection
A key aspect is fostering deep communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Upon arrival, mobile phones are collected and locked away for two months, forcing participants to focus inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

A core activity is "wisdom circles," where small groups of four or five young people meet weekly to practice speaking from the heart, addressing deep, non-superficial questions like "What are your hopes and fears?" or "How have you experienced culture shock?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. For some, this is their first experience of such deep conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. While connected online, many young people lack the skills for grounded, below-the-surface interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This communication strengthens community bonds and provides a structure for negotiation, conflict resolution, and discussing issues like theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Valuing the Individual and Redefining Fairness
Through intense communal living, participants learn to value each member as an individual, assessing their actions and achievements within their personal context rather than against universal standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This understanding challenges conventional notions of fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. True fairness might mean different contributions from different people or different sized "pieces of the cake" for those with mixed needs and abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. For scholarship recipients from around the world, this lesson — that "to whom much is given, perhaps much is expected" — is particularly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### [[Servant Leadership]]: A Core Principle
The program fosters a unique approach to leadership. While bringing together 60 "precocious teenagers" who all desire to lead might seem problematic, the intense communal living cultivates [[Servant Leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This means leading from within the community, prioritizing the community's needs over one's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Participants learn that leadership isn't about standing at the front or giving orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Leadership is openly discussed, with lessons on concepts, styles, and iconic leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Each day, a different community member takes charge, coached by a staff member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. If the daily leader fails to get up and organize, the entire community might miss breakfast, as staff won't intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This living experience is seen as the true teacher of leadership skills that participants can take home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Tackling Global Issues and Empowering Change
Bringing together individuals from diverse backgrounds, many with personal experiences of conflict and global issues, places tackling such challenges high on the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. While global problems can feel overwhelming to a 15-year-old, surrounding oneself with an inspiring group and working together empowers participants to "step more powerfully into your world" and "affect change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### Lasting Connections and Alumni Network
Participants don't face these challenges alone; they have a network of peers from their summer experience to provide support, inspiration, and collaboration on projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The program perpetuates its methods by bringing back four or five alumni into the next year's program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This creates a common understanding among alumni, allowing for deeper discussions even with those they haven't directly shared an experience with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## [[Rising Sun Program Impact and Limitations]]

> [!CAUTION] Limitations of the Program
> The speaker acknowledges several limitations of the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>:
> *   **Single-gender groups:** Keeping groups single-gender for seven weeks might mean participants never fully relax or that the community's dynamics are not truly tested or sustainable long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. However, it does offer a "taste of what a community could be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
> *   **Risk of Groupthink:** The selection process, which seeks receptive individuals, combined with the "norming" stage of community development, risks leading to uniformity not just in action but in thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. External observers sometimes note that after a few weeks, participants appear to be "all behaving the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Conclusion: Speaker's Challenge

The Rising Sun program has profoundly impacted the speaker's life, and they hope to continue applying its lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Drawing on the program's "council" meetings, where staff impart wisdom, the speaker poses a challenge to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>:

> [!NOTE] Challenge for the Audience
> The speaker challenges listeners to reflect on whether they:
> *   Communicate and listen to their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
> *   Ensure all voices in their immediate community are heard and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
> *   Explore the idea of valuing every individual within a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
> *   Surround themselves with inspiring people to collectively impact their local or global community and "be the change that you want to see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

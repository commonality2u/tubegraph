When making significant changes to your OBS setup, such as [[transitioning_from_43_to_169_layout_in_obs | transitioning from a 4:3 to a 16:9 layout]], it is advisable to duplicate your existing profiles and scene collections first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This ensures that any modifications you make do not affect your original configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Why Duplicate?

Duplicating allows you to experiment with new settings, layouts, and asset adjustments without risking your stable, working setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For instance, when converting a 4:3 profile to a 16:9 profile, duplicating provides a safe environment to make extensive changes to resolutions, intros, outros, and scene layouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## How to Duplicate

The process involves creating copies of both your OBS Profile and your Scene Collection.

### Duplicating an OBS Profile
1.  Go to the "Profile" menu in OBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  Select "Duplicate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
3.  Provide a new name for the duplicated profile (e.g., "16x9") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Duplicating an OBS Scene Collection
1.  Go to the "Scene Collection" menu in OBS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
2.  Select "Duplicate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  Provide a new name for the duplicated scene collection (e.g., "16:9") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

>[!TIP]
> After duplicating, ensure you are working on the new copies by checking the active profile and scene collection names in the respective menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This step is crucial to prevent unintended changes to your original setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

With the duplicated profiles and scene collections, you can then proceed to adjust settings, such as changing the base canvas resolution (e.g., to 1920x1080 for HD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, knowing that your original configurations are preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

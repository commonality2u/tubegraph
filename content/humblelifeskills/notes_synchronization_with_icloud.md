## iCloud Integration with Pages

Notes created using Pages are supported by iCloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This [[compatibility_with_apps_and_devices | iCloud]] integration allows users to easily step through different notes when recording content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The setup includes an iClip microphone standard adapter for [[ipad_adapter_compatibility | iPad one and two]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Teleprompter Functionality

The synchronized notes can be positioned directly up to the lens of a device, enabling their use as a teleprompter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This functionality is described as making things "a lot easier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, the device cannot go into landscape orientation without unscrewing a bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

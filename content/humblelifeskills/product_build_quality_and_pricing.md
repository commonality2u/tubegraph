## Roto Block USB Hub
The Roto block is a USB hub combo device designed as a square block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It addresses a common issue for users of Mac Airs who often have only one USB port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The device is versatile, allowing connection at any angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Its unique feature includes USB ports that rotate outwards, enabling users to set them at different angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This design aims to simplify connecting devices without "faffing around with USB ports" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Additionally, it incorporates an XD card reader supporting various formats such as SD, MMC, T-flash, and MS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Build Quality
While useful, the Roto block USB hub is noted as "not brilliantly built" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Despite this, it is expected to "do the job for a while" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Pricing
The device was acquired from China and costs approximately Â£10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

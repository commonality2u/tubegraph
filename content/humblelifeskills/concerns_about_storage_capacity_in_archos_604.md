Archos released a new device, the AOS 604 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This new model features a massive screen and redesigned controls, which are now located on the right-hand side of the unit, making them more accessible than previous models like the [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. The design also appears skinnier than the previous model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

Despite these improvements and new [[features_of_the_archos_aos_604 | features]], a significant concern has been raised regarding its storage capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Available Storage Options

The Archos 604 is currently available in a 30 Gigabyte (GB) version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. However, a 100 GB version, which is preferred by some users, does not appear to be available at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## User Preference and Purchasing Decision

The absence of a larger storage option directly impacts purchasing decisions. One user stated they would not buy the device unless a 100 GB version is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. The user, who currently owns an [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]] that has been used for about six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, expresses a strong desire for the 100 GB model of the 604, stating they "really want to get that" if it becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Waiting for Larger Capacity
There is some confusion as to why Archos has not released a 100 GB version of the 604 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. As a result, the user intends to wait for the 100 GB version to be released before considering an upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

## Other Capabilities of the Archos 604

Despite the storage concerns, the Archos 604 offers several appealing features:
*   **Native DVD Playback:** It can natively play DVD files (MPEG 2 VOB files) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Codec Support:** The device has the ability to support various codecs, allowing for future compatibility with new formats like OGG through open-source plugin codecs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **H.264 Support:** The 604 supports H.264, indicating a powerful hardware engine for decoding this format, which is increasingly common in video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **[[digital_video_recording_with_the_archos_av500 | DVR Station]]**: While the [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]] can perform DVR functions, the 604 introduces a "beautiful" base unit for its DVR station, with inputs for audio, composite video, and infrared control, enabling recording from sources like Sky or TV directly to MP4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

The upgrade to the Archos 604 is seen as a "step forward," especially with the plugin codecs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. However, the lack of a 100 GB option remains a critical factor for potential buyers.

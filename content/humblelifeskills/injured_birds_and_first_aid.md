When an injured bird is discovered, immediate assessment and care are often necessary, especially for [[stress_in_domesticated_birds | domesticated]] birds or those that have been subject to [[bird_attacks | attacks]] by predators.

## Identifying an Injured Bird
An injured bird may exhibit several signs of distress or physical harm:
*   It might appear "absolutely mutilated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   The bird may be bleeding, indicating active injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Feathers or "tough" might be ripped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   The bird may appear "very scared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> and in pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

A bird might be a pet that has escaped or been attacked while seeking what it perceived as a safe place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Immediate Action and Threats
If an injured bird is found, a crucial first step is to "take him in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> to protect it from further harm. For instance, a crow could "have had him to bits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> if left exposed.

## Risks and Concerns
*   **Trauma**: An injured bird can be highly [[dealing_with_bird_trauma | traumatized]], which is a significant concern as it "could die on us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Stress**: [[stress_in_domesticated_birds | Stress]] deeply affects birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. A bird appearing to sleep might actually be in a critical state due to stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

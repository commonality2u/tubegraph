Living an amazing life might not be what one initially imagines, often diverging from common perceptions of relaxation or luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Instead, it is defined by being in control of one's path and doing what one truly loves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## An Example of an "Amazing Week"

The speaker illustrates this concept by recounting a recent "crazy week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>:
*   **Monday:** Began with a phone call about his wife being involved in a minor car accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Tuesday:** Marked the release of his new book, describing holding it as akin to holding a newborn child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Wednesday:** Publicly announced a new company he had founded, a goal he had set for himself by mentioning it in his book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. He also had to bake five pies for Thanksgiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   **Thursday:** Hosted Thanksgiving for relatives, handling all the cooking himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Friday:** Woke up at 3 AM to catch a flight from JFK to Heathrow, arriving at his hotel at 1 AM the following morning before giving the talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

Despite the hectic schedule, this week was considered "amazing" because the speaker was in control, pursuing what he loved, and was his own boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Core Principles of an Amazing Life

### Doing What You Love
Living an amazing life involves constantly working or thinking about what you do, rather than simply punching a clock from nine to five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This dedication comes from [[pursuing_passion_and_career_fulfillment | pursuing your passion]] and enjoying the work itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. While a traditional nine-to-five job is perfectly acceptable if it's the right fit, slaving away and hating every minute will eventually be corrosive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

### Balancing Work and Personal Life
Crucially, this continuous engagement must be balanced with unplugging and prioritizing family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The speaker emphasizes the support of his family, particularly his wife, as integral to his ability to work hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. It is important to [[balancing_work_and_personal_life | balance work and personal life]] by example for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Doubters and Seizing Opportunities
The path to an amazing life is not easy and will often be met with skepticism, even from close family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. The speaker recalls a time in 2006 when he realized he needed a new job despite having a high-paying, secure position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. A simple email to a friend led to an opportunity to join a new business overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. These opportunities arise when you are working hard and constantly meeting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

### The Concept of "Passion Hits"
The speaker defines "passion hits" as individuals who have successfully turned what they love doing into a livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. This journey is consistently difficult, with daily encounters with doubters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. However, a significant aspect of this path is discovering a supportive community of people who want to see you happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## The Role of Technology

### Enabling Work-Shifting
Technology plays a crucial role in enabling an amazing life by allowing flexibility in work. The speaker has worked from home for six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a> and co-ran a marketing agency with a partner in a different state for two years without meeting face-to-face for the first three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. This highlights the concept of "work shifting," where work can be done from anywhere with an internet connection, including a park bench, improving sanity and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. This contributes to the [[digital_nomad_lifestyle | digital nomad lifestyle]].

### The Importance of Unplugging
While technology is empowering, it's vital to "turn that crap off" and engage with the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. Observing families engrossed in devices, the speaker emphasizes the need to actively seek silence and real-world connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Although social media and technology facilitate connections, true "awesome" moments occur through in-person interactions, such as sharing coffee or beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Giving Back

A crucial component of an amazing life is to [[importance_of_community_and_giving_back | give back]] to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. This extends beyond financial donations to offering one's time, experience, and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.

The speaker's perspective on giving back profoundly changed after a trip to Ghana with the ONE Campaign in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. Despite perceptions of poverty, he observed immense potential, particularly among students at Ashanti University who expressed a desire to stay in Ghana and transform their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. This experience reinforced the human duty to contribute and help others, fostering personal [[search_for_happiness | happiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

> "If you've never done it, whatever you know, volunteer at a soup kitchen, do a coat drive... just make sure you take the time to give back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

Ultimately, an amazing life is achieved through hard work, kindness to others, listening, and helping those around you, leading to truly amazing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

To achieve higher quality [[recording_audio_on_mobile_devices | audio recording on mobile devices]], specifically with an iPhone (such as the iPhone 3G), a specialized [[iphone_to_xlr_cable_solutions | cable solution]] can be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## [[custom_audio_cables_production | Cable Description]]

A [[custom_cables_for_audio_devices | custom cable]] from customcable.com is designed to connect an XLR microphone to an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This cable features a specialized "three-stripe connector" on one end, which is essential for iPhone [[compatibility with XLR microphones | compatibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The cable is internally powered by a 1.5-volt AA battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Connection Process

The correct connection sequence for this [[iphone_to_xlr_cable_solutions | iPhone to XLR cable]] is crucial:
1.  Insert the custom cable's three-stripe connector into the iPhone first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
2.  Then, attach the XLR microphone to the other end of the cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Microphone [[compatibility_with_xlr_microphones | Compatibility]] and Apps

This setup enables the iPhone to record from an XLR microphone, providing better audio quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Compatible Microphones** Not all XLR microphones will work; the system requires either a dynamic or a powered microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. For example, the Rode NTG-2 (referred to as "Fira the Road") is a powered microphone and is compatible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Recording Applications** Compatible applications for recording include "Audio Boo" and "Fira the Road" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

This [[iphone_to_xlr_cable_solutions | solution]] allows for [[broadcast_quality_sound_for_portable_recording | broadcast quality sound on the move]] directly from an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

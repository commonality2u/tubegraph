Archos has introduced a new device, the AOS 604, building upon previous models like the AV500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Both are portable media devices designed for storing and playing video files such as MPEG4s and DX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Design and Ergonomics

The Archos 604 features a "massive screen" and a redesigned control layout compared to the [[archoa_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Archos 604:** All controls are located on the right-hand side of the unit, making them "a lot more accessible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The speaker has been moved from the top to the bottom, allowing for more screen "real estate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The device also appears "skinnier" than the AV500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Archos AV500:** Its buttons are described as "a little bit awkward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The speaker is located on the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The device is considered "quite a thick thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Storage Capacity

[[concerns_about_storage_capacity_in_archoa_604 | Storage capacity]] is a point of concern for the Archos 604.
*   **Archos 604:** It is available in a 30GB version, but a 100GB option has not been seen yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The speaker states they would not purchase the 604 unless a 100GB version is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Archos AV500:** While not explicitly stated, the speaker intends to sell their [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | AV500]] once the 100GB 604 becomes available, implying a potential upgrade in capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Video Playback and Codec Support

Both devices are capable of video playback, but the 604 offers enhanced capabilities.
*   **Archos 604:** This model can natively play DVDs, specifically MPEG2 VOB files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. It supports H.264 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The device is also designed to allow for codec plugins, enabling support for future formats like Ogg, with the potential for open-source codec plugins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Archos AV500:** The AV500 is used for storing and playing MPEG4s and DX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The speaker converts content (e.g., from Fireant) to stream to the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The device is useful for offline viewing when internet is not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Digital Video Recording (DVR)

Both devices have DVR capabilities, but the 604 introduces a dedicated DVR station.
*   **Archos 604:** It features a new DVR station, which is a base unit with multiple inputs including infrared control, audio in (left and right), and composite in (left and right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This allows users to record content directly from sources like Sky or TV to MP4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Archos AV500:** The [[digital_video_recording_with_the_archos_av500 | AV500 can also do DVR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Compatibility and Market Position

Archos devices have historically been "very Centric to Windows and Windows Media Player specifically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The speaker considers Archos to be a better player than the iPod, especially concerning [[comparison_with_other_portable_media_devices | video quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Archos is described as a "little French company" that has built a reputation for producing quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

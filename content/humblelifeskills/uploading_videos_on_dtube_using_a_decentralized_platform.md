DTube is a decentralized application (dApp) that runs on top of the Steam blockchain, also featuring its own blockchain called [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It functions similarly to YouTube but operates on a decentralized platform using [[benefits_and_setup_of_decentralized_video_hosting_with_ipfs | IPFS]] (InterPlanetary File System) for video storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The team behind DTube utilizes an open-source codebase for storing videos, and they manage their own hosting, including a network of servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Managing Your Steam Account Keys with Steam Keychain

For new users to Steam, managing the four keys associated with a Steam account can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

> [!INFO] Steam Keychain
> It is highly recommended to use the Steam Keychain browser extension (available for Chrome and Firefox) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This tool simplifies interactions with the Steam blockchain by storing three of your keys: memo, posting, and owner keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The master key should never be entered into any extension for security reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. With Steam Keychain, you can manage multiple accounts and it will prompt for your master password only when needed, automatically filling in secure login codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## DTube Account and Avalon Blockchain

DTube has its own account system in addition to integrating with Steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. DTube maintains the voting and commenting features of Steam while also utilizing [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon]], their custom-designed blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. An account on [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon]] is necessary for DTube curation eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. DTube launched its own coin, DTC, in May, which can be purchased through their token DTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

This service is particularly beneficial for [[creating_content_for_youtube_and_udemy | YouTube]] creators who have experienced content strikes and are seeking alternative hosting solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Benefits of One Love IPFS:

### Uploading Process with One Love IPFS:
1.  Navigate to `uploader.1tube.tube` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
2.  Click "login" in the top right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
3.  Log in with your username for both Steam and the [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon]] network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
4.  Enter your [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon blockchain]] password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
5.  Click "log in with Steam Connect a Steam keychain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
6.  Once logged in, you'll see an "upload MP4 file" page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
7.  Upload your main video file and consider uploading additional lower-resolution versions (e.g., 480p) using the "advanced" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This provides a better user experience for viewers with slower internet connections, as DTube does not automatically convert video resolutions like [[creating_content_for_youtube_and_udemy | YouTube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
8.  Add a thumbnail, title, description, and tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
9.  Set the [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon]] vote percentage (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
10. Click "upload" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Uploading through One Love IPFS helps pin your content on their enterprise-class service, ensuring better video serving and technical support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Preparing Videos with HandBrake
HandBrake is a free application that allows you to convert video files to different resolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. For example, you can convert a full HD (720p) video to a 480p version for DTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This ensures that users on low internet connections can still watch your content without buffering, as DTube requires manual uploading of different quality versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## DTube's Community Presence

DTube is a significant community on Steemit, often ranking among the top communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The speaker hopes to see more video content on the Steam blockchain, potentially leading to new video-based platforms that integrate textual conversations, possibly leveraging [[integration_of_bittorrent_and_live_streaming_via_dlive | BitTorrent]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

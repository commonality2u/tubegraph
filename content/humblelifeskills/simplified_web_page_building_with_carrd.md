Many social media platforms, such as Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram, limit users to a single link in their bio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This limitation has led to the popularity of "link pages," which serve as a single portal to a collection of other links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This concept is similar to how musicians provide a single link to all their platforms like Deezer and iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Traditional Link Page Services

Initially, many users opted for services like Linktree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. As needs became more complex, users sought more powerful alternatives, such as Beacons.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. However, Beacons.ai faced issues like being blocked on TikTok, requiring a link change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Furthermore, Beacons.ai has a significant pricing structure, costing $10 a month, which amounts to $120 a year just for a basic portal page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

As an alternative to these services, users can leverage existing web apps to [[creating_a_custom_link_page_using_carrd | create a custom link page]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Carrd is presented as a highly [[costeffectiveness_of_using_carrd_for_link_pages | cost-effective solution]] for building simple bio pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Pricing and Value
Carrd offers a very competitive pricing model. A basic setup costs around $9 a year, with a suggested tier of $19 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The $19/year plan allows for the creation of up to 10 sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This means a user can create a professional bio page and nine additional pages for friends or other projects, all while remaining significantly cheaper than platforms like Beacons.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Ease of Use
Building a page with Carrd is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The web builder uses a simple layout, typically consisting of a container with a buttons table inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Users can easily add and change links within this structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The resulting pages look good on mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Carrd also offers a variety of add-on elements for further customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Versatility
Carrd's ability to host multiple sites on a single plan makes it versatile. Users can create different bio pages tailored for specific platforms, such as one for Instagram, one for TikTok, and another for YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This flexibility provides more specific content delivery at a lower cost compared to other dedicated link-page services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Carrd themes are also available via external services like ihas.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

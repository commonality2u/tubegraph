This article details the setup, features, and initial use of a [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]], particularly for [[converting_78_rpm_records_to_digital_format | converting old records]] to digital formats. The featured turntable was purchased from Firebox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Purpose and Overview

A [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] was acquired to convert approximately 500 old, thick 78 RPM records for a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The user previously lacked a record player or a simple method for [[converting_78_rpm_records_to_digital_format | converting records]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The unit is a standard-sized deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, though it is quite large overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Connectivity and [[software_compatibility_with_usb_turntable | Software Compatibility]]

The [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] connects to a PC or Mac via a USB cable located underneath the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It includes Audacity, a free wave program compatible with both Mac and PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. In addition to USB, the turntable features a line out and RCA Phono/Line outputs, allowing for recording from other audio sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Components

The turntable comes with all necessary components, including a USB cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. One crucial component easily overlooked is the [[troubleshooting_common_issues_with_the_usb_turntable | counterweight]] and [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | needle]], which are often tucked away in the packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The belt also needs to be placed on the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### [[troubleshooting_common_issues_with_the_usb_turntable | Troubleshooting Initial Playback Issues]]

During initial testing, the record player skipped frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This issue was resolved by realizing that the [[troubleshooting_common_issues_with_the_usb_turntable | counterweight]] had not been attached, meaning there was insufficient force on the [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | needle]] to keep it in the groove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Usage and [[challenges_and_solutions_in_using_usb_turntable | Playback Considerations]]

The Audacity software allows for a preview of the audio coming through the record player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Playback Speed Adjustments

When playing 33 RPM records, they sounded slightly too slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The software allows for speeding up the audio, but finding the optimal setting requires some adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### [[converting_78_rpm_records_with_usb_turntable | Converting 78 RPM Records]]

For [[converting_78_rpm_records_with_usb_turntable | 78 RPM records]], the software can adjust the playback speed by reducing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Additionally, a specific "78 RPM head" or [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | needle]] is recommended for these records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This is likely because older 78 RPM records are much thicker and have more defined grooves, potentially requiring a thicker [[difference_between_turntable_heads_and_needles | needle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Different heads are available for purchase, costing around £15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Cost

The [[usb_turntable_overview_and_features | USB turntable]] costs approximately £120 in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Additional play heads are about £15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The Archos AV500 is a portable media device chosen for its screen, sound quality, and disc space, and is manufactured by a French company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. It is designed for use away from home, allowing users to easily access media without needing a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Display and Video Quality
The [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | Archos AV500]] features a 16x9 screen format with "really good quality" definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Its picture quality is noted to "completely outstrip" that of competitors like the Zen and iPod video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The device is praised for its immediate availability of a 16x9 screen, even when compared to upcoming competitor models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Storage Capabilities
The [[storage_capabilities_of_the_archos_av500 | Archos AV500]] comes with a 100 GB hard drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This capacity allows for the storage of hundreds of thousands of photos, 10,000 music tracks, and a significant amount of video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. On an empty 100 GB hard drive, it can store 14 hours of direct encoded MP4 video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

The device functions as an external USB 2 drive, similar to a caddy, and can be plugged directly into Windows or Mac computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. It uses a familiar folder-based file system, allowing users to organize content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. File transfers over USB 2 are described as "really, really fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The AV500 also serves as a photo storage device, capable of receiving pictures directly from high-definition cameras (8-9 megapixels, shooting in RAW) via a USB cable, addressing [[highdefinition_video_storage_challenges | challenges with filling up memory cards]] like SD or Compact Flash quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Recording Functionality
A key feature of the [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | Archos AV500]] is its capability as a [[digital_video_recording_with_the_archos_av500 | Digital Video Recorder (DVR)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. It can be plugged into cable boxes (like Sky in the UK or a dig box/cable box in the US) and has a scheduler to record programs directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

An optional accessory, a Sony CCD camera (420 lines), can be plugged into the Archos AV500, offering a headset-mounted video recording solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This camera is an additional cost (approximately Â£40 UK / under $300 US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. When connected, the Archos automatically detects it and provides a video recording option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Battery Life and Availability
The [[archos_av500_features_and_functionality | Archos AV500]] offers approximately 5 hours of battery life on a single charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The 30 GB model was observed selling for around $300-$350 at CompUSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_archos_with_competing_media_players | Comparisons with Competitors]]
The Archos AV500's 100 GB hard drive is noted as significantly larger than current video iPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. While newer, smaller 2.5-inch drives of 120 GB and even 200 GB were emerging in some markets, the Archos AV500's current storage capacity, coupled with its screen quality, provides a strong advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Its screen quality is considered superior to that of the Zen and iPod video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

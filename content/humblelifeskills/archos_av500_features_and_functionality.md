It connects as an external USB 2.0 drive, appearing as a caddy drive on both [[compatibility_of_archos_devices_with_windows | Windows]] and Mac operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Data transfer via USB 2.0 is described as very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Battery Life
The Archos AV500 can last 5 hours on a single charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Advanced Functionality

### Photo Storage and Offloading
The Archos AV500 can serve as a storage device for high-definition camera photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Users can plug in a camera via a USB cable, and the device will directly transfer pictures from the camera to its internal hard drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This is especially useful for quickly filling up SD, Compact Flash, or Micro drives with large raw files (20MB or more) from 8-9 megapixel cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Media Syncing
While lacking a dedicated syncing application, users can set up a program to monitor a specific folder for updates and automatically send content to the Archos AV500 via USB 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### [[digital_video_recording_with_the_archos_av500 | Digital Video Recorder (DVR) Capabilities]]
A standout feature of the Archos AV500 is its built-in DVR functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. It can be plugged directly into cable boxes (like Sky in the UK or other digital boxes) and allows users to schedule and record programs without tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Optional Camera Accessory
An optional accessory is a Sony CCD camera (420 lines), costing about Â£40 UK (just under $300 American dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This camera plugs into the top of the Archos AV500 via two connectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The device automatically detects the camera, adding a new option to the menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. With an empty 100GB hard drive, it can store 14 hours of real-time, direct-encoded MP4 video from this camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_archos_with_competing_media_players | Comparison with Competing Media Players]]
The Archos AV500 is presented as superior to devices like the Zen and iPod Video, particularly concerning screen quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. While newer iPod Video models might feature a touch-sensitive 16x9 format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, the Archos AV500 already provides a high-quality 16x9 screen with excellent definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The speaker suggests that even Steve Jobs might be looking at the Archos AV500 for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, although a 100GB hard drive capacity was not anticipated from competitors, even with the existence of 120GB and emerging 200GB 2.5-inch drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Recommendation
The Archos AV500 is highly recommended, especially for video casters or anyone doing out-of-bounds video casting, such as for mountain biking or sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It is also suitable for creating tutorials and demos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

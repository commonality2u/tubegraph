A Canon product trial program allows individuals to test and provide feedback on new camera models. The program aims to engage community experts who actively use cameras for purposes like [[video_blogging_and_citizen_journalism_with_canon_cameras | video blogging]] and [[video_blogging_and_citizen_journalism_with_canon_cameras | citizen journalism]].

## Canon HG10 Trial

Phil from The Gravity was selected to participate in a 30-day trial of the [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | Canon HG10]], a hard drive version of Canon's latest HD camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. He also owns a [[comparison_between_canon_hg10_and_canon_hv20 | Canon HV20]], which is a tape drive model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Program Initiation
Holly from camerabuzz.com contacted Phil after watching his videos and vlog on dm.blip.tv, and following his new media work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. She invited him to be one of the individuals to trial the Canon camera for 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

> "Which I find absolutely fantastic. I mean it's almost like an additional Christmas present really." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

Phil expressed enthusiasm for the opportunity, noting it allowed him to "play with this over Christmas, shoot some video and post it on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The program aligns with his goal to test and trial new products for [[video_blogging_and_citizen_journalism_with_canon_cameras | video blogging]] and [[video_blogging_and_citizen_journalism_with_canon_cameras | citizen journalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Company Perspective
Phil noted that this trial represents a shift in companies realizing "that they can give products to the community and have people who are experts or know how to use these things, who are actively using them, and give recommendations straight back to the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. He commended Holly for establishing the camerabuzz.com site, which focuses on Canon-related content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Trial Deliverables
During the 30-day trial period, Phil committed to:
*   Posting videos on Vimeo's HD section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   Providing Twitter updates via twitter.com/canonhd10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Bitcoin SV (BSV) offers a platform for building decentralized applications (dApps) that prioritize speed, efficiency, and a new economic model for user interaction. The speaker began exploring BSV platforms in April 2021, seeking out projects with genuine [[utility_of_bitcoin_sv_in_transactions | utility for a token and coin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. While other cryptocurrencies had seen recent drops, the speaker was drawn to BSV for its potential to foster decentralized communities and provide simple, user-friendly applications with excellent UI/UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The underlying strength of BSV lies in its infinitely larger block size compared to Bitcoin, enabling it to handle significantly more transactions per block instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This capability is seen as the "ground zero" for a new wave of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Core Principles of BSV dApps

Many dApps built on BSV aim to mimic the user experience of centralized platforms while offering the benefits of decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. A key differentiator is the integration of [[onboarding_and_retention_strategies_in_bsv_apps | onboarding and retention strategies]] directly into the applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, often through earning opportunities for users.

## Featured BSV Web Applications

### HandCash
HandCash.io is a wallet designed for simplicity and ease of use, reminiscent of "Cash App" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. It facilitates fast and near-instantaneous sending of money due to BSV's large block size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. HandCash also provides an API, allowing developers to build [[bitcoin_sv_web_apps_overview | web apps]] that integrate with its services, enabling users to log in directly from the wallet and perform transactional actions using the BSV blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. A notable feature is "PayMail," which allows users to receive BSV via a simple email-like address (e.g., `humble@handcash.io`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Relica World
Relica.world is described as an Instagram equivalent, providing a simple web interface for adding photos and sharing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. It allows users to track activity and income streams, with small payouts for likes and comments on uploaded pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Relica also features an incentive model where users who invite friends receive 50% of the revenue their referrals earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Twetch
Twetch is a decentralized version of Twitter running on Bitcoin SV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Similar to Relica, it offers onboarding incentives, where referrers receive a cut of the rewards earned by new users they bring onto the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### PewPew (Pay Pistol)
PewPew is an application designed for mass distribution of BSV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. It allows users to send small amounts of BSV to multiple recipients simultaneously, making it ideal for running competitions or giving initial balances to new users who might not have any funds in their HandCash or Money Button wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This tool has significant potential for [[onboarding_and_retention_strategies_in_bsv_apps | onboarding and retention strategies]], particularly for engaging participants in live streams or chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Mitto
Mitto allows users to send Bitcoin SV via email, providing a simple, fast, and private way to onboard new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. By connecting their HandCash wallet, users can email an amount of BSV to complete beginners, immediately giving them a balance and familiarizing them with the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Paytoshi
Paytoshi is a fully-fledged, decentralized exchange for crypto, commodities, stocks, indices, and forex, enabling trading using BSV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Peergame
Peergame is a gaming platform that allows users to connect their wallets using Money Button or HandCash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Its design and speed are highlighted as key features, emphasizing the importance of fast transaction times for user satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Pay Power Cards
Pay Power Cards allows users to purchase gift cards from popular retailers like Amazon, Google Play, Uber, and Spotify using BSV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This provides a way to cash out earned BSV and use it in traditional retail environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### Promotion Marketplace
This platform offers a promotional marketplace where users can earn Bitcoin SV or advertise their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Advertisers can run campaigns, paying small amounts (e.g., 0.01 BSV) for user interactions with links, with payments made instantly upon interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This low-cost model makes it an effective platform for social advertising for apps, communities, or live shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### BritView
BritView is a blockchain-verified review platform where users get paid for every interaction with their reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. It brings a micro-transaction-based economy to online reviews and uses HandCash for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The immutability of blockchain reviews by crypto users is seen as more reliable than paid, centralized platform reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

### Haste Arcade
Haste is highlighted as the world's first ILP arcade and developer SDK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. BSV's fast blockchain is perfect for [[blockchain_applications_in_gaming | gaming]] because it can resolve transactions very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. This allows for instant payouts for in-game bets or wins, without long waiting times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Haste awards HST (Haste) fungible tokens, native to the BSV blockchain, for simply playing games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. A daily issuance of 43,000 HST tokens occurs on a pro-rata basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. The platform also offers a developer SDK with leaderboard management, user authentication, payouts, and a REST API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## User Engagement and Economic Model
The BSV ecosystem fosters a shift in user behavior: while engaging on these platforms might involve a small payment for posting or commenting, users also receive funds for their interactions and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This contrasts with centralized platforms like Instagram or TikTok, where users spend hours without receiving direct rewards for their engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This model ensures platforms can maintain themselves through user activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> and fosters greater ownership over one's content, though some image storage currently relies on Amazon AWS rather than fully decentralized solutions like Sia or Skynet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The speaker believes that BSV's speed, similar to Litecoin and Dash, positions it well for widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The integration of cryptocurrencies into games, especially those with fast completion times, is expected to become more prevalent, leading to increased user onboarding as players seek to earn rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This trend is particularly relevant for industries like esports, where fast, scalable, and reliable integration of crypto payments will be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. The broader goal is to replace centralized services with utility blockchains that can be used on a daily basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

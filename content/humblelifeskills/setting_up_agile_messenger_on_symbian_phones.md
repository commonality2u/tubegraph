[[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Agile Messenger]] is a chat client that can be installed and run on Symbian phones, such as the Nokia N80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It is highlighted as a recommended chat program for mobile devices due to its ability to connect to multiple services simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Installation and Initial Setup

[[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Agile Messenger]] can be accessed through the phone's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Supported Networks
The application supports various instant messaging networks, including:
*   ICQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   AOL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Yahoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

### Internet Access Point Configuration
Users can configure the internet access point. On the Nokia N80, it can be set for home Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Alternatively, it can connect via a mobile data network, such as Orange Internet, which uses 3G and may take longer due to negotiation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Registration Status
On the Nokia N80, the application may display "not registered" even if a registration code is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## User Interface and Features

Upon connection, the main screen displays small icons on the right representing different connected networks, such as Google, MSN, and ICQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Contacts from these networks then populate the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Multi-Network Connectivity**: [[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Agile Messenger]] can connect to more than one chat network simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Integration with Phone Features**: Depending on the version downloaded, the application can utilize phone features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   **Twitter Updates**: Users can send messages to their Twitter feed via the chat client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   **Image Sharing**: An important feature is the ability to send images directly. Users can take a photo with their phone's camera, select a contact, add a message, and send it as a file transfer straight to the recipient's client (e.g., MSN). This is considered a "pretty sweet" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Background Operation**: Once logged in, the service can be hidden and run in the background, consuming minimal data when not actively sending messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This feature helps save on data tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Auto-connect on Start**: An option is available to auto-connect to all chat clients as soon as the phone is turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Full Screen Mode**: A "full screen mode" option is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Accessing the Application
Once installed, [[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Agile Messenger]] appears as a program in the phone's menu, allowing for quick access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## [[compatibility_with_apps_and_devices | Compatibility]] Notes

While [[agile_messenger_overview_on_nokia_n80 | Agile Messenger]] runs well on Symbian 60 (specifically the Nokia N80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, it has been noted to cause issues on devices running Windows Mobile 5, such as the Dash, where it "seems to be working very good on the dash right now so I'm presuming that agile messenger is just suckage on uh on Mobile 5 Windows mobile 5" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Users are advised not to install it on a Dash phone currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

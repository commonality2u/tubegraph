Revolut offers features for exchanging various currencies, including traditional fiat and cryptocurrencies, aiming for real-time rates and ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

## Fiat Currency Exchange

Users can exchange between different fiat currencies, such as GBP, Euro, and Dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The exchange rate is displayed in real-time, and the app shows costs comparable to services like TransferWise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Funds can be added to the Revolut balance, for example, by topping up from a PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Cryptocurrency Exchange

While cryptocurrency activation was initially expected earlier, Revolut experienced [[issues_with_revoluts_cryptocurrency_activation | scaling problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. To gain early access to the cryptocurrency exchange feature, users currently need to either upgrade to Revolut Premium or invite three friends to join Revolut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This strategy might be a way for Revolut to manage their scaling issues and monetize early access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

The platform supports exchange for cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. One of the significant advantages is the ability to swap, change, transfer, and exchange between different currencies as soon as money is added to the balance, making it an easy way to engage with crypto compared to more technical alternative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The real-time exchange rate for cryptocurrencies is also a notable benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Related Features and Usage

Revolut integrates with Apple Pay, allowing users to load funds from other cards and use Revolut for payments, enabling [[tracking_expenses_with_the_revolut_app | expense tracking]] for categories like travel and groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

For online payments, Revolut offers [[using_virtual_cards_for_secure_online_payments | free virtual cards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. These can be used for secure online transactions, especially when traveling, as they can be loaded with a specific amount of money, reducing the risk to a main bank card if compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. While currently free, it is anticipated that there may be a charge for virtual cards in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Ordering a physical card requires topping up the account with at least ten pounds, though a bug was observed where the app did not recognize an existing balance for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

In the evolving landscape of [[social_media_interaction_and_community_engagement | social media]], there's a growing discussion about encouraging public figures to engage more in [[volunteer_work_and_community_involvement | social]] and charitable activities, rather than solely focusing on financial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:26">[02:25:26]</a>.

## Influence and Opportunities for Giving Back

Possessing a large number of followers on platforms like Twitter has become a status symbol, leading charities to approach individuals with significant influence for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:14">[02:38:14]</a>. The speaker, who receives between 15 to 20 emails daily concerning charitable endeavors, believes that there is a strong focus on [[importance_of_community_and_giving_back | giving back]] within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:41">[02:50:41]</a>.

Despite being a "brash promoter" in their business, the speaker prefers to keep their personal charitable activities "under the radar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. They find the act of promoting their own charitable contributions "a little weird," contrasting it with the transparency of promoting a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>. This stance aims to avoid future scrutiny regarding their philanthropic efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:43">[03:33:43]</a>.

> "I think promoting that you're giving to charity is a little weird just for me for other people who works but I don't I do it because I feel like you have to be out there a little bit because otherwise I don't want to get into that pissing war in 24 months of you're crap you're always talking about selling and you don't do any charity and then I have to go and bring out my tax return and humble everybody's face off." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>

## Quality Over Quantity in Social Media

The speaker emphasizes that the number of followers on [[social_media_interaction_and_community_engagement | social media]] "means absolutely nothing" regarding actual influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. A person with 2,000 highly engaged followers who would "jump off bridges for that person" holds more actual sway than someone with 50,000 followers who cannot garner attendance at a simple event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:19">[04:00:19]</a>. This highlights the importance of the quality of engagement, akin to how a small business with 30 dedicated clients can earn more than a retail store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## Streamlining Charitable Outreach

Platforms such as Twitter and Facebook Pages simplify the process of reaching people for charitable causes, making it less time-intensive to communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:19">[04:25:19]</a>. The key is to find a balance, avoiding excessive self-promotion while still providing value to followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:23">[04:36:23]</a>.

### Future Initiatives

A proposal was made to create a "Charity Sunday" hashtag, similar to "Follow Friday," where people could openly discuss and promote their charitable efforts. This idea is based on the belief that Sundays offer a more relaxed environment for people to consider such initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:33">[04:47:33]</a>.

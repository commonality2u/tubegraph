One individual recounts their experience with an [[online_shopping_addiction | online shopping addiction]], specifically related to purchasing t-shirts online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Grip of [[online_shopping_addiction | Online Shopping Addiction]]

Initially, the speaker's buying habits were manageable, involving "normal t-shirts" with a "handle on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. However, the ease of online purchasing, described as "just three clicks," led to an addictive pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The individual became an "addict from buying threadless of the internet," often clicking to order without fully realizing the implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This behavior escalated to buying "10 at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, eventually resulting in an accumulation of 50 shirts, which was recognized as "getting out of hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The sheer volume necessitated buying a new cupboard to store them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Escalating Costs

Beyond the initial purchase price, customs duty became an additional financial burden, costing an "extra 20" to receive the items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Impact on Finances

The severity of the spending habits had a direct and negative impact on the individual's finances, to the point where "some weeks we wouldn't eat" to cover the costs of the purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

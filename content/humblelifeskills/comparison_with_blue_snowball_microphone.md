The MyPort Pro is described as a "work of Genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> and "so much better than other ones that I've used" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, including the Blue Snowball microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Blue Snowball Microphone

The Blue Snowball was considered "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, but it lacked the adjustments present on the MyPort Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Additionally, its blue indicator light was described as "really really blue and not very nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Phil Campbell, known as @philcampbell on Twitter, has identified and demonstrated a simple solution to a common problem experienced by passengers on certain bus services: sliding items on shiny tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This issue, part of the broader [[issues_with_shiny_tables_on_buses | Issues with shiny tables on buses]], can be particularly frustrating after a stressful day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Problem: Shiny Bus Tables

While the [[red_arrow_bus_features | Red Arrow]] bus, a service operated by [[trent_barton_bus_service | Trent Barton]], offers excellent amenities like brilliant Wi-Fi and a convenient five-pound Zigzag ticket for unlimited travel from 9 am <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, its tables present a significant drawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The tables are "far too shiny," causing personal belongings, bags, and bottles to slide around freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Solution: Non-Slip Grip Liner

A practical and inexpensive solution to this problem is the use of a non-slip grip liner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This material, specifically a [[microfiber_mat_as_a_stress_reliever | microfiber mat]], is available for a low cost (around one pound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Application

To implement the solution, a few strips of the non-slip grip liner can be placed on the bus table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Once applied, items placed on these strips will not move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Demonstration of Effectiveness

A side-by-side test was conducted on a bus to demonstrate the effectiveness of the non-slip liner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>:
*   **Shiny Surface:** A bottle placed directly on the shiny table slid and "was gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Fixed Surface (with liner):** The same bottle, when placed on the table with the non-slip liner strips, remained completely stable and did not move, even when the bus was in motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

>This simple, low-cost solution effectively mitigates the issue of items sliding on bus tables, providing a more stable and less stressful travel experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Introduction to DTube and IPFS
DTube is a decentralized application (dApp) that runs on the Steam blockchain, but also has its own blockchain called Avalon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. It functions similarly to YouTube, but operates on a decentralized platform using [[future_potential_of_blockchain_technology_for_decentralized_networks | blockchain technology]] and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>. IPFS is an open-source codebase utilized by the DTube team for video storage, with their own hosting on "color servers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Managing Steam Account Keys with Steam Keychain
For new users to Steam, managing the four account keys can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. It is highly recommended to use the Steam Keychain, available as a Chrome or Firefox extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. This tool simplifies interactions with the Steam blockchain by storing three keys: the memo, posting, and owner keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. The master password should never be entered into an extension or plugin to prevent account compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Steam Keychain allows you to manage multiple accounts and will prompt for your master password when needed, auto-filling login details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## DTube: A Decentralized Video Platform
DTube uses a dual-blockchain approach, integrating with Steam for voting and commenting, while also operating its own blockchain called Avalon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Users have accounts on both networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. DTube is set to launch its own coin, DTC, around May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The Avalon blockchain has been running as a public testnet for over six months, with leaders supporting the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### Uploading via OneLoveIPFS Uploader
1.  Go to the OneLoveIPFS uploader (e.g., `orbloader.1of.tube`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
2.  Click "Login" in the top right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
3.  Enter your username for both Steam and the Avalon network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
4.  Log in with your Avalon blockchain password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
5.  Click "Log in with Steam Connect / Steam Keychain." Steam Keychain can automatically log you in if active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
6.  On the upload page, drag and drop your MP4 file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.
7.  Optionally, use the "Advanced" setting to [[highdefinition_video_storage_challenges | upload user-encoded versions]] of your video in different resolutions (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
    *   This is important because DTube does not automatically convert video resolutions like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
    *   This allows users with slow internet connections or limited cellular data to watch videos more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
    *   Free software like Handbrake can be used to convert full HD videos to lower resolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.
8.  Add a thumbnail, title, description, and tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
9.  Set the Avalon vote percentage and click "Upload" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. The video will be posted to the Steam blockchain with the selected thumbnail, linking to DTube for viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

## DTube's Community Presence
DTube is a significant community on Steam, often ranking as one of the top communities for video posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. The speaker expresses a desire to see more video content on the Steam blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. The integration of [[integration_of_bittorrent_and_live_streaming_via_dlive | BitTorrent technology]] and other advancements are expected to lead to new video-based portals with textual conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

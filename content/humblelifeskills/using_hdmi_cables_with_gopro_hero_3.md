The [[gopro_hero_3_black_edition_features | GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition]] is capable of outputting video via HDMI, a feature many users seek to utilize for external monitoring and capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This capability allows for rediscovering videoblogging due to its incredible picture quality and stable performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## HDMI Port Type and Cables

The [[hdmi_output_from_gopro_hero_3 | HDMI output from the GoPro Hero 3]] is a micro HDMI port located on the side of the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. To connect, a special micro HDMI cable is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The user acquired both a short micro HDMI cable and a chunkier "Cable Matters" brand cable for different uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Cable Management Considerations
When the HDMI cable is plugged in, it hangs off the side, pulling weight to one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. It would be beneficial to have a clip or block system for cable management to prevent the port from getting damaged quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Connecting to External Devices

The goal is to obtain a "clean HDMI out" signal, meaning the video output does not include on-screen display (OSD) elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Attempt with Blackmagic Intensity Extreme
Initially, the user intended to connect the GoPro to an older Mac Pro equipped with a [[using_gopro_with_blackmagic_intensity_extreme | Blackmagic Intensity Extreme]] capture card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This card is designed for full-frame HD capture up to 1080p, offloading processing from the graphics card and CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. However, the Mac Pro machine currently cannot write high-definition videos, so this method was not pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Successful Connection to Lilliput Field Monitor
A successful connection was made using a Lilliput 7-inch LCD field monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This portable monitor features a case that opens out for field use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

To establish the connection:
1.  Plug the micro HDMI cable into the GoPro's side port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
2.  Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to the Lilliput monitor's HDMI input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
3.  Power on the monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
4.  Switch the monitor's mode to camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

The monitor immediately detected an HDMI signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, confirming that [[integrating_gopro_hero_3_with_external_monitors | integrating the GoPro Hero 3 with external monitors]] via HDMI works smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Displayed Information on External Monitor
Upon connection, the monitor displays the camera's live view along with several on-screen feedback elements:
*   "Protune" in the top left corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   Video resolution and frame rate (e.g., "1080 25") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   Battery indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
*   Wi-Fi status (e.g., "Wi-Fi off") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   Camera setup prompts and menu settings, allowing users to navigate camera options directly on the external screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Further investigation is needed to determine if there are settings within the GoPro to turn off these on-screen feedback elements for a clean HDMI out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

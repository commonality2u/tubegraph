Crowdfunding campaigns often utilize incentives and perks to encourage contributions. These can range from tangible rewards to unique experiences, playing a crucial role in engaging potential backers.

## Challenges with Time-Limited Platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
Platforms like Kickstarter are often [[differences_between_timelimited_and_flexible_crowdfunding_platforms | time-limited]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This imposes significant pressure on campaign creators to offer perks and adhere strictly to timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While this model is effective for product launches or projects with clear deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, it can be debilitating for open-ended projects or conceptual ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, making it difficult to maintain the campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Alternative Incentive Models
An alternative approach involves integrating project funding directly into service offerings, fostering [[using_crowdfunding_for_sustainable_cash_flow_and_advocacy_projects | sustainable cash flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a> and deeper engagement.

### Discounted Services
One model proposes offering a discounted rate for services if the payment is directed into a dedicated project fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. For example, a job costing £500 could be offered for £400 if the payment contributes to the project fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Benefits of this Model
*   **Generates Interest:** Saving money prompts clients to inquire about the project they are supporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, creating interest beyond the immediate transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Social Advocacy:** Clients might [[social_media_interaction_and_community_engagement | retweet]] their experience, highlighting their reduced cost and their support for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This provides [[funding_and_sponsorship_for_independent_projects | direct input]] for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Sustainable Funding:** This method helps fund ongoing projects and future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, distinguishing independent practitioners from agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Engagement:** It allows supporters to see where their money went and what has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, providing a direct social layer to the funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This also helps with [[onboarding_and_retention_strategies_in_bsv_apps | customer retention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Examples of Perks

### Land Sponsorship Project
An example of a tangible perk involves a project to acquire land in Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Those who sponsor the land could be invited to a free TEDx event held on the property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

It is important to distinguish between paying a standard fee and making an additional donation for a perk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. While travel expenses would remain the responsibility of the attendee, the experience of being filmed on the land could serve as an attractive incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] GoFundMe for Flexible Campaigns
> For crowdfunding without strict deadlines or complex perk systems, platforms like GoFundMe are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. These platforms allow for more flexibility compared to the time-limited nature of Kickstarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

This article provides an overview of various web applications built on the Bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain, highlighting their features, utility, and the underlying principles of the BSV ecosystem. The apps are discussed as of April 2021.

## Introduction to Bitcoin SV Applications
The speaker began exploring different platforms to understand the utility of a token and coin, particularly after a general crypto market drop in early 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The focus shifted to Bitcoin SV (BSV) due to its environmental considerations and support for [[decentralized_applications_with_bitcoin_sv|decentralized applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The speaker seeks apps that are simple, have excellent UI/UX, and resemble centralized platforms in their ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

A key advantage of Bitcoin SV is its infinitely larger block size compared to Bitcoin, allowing it to handle many more transactions per block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This enables very fast, almost instantaneous transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Wallet Applications
### HandCash.io
HandCash.io is a popular wallet for Bitcoin SV, praised for its design and simple, easy-to-use interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It feels similar to Cash App, making it easy to send money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

> [!INFO] HandCash API
> HandCash offers an API that allows developers to build other web apps on top of its infrastructure, handling the transactional aspects using the [[utility_of_bitcoin_sv_in_transactions | Bitcoin SV blockchain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This enables other dApps (decentralized applications) to log in directly from the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Key Features:
*   **Instant Transactions**: Payments are nearly instantaneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Currency Display**: Balance can be displayed in various currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **PayMail**: Allows users to receive BSV via a simple email-like address (e.g., `yourname@handcash.io`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Transaction Tracking**: Clean interface to track incoming and outgoing payments, including upvotes or comments on other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Money Button
Money Button is another option for sending and receiving BSV, often used interchangeably with HandCash for certain app integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Social & Content Applications
A common characteristic of BSV apps is that most have [[onboarding_and_retention_strategies_in_bsv_apps|onboarding and retention]] mechanisms built-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Relica World (Instagram Equivalent)
Relica World is presented as an Instagram equivalent within the BSV ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Web-based**: Currently operates via a web interface, with no mobile app yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Simplicity**: Very simple to add and share photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Users can track activity and income streams, receiving small payouts for likes and comments on their pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Community**: The speaker appreciates the smaller, less noisy community, which fosters familiarity among users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Referral Rewards**: Users can earn 50% of Relica's revenue whenever friends they invite earn money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Decentralization of Storage
> While the app operates on BSV, its images are currently stored on Amazon AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. True decentralization would involve storage on systems like Sia (Skynet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Twetch (Twitter Equivalent)
Twetch is a decentralized version of Twitter running on Bitcoin SV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Similar to Relica, it offers rewards for [[onboarding_and_retention_strategies_in_bsv_apps|onboarding]] new users, providing a cut of their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Paid Interaction**: Users pay a small amount to post, comment, or like content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This is seen as a cultural shift, where users pay for attention but also receive funds for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Value for Engagement**: Unlike centralized platforms (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) where hours of engagement yield no reward, BSV platforms offer monetary incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### BritView
BritView offers blockchain-verified reviews where users get paid for every interaction with their review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. It integrates a micro-transaction-based economy into online reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **HandCash Integration**: Uses HandCash for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Immutable Reviews**: A review from someone involved in crypto is considered more trustworthy than potentially paid-for reviews on centralized platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Utility & Onboarding Applications
### PewPew (Pay Pistol)
PewPew, also known as Pay Pistol, enables users to send small amounts of BSV to multiple recipients at once, useful for competitions or onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

In 2015, there was a strong focus on [[creating_content_for_youtube_and_udemy | YouTube]] and [[creating_content_for_youtube_and_udemy | Udemy]] content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Content Translation and Transcription Strategy

Insights from [[creating_content_for_youtube_and_udemy | Udemy]] courses highlighted a strategy for repurposing video content:
*   Translating videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   Ripping out the text from videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   Translating the text into English to create blog posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

This process enables content creators to blog as long as they can talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Tools and Implementation
The idea of using services like [[using_cambly_vidmob_and_fiverr_for_income | Fiverr]] for this translation and transcription process was considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

For search engine optimization (SEO), the goal is to create long-form content:
*   Videos should ideally translate into 2,000 words or more of text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   Google favors such extensive posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

The plan involves uploading the [[creating_content_for_youtube_and_udemy | YouTube]] video with the transcribed text underneath it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This strategy was to be extensively implemented over the subsequent couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

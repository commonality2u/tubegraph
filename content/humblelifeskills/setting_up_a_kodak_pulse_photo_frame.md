## Initial Setup and Purpose

A Kodak Pulse photo frame requires initial setup, including [[connecting_photo_frame_to_a_wireless_network | connecting to a wireless network]], as it may display a message indicating the network cannot be found if not configured [00:00:16]-[00:00:21]. Once set up, the frame typically cycles through stored photos, such as those depicting Nottingham [00:00:24]-[00:00:25].

An innovative use for the Kodak Pulse photo frame is to utilize its email reception feature to display pictures sent from Instagram users [00:00:29]-[00:00:34]. This allows the frame to cycle through "snippets" of other people's lives as pictures are delivered directly, eliminating the need to manually browse Instagram [00:00:37]-[00:00:48]. The photo frame can be positioned where photos appear above the viewer [00:00:41]-[00:00:44].

## Sending Photos to the Frame via Email

To send photos from Instagram directly to the Kodak Pulse photo frame, you need to configure Instagram's sharing options.

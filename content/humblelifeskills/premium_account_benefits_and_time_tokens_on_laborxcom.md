LaborX offers a premium account status that provides significant advantages for [[freelancing_and_reputation_system_on_laborxcom | freelancers]] and customers on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:01">[04:47:01]</a>. This status is tied to holding TIME tokens, the native cryptocurrency of the Chrono.tech ecosystem, which includes LaborX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:12">[05:01:12]</a>.

## How to Obtain a Premium Account

To become a premium account owner on LaborX, users need to hold and deposit 150 TIME tokens into their connected wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:12">[05:01:12]</a>. A common method for connecting a wallet is by using MetaMask, a browser plugin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:38">[05:12:38]</a>. Once the TIME tokens are held, the user will receive a badge on their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:12">[06:01:12]</a>.

At the time of recording, 150 TIME tokens were valued at approximately 559 Australian dollars, which converts to about 315 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. The price of Chrono.tech tokens can fluctuate, for instance, being around $275 on UniSwap at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. It's suggested that prices might be lower at certain times, potentially allowing for a cheaper purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Where to Acquire TIME Tokens

TIME tokens can be purchased from several cryptocurrency exchanges:
*   **TimeX Exchange** The platform's own exchange, where new users can sometimes receive a bonus for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   **KuCoin** Offers BTC/USDT and TIME/BTC pairs for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
*   **UniSwap** A decentralized exchange highly favored for its ease of use in crypto transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

    *   Premium account holders are ranked higher in the "browse gigs" list, appearing closer to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

The Power Monkey Explorer is a two-part device designed for solar charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Components

*   **Solar Cell** One part of the device is a solar cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It features a small hook for hanging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A green light on the solar cell indicates when it is picking up sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It can even collect some sunlight on cloudy days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Power Unit** The second part is the main unit where power is stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. By pressing a button, it lights up to show how much power is stored in the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Connectors** The Power Monkey Explorer comes with a variety of different connectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, including one specifically for the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Usage Scenarios

The solar cell can be hung from various locations to capture sunlight:
*   The back of a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   The back of a backpack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   In a window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Outside an airplane window, though it is advised to ask permission before doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

To charge, the solar cell can be placed outside a bag, while the power unit is kept inside the bag to collect the charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This system allows users to charge their devices, such as an iPhone, later in the day when a traditional power socket is not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

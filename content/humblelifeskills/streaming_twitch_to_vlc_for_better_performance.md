This article outlines a method for streaming content from Twitch.tv into [[advantages_of_using_vlc_over_browser_for_streaming | VLC]], an open-source video player, to achieve improved performance with less buffering and lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach allows users to watch the source video quality, often at 60 frames per second, without performance issues commonly experienced in web browsers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Core Tools

The method combines three main components:
*   **VLC Media Player**: A widely used open-source video player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **Streamlink**: A command-line tool that extracts streams from various services and pipes them into a media player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Twitch GUI Program**: A graphical user interface that works with Streamlink and VLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The combination of [[using_streamlink_and_vlc_for_twitch_streaming | Streamlink and VLC]] together provides a robust solution for watching Twitch streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Why Stream Twitch to VLC?

Using VLC for Twitch streaming offers several key advantages over watching directly through a web browser:

*   **Reduced Lag and Buffering**: This method significantly reduces lag and buffering, even when watching high-quality source video streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Tests have shown consistent streaming for six to seven hours without dropouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Lower CPU Usage**: Streaming outside of a browser reduces the load on the CPU, as it avoids browser extensions and other background processes that can cause latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Avoids Flash Player Issues**: Browser-based Flash Player can often cause buffering issues, which are bypassed entirely when using VLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Hardware Acceleration**: VLC leverages hardware acceleration at the core level, contributing to a smoother experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. As an open-source program, VLC has a long-standing reputation for solid performance in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Course Overview

The following areas are covered in a course discussing this streaming method:
*   Using open-source tools to watch the source version of Twitch streams with less lag or buffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   Reasons for watching streams outside of the Twitch website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Screencast demonstration of setting up the Streamlink and Twitch GUI program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Screencast demonstration of using the Twitch GUI program and VLC together to watch a live stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Capturing and editing footage from a GoPro camera using Blackmagic Design hardware and software is a viable option for video production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This setup allows for direct input of the GoPro's raw video feed for further processing and live streaming.

## Connecting GoPro to Blackmagic Intensity Extreme

The [[using_gopro_with_blackmagic_intensity_extreme | Blackmagic Design Intensity Extreme]] is a key component for this integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

*   **Connectivity**: The Intensity Extreme is powered by Thunderbolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and features a standard HDMI IN port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **GoPro HDMI Output**: The [[GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition features | GoPro Hero 3]], like other GoPro models, has a [[hdmi_output_from_gopro_hero_3 | small HDMI out port]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Cabling**: To connect the GoPro to the Intensity Extreme, a [[using_hdmi_cables_with_gopro_hero_3 | small HDMI out cable]] from the GoPro is plugged into the HDMI IN of the Intensity Extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The Intensity Extreme also comes with a breakout cable for various other connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Once connected, the GoPro's output will appear as a source within the Intensity Extreme system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Utilizing Blackmagic Software

Blackmagic Design provides its own capture and editing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **Input Recognition**: The GoPro's feed works perfectly as an input source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Integration with Other Software**: The Blackmagic Intensity Extreme allows the GoPro's input to be recognized in third-party software like Wirecast, where it can be selected as an input source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Post-Capture Adjustments

The raw video feed from the GoPro camera often benefits from post-processing to achieve desired visual quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

*   **Color and Gamma**: Without effects, the footage may appear "raw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It's possible to adjust the [[color_balancing_and_gamma_settings_in_video_capture | color balance and gamma]] settings within the software to improve the look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Scaling and Settings**: Users can utilize settings within the capture or editing software to scale the input and apply other adjustments for an enhanced output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. With proper tinkering, the colors can be corrected to produce a good result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The [[Apogee mic features and usage | Apogee Mic]] is described as a "great little solid device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, known for its audio clarity and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Its audio performance is considered superior to the built-in microphone of the iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Enhancing Audio with iOS Devices

The speaker acquired an [[iPhone compatibility with microphones | iPhone]] 4S with ample storage (10GB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, making it suitable for video blogging, unlike their iPad which had run out of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A specific cable for the older iPhone 4S connector allowed the [[Apogee mic features and usage | Apogee Mic]] to be used, aiming for "better audio quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This setup is seen as a "nice little solution" for recording personal video blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Cable Compatibility Challenges
Initially, the [[Apogee mic features and usage | Apogee Mic]] featured a unique connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. To connect it to an iPad with a Lightning connector, a custom-made cable was imported from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This cable cost approximately Â£40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> and took about a month and a half to arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, predating the widespread availability of Lightning-enabled Apogee mics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Audio Performance and Observations

When testing the [[Apogee mic features and usage | Apogee Mic]] with the camera app on an iOS device, after adjusting the gain, it appeared to function correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The speaker expressed satisfaction, stating, "I like this mic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, noting that "the audio is really clear and nice on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. They explicitly stated it's a "better mic than the actual mic that's in the iPad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Usage for Vlogging
The speaker prefers using the YouTube Capture app for video blogging due to its stabilization feature, clip editing capabilities, and streamlined workflow, allowing quick recording, editing, and tagging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This app supports a "raw straight out of the camera" style of video editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The [[Apogee mic features and usage | Apogee Mic]] was also intended for use with the [[iPhone compatibility with microphones | iPhone]] 4S for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Limitations for Interviews
While suitable for personal vlogs, the [[Apogee mic features and usage | Apogee Mic]] might "probably not that great for doing interviews" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> due to its short length, requiring it to be positioned quite close to the sound source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. However, it could potentially be used on a boom pole with a "fluff thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The Logitech C920 webcam can be used on a Mac for various purposes beyond just Skype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Compatibility and Performance
While the C920 can be used for recording, some users experienced issues with it not recording in [[compatibility_of_logitech_c920_with_imovie | iMovie]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This issue was noted on a machine running OS X Mountain Lion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The camera itself can appear "really fast," though minor audio/video sync issues might occur during recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Camera Features
The C920 performs well in reproducing light and detail, even with limited light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It is also capable of recording audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Key hardware features include hardware encoding and a built-in tripod mount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Recommended Software: Webcam Settings App
For enhanced control over the C920 on a Mac, the `Webcam Settings` app is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This app allows users to access and adjust various camera settings that are not typically available otherwise, especially given the lack of dedicated drivers for Logitech cameras on Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Key Features of the App
*   **Manual Focus**: One of the most significant features is the ability to set manual focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This provides much greater control over image clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Settings**: The app provides access to "all the settings" for studio use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Compatibility**: It allows the C920 to be used with "all your other applications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Price**: The `Webcam Settings` app is available for Â£5.49 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It is notably recognized as one of the first apps for Mac and Android to offer such detailed webcam control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

This app is also compatible with other Logitech cameras, such as the C910 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Other Logitech Cameras
Beyond traditional webcams like the C920, Logitech also offers specialized cameras, such as a new TV camera that features built-in Skype functionality, removing the need for a separate computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

This article details recommended settings for the [[Logitech C920 and C930e camera settings | Logitech C920]] and C930e webcams, along with information on obtaining the necessary software and optimizing lighting. The speaker has also used the [[using_logitech_brio_4k_webcam | Brio 4K]] webcam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, noting that while webcams aren't as good as a DSLR, they "do the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Obtaining the Logitech C920 Webcam Settings Software

It can be challenging to find the [[webcam_settings_app_for_logitech_c920 | C920 software]] for [[webcam_settings_app_for_logitech_c920 | webcam settings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While there is software available on the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, the native Logitech software is more than sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

To download the correct software, navigate to: `support.logi.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
It's noted that the C920 download page can be hard to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, but the software can typically be found under the C930e downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The speaker provides a direct link to the correct version of the [[webcam_settings_app_for_logitech_c920 | software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Lighting Setup

The speaker uses two LED lights positioned about half a meter away from their face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. These lights are set to "daylight mode," which is 5600 Kelvins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This specific [[optimal_lighting_settings_for_webcam_setups | lighting setting]] is important for the camera adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The lights are placed at eye height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Recommended Camera Settings

The following settings are used to achieve a good image:

### Home Page Settings

*   **Images:** Widescreen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Anti-flicker:** PAL 50 hertz (for Europe). In the United States, 60 hertz might be more appropriate due to power and lighting differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **HDR (High Dynamic Range):** On, but it can be turned off if not desired, as it doesn't seem to make a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Field of View:** 78 degrees. While 90 degrees offers a wider shot, 78 degrees provides a closer, preferred view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Advanced Settings

*   **Brightness:** 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Too bright can wash out the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Color Intensity:** 38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Contrast:** 45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Crucial Settings: Auto White Balance and Autofocus

These are the most critical settings for achieving desirable tones:

*   **Auto White Balance:** This should be turned **off** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   If enabled, it can cause drastic and undesirable color changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   The speaker manually sets the [[adjusting_brightness_contrast_and_white_balance_for_webcams | white balance]] as close as possible to 5600 Kelvin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. In the app, it's typically set to 5599 or 5592 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Autofocus:** The webcam's tracking capabilities are not as advanced as a DSLR's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   The speaker uses autofocus initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   They enter the app, click to focus, and then **turn autofocus off** before recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   If frequent movement is expected, keeping autofocus on might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

> [!TIP] Optimizing Color Tones
> These [[manual_focus_and_settings_adjustment_for_webcams | settings]], particularly for [[adjusting_brightness_contrast_and_white_balance_for_webcams | autofocus]] and [[adjusting_brightness_contrast_and_white_balance_for_webcams | auto white balance]], provide the best skin tones for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Users may need to experiment with the color intensity, contrast, and brightness settings to find what works best for their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. It's recommended to review footage on a decent monitor, such as a Retina display, to accurately assess color likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Speaker's Motivation

The speaker created this video to document their [[Logitech C920 and C930e camera settings | camera settings]], as they frequently forget them and have difficulty locating saved files or finding the [[webcam_settings_app_for_logitech_c920 | webcam settings]] online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Related Gear

The speaker also uses a green screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> and a microphone with an arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The microphone is positioned directly in front of the speaker, just below the camera's view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

This article describes a specific USB hub combo device, highlighting its features and practical applications.

## Overview and Design
The device is a square-block-shaped USB hub combo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It is designed to be connected at various angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, including sideways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, allowing flexibility in its placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Key Features

### Addressing USB Limitations
This USB hub is particularly useful for users of [[macbook_air_usb_limitations | mac airs]] who often encounter problems due to having only one USB port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Integrated Card Reader
The device includes an XD card reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> and supports [[multi_card_reader_compatibility | all the formats for card readers]] on all sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, including SD, MMC, T-flash, and MS formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Rotating USB Ports
A notable feature is that the USB ports [[rotating_usb_ports | rotate outwards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, allowing them to be set at different angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This rotation capability aims to prevent difficulties when trying to connect devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Availability and Quality
The USB hub can be acquired for approximately Â£10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While not considered brilliantly built, it is expected to perform its function adequately for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Steam Connect is a secure service designed to facilitate secure logins for [[managing_steem_account_with_steem_keychain | Steem accounts]] and related platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. It functions similarly to Facebook Connect, aiming to reduce the need for multiple logins and passwords across different websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## How it Works

Steam Connect links to the blockchain APIs, enabling users to log in securely to various services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. When using a service like Steam Auto, users first register and then have the option to use their Steam Auto login/password or Steam Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Opting for Steam Connect integrates all [[managing_steem_account_with_steem_keychain | Steem]] account details securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Security and Trust

Steam Connect is considered a safe method for logging in with your [[managing_steem_account_with_steem_keychain | Steem account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. The developer of Steam Auto confirmed that the initial registration form does not capture login details; rather, it's a sign-up process, and Steam Connect is used for the actual secure login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. The implementation of Steam Connect in services like Steam Auto was even suggested by trusted users, such as Crypto Octopus, further validating its reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Importance for Mobile Recording

Custom cables play a crucial role in enabling high-quality audio recording, especially when using mobile devices for video blogging and interviews. The speaker highlights the need for specific connectors to integrate external microphones with devices like the iPhone and iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Using a good external microphone, such as the Apogee Mic, can significantly improve [[audio_engineering_and_live_event_setups | audio quality]] compared to the device's built-in microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This setup provides a "nice little solution" for recording personal video blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. While not ideal for interviews due to cable length, an external mic could be used on a boom pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Specific Cable Examples

The speaker recounts experience with a particular [[custom_audio_cables_production | custom-made cable]] for the Apogee Mic:
*   **Device Compatibility**: The Apogee Mic initially had a "funky different connector on the bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Older iPhone Models**: An older iPhone 4S, with its "older connector," could be used with a specific cable for the Apogee Mic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Lightning Connector Cable**: A custom-made cable featuring a Lightning connector on one end and the Apogee Mic's connector on the other was specially imported from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This was necessary because the Apogee Mic was acquired before it started shipping with Lightning-enabled cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Cost and Delivery**: This specific [[custom_audio_cables_production | custom cable]] cost approximately Â£40 and took about a month and a half to arrive due to being custom-made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: This cable allowed the speaker to use the Apogee Mic with an iPad for better [[audio_engineering and live_event_setups | audio quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions

Using external microphones and mobile devices for recording can present [[challenges_in_audio_technology | challenges]]:
*   **Storage Limitations**: iPads used for video blogging can run out of space, leading to issues with video uploads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Audio Level Issues**: The speaker notes instances where the audio level was too low for viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This requires adjusting microphone gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Optimizing Setup**: Achieving optimal audio often requires precise placement of the microphone, sometimes needing it to be mounted overhead like a boom mic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Future Ideas for Cable Distribution

The speaker muses about a business concept called "Canables" (or "Lightning Canables") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This theoretical company would focus on the [[growth_of_a_custom_cable_business | rapid shipping of cables]], delivering them within a couple of hours to major cities for people with broken cables or charger needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The tagline proposed is "enabling you with cables" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

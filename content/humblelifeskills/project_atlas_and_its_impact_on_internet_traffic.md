Project Atlas is an initiative by [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | Tron]] in collaboration with [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | BitTorrent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Its primary goal is to develop a method for sharing and exchanging files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## BitTorrent's Role and Impact on Traffic

BitTorrent, which forms the basis for Project Atlas, is described as the world's largest decentralized file-sharing protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. It reportedly has 100 million users and accounts for 33% of global internet traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

However, it is noted that a significant portion of this traffic comes from people downloading movies, likely illegally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The 100 million user statistic refers to those who have used BitTorrent technology, not necessarily users of the [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | Tron]]-integrated version of BitTorrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Tokenization and Incentivizing File Sharing

To monetize BitTorrent's usage and incentivize users, [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | Tron]] created a token called BTT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The proposition for this token is to integrate it into the BitTorrent software, allowing for "slow, medium, and fast" lanes of content delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Users would be paid in BTT tokens for seeding content, particularly if they have a fast internet connection (e.g., gigabit) and high uptime, by acting as a node that shares data packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This system would allow content creators to pay for storage and availability, with tokens diminishing as they are distributed to peers providing the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Future Vision and Decentralization

The speaker expresses optimism for Project Atlas, envisioning a future where it is seamlessly integrated into web browsers as a plugin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This would allow users to upload video content to a decentralized cloud, with "miners" (or nodes) being compensated with TRC-10 tokens, similar to Bitcoin royalties for transaction verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

The acquisition of DLive, a live streaming platform, by [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | Tron]] is seen as a strategic move that could further [[integration_of_bittorrent_and_live_streaming_via_dlive | integrate BitTorrent and live streaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This partnership is viewed as a "marriage made in heaven" for handling video storage challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The goal is to create a global peer-to-peer network for video sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. While live streaming might still require centralized nodes for low latency, the vision includes a "chunked" BitTorrent streaming method where all participants contribute to the network and are compensated with tokens for providing peerage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Ultimately, the aspiration is for [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | Tron]] to support other decentralized file systems like IPFS, uniting various technologies to build robust decentralized peer-to-peer networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This [[technological_advancements_and_their_impact | technological advancement]] is expected to accelerate the shift away from centralized platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

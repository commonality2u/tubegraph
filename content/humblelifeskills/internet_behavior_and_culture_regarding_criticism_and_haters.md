Online platforms often showcase a variety of content, some of which may be perceived as "way out" or "lame" by viewers, yet still gain significant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This diversity in content consumption is part of broader [[conversations_about_internet_trends_and_media_consumption | internet trends and media consumption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## The Phenomenon of "Haters"

A common aspect of [[social_media_interaction_and_community_engagement | internet interaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> is the presence of "haters" who "diss" or criticize content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. It is suggested that people who "diss" others online might do so because they are unable to perform the actions themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Motivations for Criticism
The widespread presence of "haters" on the internet raises questions about their motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. It is pondered whether they are simply bored and seeking to "diss" anything they do not possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This critical behavior is seen as unbeneficial and unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Connection to Politeness
The discussion of online "dissing" naturally extends to the topic of [[perspectives_on_politeness_and_social_interactions | politeness in the real world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. While the direct impact of using polite words like "please" and "thank you" is questioned in specific instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, a general principle suggests that kindness and honesty towards others can lead to positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Exuding friendliness is believed to foster more positive interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

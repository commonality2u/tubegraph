Canon's approach to engaging with the new media landscape includes providing trial programs for its cameras to active content creators, fostering a community-driven feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This strategy allows experts and active users to provide direct recommendations back to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## The Canon HG10 Trial Program

Phil, from The Gravity, was given a [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | Canon HG10]] hard drive version to trial for 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This opportunity arose after Holly from Canon Camerabuzz.com noticed his videos and vlogs on dm.blip.tv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The trial period extended over Christmas, allowing for extensive video shooting and online posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Purpose of the Trial
> The primary goal of this [[trial_program_for_canon_products | trial program]] was to test the camera's suitability for video blogging and citizen journalism activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Canon HG10 for Video Blogging & Citizen Journalism

The [[canon_hg10_camcorder_review | Canon HG10]] is highlighted as a suitable tool for mobile content creation due to its features:

### Design and Specifications
*   **Hard Drive Storage** The HG10 is a hard drive version camera, featuring a 40 GB extended recording capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. This allows for approximately 15 hours of recording on long play and 11.5 hours on slow play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   **Portability** Its compact size and balance make it ideal for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Video Quality** The camera records in Full HD 1080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   **Connectivity** It comes with an HDMI cable right in the box, a feature likely included based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. It also features component out and a USB connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
*   **Audio Input** While the built-in microphone is awkwardly placed on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>, the HG10 does include a dedicated hole for an external microphone on the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Lighting** The camera includes front lights, a feature also found on the [[canon_hv20_testing | HV20]], which proved to be very useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   **Battery** The battery compartment design is noted as somewhat precarious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

### Comparison to [[canon_hv20_testing | Canon HV20]]
Phil already owned a [[canon_hv20_testing | Canon HV20]], which is a tape-drive version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. The HG10 shares many similar layouts and features, including the viewfinder, jog dial, function tab, and Mini SD card slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Key differences include the HG10 being slightly wider and having a hard drive instead of tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. The presence of an external mic input on the HG10 is a notable improvement over the HV20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

### Practicality for Traveling
For someone traveling, the HG10's hard drive storage offers significant advantages, as it eliminates the need to constantly offload footage to a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. However, the accumulated data on the internal drive becomes a valuable asset requiring careful handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. The large storage capacity and HD quality make it ideal for documenting experiences while on the go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. This significantly streamlines the [[using_iphone_storage_for_video_blogging | video blogging]] workflow compared to other methods like [[digital_video_recording_with_the_archos_av500 | external hard drive recording]].

## Sharing Content

Videos produced with the HG10 during the trial are uploaded to Vimeo's HD section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a> and a dedicated blip.tv channel, canonhg10.blip.tv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Updates regarding the trial are also shared via Twitter at twitter.com/canonhd10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. The overall [[user_experience_with_canon_hg10 | user experience with the Canon HG10]] for content creation is explored through these platforms.

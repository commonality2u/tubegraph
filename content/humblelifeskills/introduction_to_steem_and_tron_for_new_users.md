This guide is intended for individuals new to Steem, particularly those coming from Tron, or re-evaluating Steem due to [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | Tron news]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It provides a rapid overview of getting started and utilizing key decentralized applications.

## Managing Your Steem Account

When first joining Steem, users will encounter multiple keys required to manage their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. To simplify this process, it is highly recommended to install [[managing_steem_account_with_steem_keychain | Steem Keychain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

*   **Availability**: [[managing_steem_account_with_steem_keychain | Steem Keychain]] is available as a Chrome extension and for Firefox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: It makes managing interactions with the Steem blockchain significantly easier by storing multiple keys, typically the memo, posting, and owner keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The master key should never be entered into any extension or plugin for security reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Usage**: Once installed, you can manage all your Steem accounts through the extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. When an interaction with the Steem blockchain is required, [[managing_steem_account_with_steem_keychain | Steem Keychain]] will prompt for your master password (if set) and automatically fill in the necessary key information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Decentralized Video Hosting with DTube

DTube is a decentralized video platform similar in styling to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It runs on a decentralized platform called IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which is an open-source codebase utilized by the DTube team for video storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

*   **Blockchain Integration**: DTube initially utilized the Steem blockchain for voting and commenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **[[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon Blockchain]]**: DTube also designed and launched its own blockchain called [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Users have an account on [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon]] in addition to their Steem account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Future Developments**: DTube is migrating, and they plan to launch their own coin, DTC, around May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon Blockchain]] is currently a public testnet, meaning tokens earned may be lost during a chain reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. However, posting videos on [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon]] is optional but necessary for DTube curation eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Uploading Videos to DTube

Videos can be uploaded directly via the DTube front-end or using external services.

*   **Direct Upload**: On DTube, users can select an upload server, then drag and drop video files (MP4 format is recommended) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The process then guides you through adding titles, descriptions, and other post details similar to Steem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **One Love IPFS**: This is a separate decentralized file storage service that supports DTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   **Features**: It offers IPFS hosting starting from $3 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, providing 16 GB of data storage on two separate nodes, access to their uploader, 24/7 live support, and access to paid Discord IPFS bots for content posting to DTube and DSound (a SoundCloud for audio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Using One Love IPFS can provide a better serving of video content and technical support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
    *   **Login**: Logging into the One Love IPFS uploader uses your Steem and [[avalon_blockchain_and_its_integration_with_dtube | Avalon]] network credentials, often integrating with [[managing_steem_account_with_steem_keychain | Steem Keychain]] for seamless login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Video Optimization for DTube

Unlike platforms that automatically convert video quality, DTube currently requires users to upload different versions of their video if they wish to offer varied streaming qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

*   **Handbrake**: A free software like Handbrake can be used to convert full HD (720p) videos into lower resolutions like 480p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: Providing multiple versions (e.g., 240p, 480p, 720p, 1080p) helps users on slower internet connections or limited cellular data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. These different versions can then be selected by the viewer directly on the DTube player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## DTube's Presence on Steemit

DTube holds a significant position within Steemit's communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. It is currently the second-largest community on Steemit, and there is an expectation that it will soon become the largest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The community is largely made up of DTube posters who upload videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## Future Outlook

There is a desire to see more video content on the Steem blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. With developments like Sun and [[acquisition_of_bittorrent_by_tron | BitTorrent technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, there's hope for new video-based portals to emerge, potentially incorporating textual conversations alongside videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

The BRCK, also known as "the brick," is a key component of a larger initiative referred to as the Rattler project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>. The BRCK arrived on August 11th, a year and a bit after the initial Kickstarter payment of $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23"></a>. Despite an unexpected Â£30 customs charge, its role in the broader project makes it a significant acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a>.

The BRCK's motto is "If it works in Kenya, it'll work anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08"></a>, reflecting its design in Kenya and assembly in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39"></a>. It aims to provide "rugged internet for people and things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39"></a>.

## BRCK as a Flagstone Piece
The BRCK is considered one of the "flagstone pieces" of the Rattler project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>. Its robustness and features are crucial for this project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35"></a>.

## [[features_of_brck_router | Features of BRCK]]
The BRCK is a mobile router with onboard power and storage, designed to be rugged and cloud-managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54"></a>. Key [[features_of_brck_router | features]] include:
*   Easy setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38"></a>
*   Operates in over 140 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38"></a>

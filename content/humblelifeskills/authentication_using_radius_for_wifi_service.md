It is possible to transmit Wi-Fi signals up to five to ten miles with a good line of sight or a sufficiently high pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. For such a service, authentication can be implemented using a [[using_a_radius_server | radius server]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This allows for setting up a system where users have specific logins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

This kind of Wi-Fi service could be advertised to individuals who need to upload clips or access the internet from devices like phones or PDAs without incurring high mobile data costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Components and Setup Considerations

To set up a broad-range Wi-Fi network that includes authentication, consider the following:
*   **[[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | Wi-Fi Cloud]]**: The overall network structure that extends beyond a single home network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **Placement**: An aerial can be mounted on the side of a building, with wiring managed from the loft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **[[using_a_radius_server | Radius Server]]**: Essential for managing user authentication. Existing 19-inch rack servers can be utilized for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Wi-Fi Aerial**: A flat panel or other suitable aerial can be used to achieve extended transmission range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

For those with Wi-Fi knowledge, assistance may be sought in [[setting_up_a_wifi_cloud | setting up a Wi-Fi cloud]] with authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

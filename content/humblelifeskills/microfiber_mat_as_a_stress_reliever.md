Phil Campbell, traveling on a Red Arrow bus, highlights a significant issue with the onboard tables: their overly shiny surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This shiny surface causes items to slide around, especially problematic after a stressful day when "sweating and my bags and everything else everything's the same as that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The constant movement of belongings on the table contributes to stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The Problem: Unstable Surfaces

The tables on the bus are described as "far too shiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This lack of grip causes items to slide, creating an unstable environment for passengers trying to relax or work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The "shiny surface" is deemed "completely pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Solution: Non-Slip Microfiber Mat

As a practical [[solution_for_nonslip_surface_on_bus_tables | solution for nonslip surface on bus tables]], Campbell proposes using a non-slip ribbed liner, also referred to as a microfiber mat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. He demonstrates that just "a couple of strips of this" material can prevent items from moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This "one pound wonder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> is presented as an effective way to stabilize belongings.

### Demonstration of Effectiveness

To prove its efficacy, Campbell conducts a test using a bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. While the bottle slides on the shiny surface, it remains completely stationary on the microfiber mat, even when the bus is moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This clearly shows the superior grip provided by the mat compared to the original table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Stress Reduction

The primary benefit of integrating this non-slip mat is its ability to "save us the stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. By preventing items from sliding, passengers can avoid the frustration and anxiety associated with unstable surfaces, making their journey more relaxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The suggestion is to have the mat "stitching into the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> for a permanent fix.

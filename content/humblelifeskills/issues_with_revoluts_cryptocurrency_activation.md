Revolut's cryptocurrency activation faced initial delays and subsequent access restrictions for users. The expected activation date was missed, with Revolut citing scaling problems on their Twitter [00:00:14].

## Delayed Activation and Access Restrictions

Originally, cryptocurrency features were anticipated to be widely available [00:00:11]. However, at the time of this recording, direct access to [[revolut_app_features_for_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency exchange]] was not immediately available to all users. Instead, a prompt appeared stating that [[revolut_app_features_for_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency]] would be available soon, offering options to unlock early access [00:01:36].

To gain early access, users were required to either:
*   Upgrade to Revolut Premium [00:01:44].
*   Invite three friends to sign up for Revolut [00:01:48].

The speaker interpreted this strategy as a "super smart power move" by Revolut [00:02:00]. This approach likely stemmed from their acknowledged scaling issues, allowing them to manage demand and potentially monetize early access to the [[revolut_app_features_for_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency]] feature [00:02:04].

## Other App Observations

Beyond [[revolut_app_features_for_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency]] access, the speaker noted other functional aspects and potential bugs within the Revolut app:

*   **Topping Up Funds** Funds could be added, with the speaker successfully topping up ten pounds via PayPal [00:00:21].
*   **Currency Exchange** The app displays real-time exchange rates for [[exchanging_currencies_with_revolut | exchanging currencies]] like GBP to EUR, including TransferWise costs [00:01:04]. The real-time nature of the exchange rate was highlighted as a significant benefit [00:02:37].
*   **Physical Card Ordering Bug** Despite having sufficient balance, the app requested another Â£10 top-up to order a physical Revolut card, indicating a potential bug where it wasn't detecting the existing balance [00:03:16].
*   **Virtual Cards** The app allows users to create free virtual cards for online payments, which are activated after identity verification [00:05:11]. These virtual cards offer a security benefit, particularly for travelers, as they can be loaded with specific amounts, limiting risk if card details are compromised [00:06:16].
*   **Expense Tracking** The app also includes a feature for [[tracking_expenses_with_the_revolut_app | tracking expenses]] by categorizing spending (e.g., travel, groceries) [00:04:10].
*   **Crypto Spending Integration (Anticipated)** The speaker expressed a desire for a "one-stop shop" where [[revolut_app_features_for_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrencies]] could be sent to Revolut, enabling spending via Apple Pay [00:04:39]. At the time, the app only supported Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Ether [00:04:49].

Protecting mobile hardware, especially when [[using_technology_during_travel | on the go]], is crucial to prevent damage to devices [00:00:00]. Considering mobile devices are not cheap, having extra protection is very useful [00:04:13].

## Types of Protective Cases

Various cases are available to safeguard different mobile devices:

### Griffin Survivor Case for iPad 2
The Griffin Survivor case for the [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPad 2]] is described as a "fantastic case" [00:00:20].

*   **Design and Features:**
    *   It's a "wrap" with an integrated kickstand that allows the iPad to stand up or lean at an angle [00:00:27].
    *   The case splits apart, featuring a plastic membrane that fits all ports, making them dustproof [00:01:04]. It is also considered splash-proof, though not fully waterproof [00:01:11].
    *   Inside, the [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPad 2]] sits within a plastic cage [00:01:16].
    *   The top case has a transparent plastic sheet that protects the screen, allowing touch functionality [00:01:41]. This sheet can become mucky and should be cleaned regularly [00:01:48].
    *   It features an audio slit at the bottom [00:02:35].
    *   All ports, including the charging port, audio port, and camera, are covered [00:03:22]. The camera cover can be inconvenient for video or photo shooting, sometimes requiring it to be held open [00:03:28]. For users not concerned about dust, cutting off the camera cover might be considered [00:03:40].
    *   The case clicks into place to secure the device [00:02:48].
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Provides a "hardcore" level of security for the device [00:03:09].
    *   Offers significant protection, helping the device withstand drops and slips [00:04:09].
    *   The user purchased this extreme case after their [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPad 2]] screen was smashed within a week of purchase at South by Southwest Eco [00:02:20].
*   **Limitations:**
    *   The case significantly increases the size of the [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPad 2]] [00:01:19], which might defeat the purpose for those who prefer the device's super-slim original design [00:01:31].
    *   For [[limitations_of_using_protective_cases_for_gaming | gaming]], this case is not ideal as it reduces screen sensitivity [00:02:01]. This was tested with Grand Theft Auto 3, where input for actions like accelerating or steering was not great [00:02:09].

### Tank Case for iPhone 4
An [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPhone 4]] was protected by a "tank case" [00:04:22].

*   **Features:**
    *   It has a sliding screen cover that moves back and forth [00:04:30].
    *   This screen cover scrambles the display, making it difficult to read [00:04:40], which is useful for maintaining privacy when conducting sensitive communications or leaving the phone unattended [00:04:46].
    *   The case is simple to remove via buttons at the bottom and back [00:05:01], allowing the [[protective_cases_for_ipad_2_and_iphone_4 | iPhone 4]] to be used with accessories like a glyph or tripod [00:05:21].
    *   It's a "really strong plastic case" [00:05:51].
    *   The front screen folds into itself, providing additional protection [00:05:58].

### Super Tough Case for Cards
A "super tough case," costing about $10, was purchased for storing loyalty cards and business cards [00:06:04].

*   **Benefits:**
    *   Extremely durable; it can be driven over [00:06:08].
    *   Protects cards from breaking or getting scratched up, which is vital for individuals who rely heavily on these cards for daily activities or business check-ins [00:06:21].
    *   It is waterproof, preventing business cards from looking "grubby" [00:06:35].

In summary, protecting mobile devices and important items is crucial for durability, privacy, and maintaining their condition while mobile [00:06:41].

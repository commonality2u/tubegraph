The [[elgato_turbo_264_hd_functionality | Elgato Turbo 264 HD]] is a hardware USB stick designed for faster video encoding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is priced around 80-90 pounds in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, and approximately 80-90 bucks in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

It primarily accelerates H.264 video encoding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. H.264 is the common codec and format used for most web video compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## [[elgato_turbo_264_hd_functionality | Functionality and Setup]]

Setting up the Elgato Turbo 264 HD takes approximately two to three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The process involves installing software from a CD, entering serial codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, and connecting the USB stick using the included USB extender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The device is especially useful for [[optimizing_video_settings_and_performance_for_older_computers | older computers]], such as a five or six-year-old Mac Pro, where the older CPUs can take a long time to encode [[hd_video_quality | high definition video]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The Elgato Turbo 264 HD offloads the encoding task to its internal chip, preventing the computer's CPU from being slowed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

When the Elgato unit is actively encoding, a red light illuminates on the USB device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Integration with iMovie and QuickTime

The Elgato Turbo 264 HD integrates with iMovie '11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. To export video using the device, users can right-click in iMovie and select "Export using [[using_quicktime_with_elgato_turbo_264_hd | QuickTime]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:02:04]</a>. The Elgato Turbo 264 HD will appear as an option in the export drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. This method yields good quality video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Encoding Features

The device offers several preset settings for common devices and platforms:
*   iPod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>
*   iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>
*   Apple TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:19">[02:19:19]</a>

It can also encode to [[hd_video_quality | HD]] in both 720p and 1080p resolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>.

Users can create their own custom settings to tweak audio and video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>.

### [[exporting_and_uploading_videos_with_elgato_turbo_264_hd | Exporting and Uploading]]

A useful feature is the ability to encode and directly upload video to a YouTube account or an FTP account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:26">[02:26:26]</a>. This is beneficial for quick uploads after finishing an edit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>. For FTP uploads, users can insert their account details and specify the destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:58">[02:58:58]</a>. This functionality is particularly useful for uploading to an FTP service that then encodes and distributes the video to other cloud services like Blip TV, Wistia, or YouTube simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.

## Benefits and Performance Improvements

The Elgato Turbo 264 HD can significantly [[improving_video_encoding_speed_on_older_macs | improve video encoding speed]], potentially making it four times faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:57">[03:57:57]</a>. This is especially advantageous for individuals using older laptops (e.g., five years old) who frequently encode [[hd_video_quality | high definition video]] while mobile, such as from devices like the Kodak Play Touch or Canon XS200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:42">[03:42:42]</a>.

A key benefit is that the device handles the video encoding job internally with its small chip, preventing the computer's main CPUs from being utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:04">[04:04:04]</a>. This means the computer is not slowed down during the encoding process, allowing users to perform other tasks simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:10">[04:10:10]</a>.

Integrating Trello with Slack allows teams to stay updated on project progress without leaving the communication platform. This integration centralizes information and can significantly enhance team productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## [[installing_trello_integration_for_slack | Installing the Trello Integration for Slack]]

The process of [[installing_trello_integration_for_slack | installing the Trello integration for Slack]] is straightforward and begins within Slack's app directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

1.  **Browse Apps**: Navigate to the "Browse Apps" function within Slack's app directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  **Find Trello**: Locate and select "Trello" from the available applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
3.  **Configure Settings**: Step through the various settings presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
4.  **Authenticate**: Authenticate your Trello account via a pop-up box, which allows the integration to connect to your Trello boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
5.  **Select Board**: Choose the specific Trello board from which you want information to be pulled into Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

After selecting the Trello board, you can configure the types of notifications you wish to receive in Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These include updates for:

*   New boards and lists being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Cards within a board or list being updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Checklists being created or marked as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>

For example, when a new card like "test member" is added to a Trello board, a notification appears in the designated Slack channel (e.g., "working Trello"), stating "new card test member added to members" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Similarly, if a member is archived in Trello, an update is sent to Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The integration is incredibly useful for [[improving_productivity_with_trelloslack_integration | improving productivity]] and streamlining team collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

*   **Reduced Distraction**: It eliminates the need to leave Slack, preventing distractions from emails, browser tabs, or social media like Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This helps avoid the "distraction economy" of constantly jumping between different applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Real-time Updates**: Team members can receive immediate notifications about project developments, even if they are working in a different Slack channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. An updated Slack channel (e.g., "working Trello" becoming bolded) indicates new messages are waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Team Dialogue**: The integration fosters dialogue among team members by providing visibility into who is working on what asset, its progress, any updates, and assigned tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This allows for assigning jobs to others and tracking job completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Reduced Email Spam**: It significantly cuts down on internal email traffic related to project updates, as all relevant information is centralized in Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

By keeping all project-related communication in one central location, the Trello-Slack integration boosts overall team productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

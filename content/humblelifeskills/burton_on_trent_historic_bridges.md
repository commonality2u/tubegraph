Burton on Trent features several notable bridges, including historic structures, affected by the frequent [[flooding_in_burton_on_trent | flooding]] of the River Trent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The "New Bridge"
One structure observed is referred to as the "new bridge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Fge Bridge
An "18th century Bridge" is mentioned and identified as "the fge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The video shows this bridge nearly submerged due to high water levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Historical Marker
An inscription from the 1880s or 1889 notes "the gift of Michael Baron of the bur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, visible in the area experiencing [[flooding_in_burton_on_trent | flooding]].

## Impact of Flooding
The area around these bridges is often referred to as "the washlands" because it "just gets flooded all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The River Trent is described as breaking its banks significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, resulting in total inundation of gardens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> and pathways that are normally walkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The water levels can become very high and flow rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

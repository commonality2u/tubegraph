The company "yourcustomcable.com", based in the Netherlands, specializes in [[custom_audio_cables_production | custom audio cable production]] and provides solutions for various audio needs, ranging from individual musicians to large-scale concert setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52">[08:52]</a>. The business began online two years prior to the discussion and later established its own website due to initial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17">[01:17]</a>.

## Company Origins and Growth
The owner, Yes for SLO, has a background in [[challenges_in_audio_technology | audio tech]], having worked for rock concerts and similar events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a>. The company started small and is projected to grow rapidly in the coming two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48">[04:48]</a>. The owner's wife will be involved in administration and web design, and the company is actively seeking qualified personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55">[04:55]</a>.

## Custom Cable Production
The core strength of the company lies in its ability to produce [[custom_audio_cables_production | custom cables]] of any desired length, even specific measurements like 27 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34">[06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03">[09:03]</a>. This contrasts with other companies that typically offer cables only in standard lengths (e.g., 1m, 3m, 5m) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20">[07:20]</a>. The company reuses any leftover cable pieces, making the custom cutting process efficient and cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34">[07:34]</a>.

Small, simple cable connections can be assembled relatively quickly, taking approximately 5 to 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15">[03:15]</a>. Discounts are available when purchasing more cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36">[03:36]</a>. Most cables produced are for guitarists and specialized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>.

## Large-Scale Concert Systems
Beyond individual [[custom_cables_for_audio_devices | audio devices]], the company also constructs large systems for major concerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05">[04:05]</a>. These "thick cables" run from the stage to the mixing console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12">[04:12]</a>. Building and designing such a system can take around three weeks, especially when catering to unique client requirements which may extend the assembly and planning time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>.

## Troubleshooting and Technical Solutions
The company also addresses technical challenges related to [[broadcast_quality_sound_for_portable_recording | portable recording]] setups. One common issue discussed involves connecting a Rode microphone to an iPhone, which can cause music to start playing when unplugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46">[10:46]</a>. This phenomenon occurs because the iPhone's headset includes volume and skip buttons, and when the headset is unplugged, a residual current on the plug can trigger music playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48">[11:48]</a>. The recommended solution is to unplug the microphone from the Rode first, and then disconnect the four-pin connector from the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16">[12:16]</a>.

Another challenge involves creating a very small cable with a jack for headphones on a device where the plug is too small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11">[13:11]</a>. The company is experimenting with this to determine if an audio signal can be passed through for monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32">[13:32]</a>. A simple test involves using the iPhone's internal microphone with headsets plugged in; if you can hear yourself, it indicates that the audio is passing through the four-pin connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48">[14:48]</a>.

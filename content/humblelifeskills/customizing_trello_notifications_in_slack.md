Integrating Trello with Slack allows users to receive real-time updates from their Trello boards directly within Slack channels, enhancing [[improving_productivity_with_trelloslack_integration | productivity]] and team collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This integration minimizes distractions by centralizing project notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Installation and Setup

To begin, you can find the Trello integration in [[using_slacks_app_directory_to_integrate_trello | Slack's App Directory]] using the "Browse Apps" function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The [[installing_trello_integration_for_slack | installation process]] involves stepping through various settings and authenticating with Trello via a pop-up requester <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. After authentication, you select the specific Trello board from which you want to receive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Types of Notifications

Once integrated, you can receive a variety of notifications directly in your Slack channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. These include updates for:
*   Every time a board or list is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Any time cards on the linked board or list are updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   When checklists are created or ticked off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

For instance, if a new card like "test member" is added to a Trello board, a notification "new card test member added to members" immediately appears in the designated Slack channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Similarly, archiving a member on Trello will generate a corresponding notification in Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. If you are in a different Slack channel, the channel receiving the Trello update will be highlighted (bolded with white text), indicating a new message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Benefits for Teams

The Trello-Slack integration offers significant [[benefits_of_trelloslack_integration_for_team_collaboration | benefits for team collaboration]] and workflow efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>:

*   **Reduced Distraction:** It eliminates the need to leave Slack, check emails, or browse Trello directly, preventing the "distraction economy" of jumping between tabs and applications like Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Team members can stay informed about project progress, assigned tasks, and completed jobs without constant communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Improved Dialogue:** It creates a clear dialogue among team members by providing visibility into who is working on what, the status of assets, and any updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Reduced Email Clutter:** The integration significantly cuts down on internal email spam related to project updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Centralized Productivity:** By having all relevant project notifications in one central location, overall [[improving_productivity_with_trelloslack_integration | productivity]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

Investing in [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]], also known as pre-IPO shares, involves acquiring ownership in a company before it is listed on a public stock exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. While these shares are not publicly traded, they are very much in existence and are held by the company's promoters, family members, employees, or strategic partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.

## Why Invest in Unlisted Shares?

## Risks and Considerations

Investing in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] carries specific [[investment_risks_in_unlisted_shares | risks and challenges]]:
*   **Capital Loss**: If the unlisted company performs poorly or goes bankrupt, the entire invested capital can be at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: It can sometimes be difficult to buy or sell [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] due to lower liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Some platforms, however, assist investors in liquidating holdings within a short timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **IPO Delays**: Delays in the company's IPO can lead to a drop in the unlisted share's value, as seen with OYO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Dilution**: The value and ownership of existing shareholders can reduce if more shares are issued (e.g., via ESOPs, rights issues, preferential allotment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.
*   **Fraud**: The gray market is not regulated by SEBI, increasing the risk of scams, manipulations, sale of fake shares, inflated prices, or misrepresentation of financials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. [[online_platforms_for_trading_unlisted_shares | Online platforms]] aim to mitigate these risks through transparency and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

## [[taxation_on_unlisted_shares | Taxation on Unlisted Shares]]

When selling [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]], taxation depends on the holding period:
*   **Short-Term Capital Gain (STCG)**: If shares are sold within 24 months of purchase, the gains are taxed according to the investor's income tax slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG)**: If shares are sold after 24 months, long-term capital gain tax is applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Recent budget changes have set the LTCG tax at 12.5%, compared to an earlier 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. This change is expected to further boost the [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. It is advisable to consult a tax advisor for specific guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

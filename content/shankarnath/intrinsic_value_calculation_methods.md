Calculating the intrinsic value of a share is a crucial step in understanding a company's true worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This process helps investors avoid paying too much for a stock and identify undervalued opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, it's important to remember that determining intrinsic value is an estimation of the future, not a 100% accurate answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Before diving into quantitative analysis, it is imperative for an investor to thoroughly understand a company's current condition and growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Qualitative inquiries about the business should be addressed first; if a company doesn't meet initial qualitative criteria, moving to the quantitative part might be unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. As Warren Buffett stated, "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than to buy a fair company at a wonderful price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Three different methods can be used to calculate a share's true worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

## 1. Relative Value Model

The [[relative_valuation_and_price_earning_multiples | Relative Value Model]] assesses a business's worth by comparing its financials with those of its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Key Metrics
*   **Price-Earning (P/E) Multiple**: A popular metric, effective for companies and industries with relatively stable earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   *Example*: For large IT services companies, the median P/E ratio is around 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Wipro, with a P/E of 19, suggests potential upside compared to others like L&T Technology, which trades at 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. An investor might hypothesize that Wipro (at 417 rupees/share with a 19.7 P/E) could reach Infosys's P/E of 24, estimating a future price of 508 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Price to Book (P/B) Ratio**: Useful for comparing capital-intensive industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Price to Free Cash Flow**: HCLTech, for instance, might appear undervalued using this metric compared to its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Historical P/E Ratio**: Analyzing a company's historical P/E ratio can reveal relative value over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **52-Week High/Low**: Comparing the current price to its 52-week high or low levels can also indicate relative value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Limitations
This method may not work well in cyclical industries or during highly volatile market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It also becomes less relevant for diversified portfolios (e.g., comparing Reliance Industries with an IOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Additionally, it can overlook crucial qualitative factors like sales and profit growth, competitive advantages, and management quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method

The [[discounted_cash_flow_method | Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method]] determines the [[intrinsic_value_of_infosys_stock | intrinsic value of Infosys stock]] based on the total cash a business is expected to generate in the future, discounted back to its present value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

<div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">
        <div class="callout-icon"></div>
        <div class="callout-title-inner">Warren Buffett on Intrinsic Value</div>
    </div>
    <div class="callout-content">
        <p>"Intrinsic value is what is the number that if you were all knowing about the future and could predict all the cash that a business would give you between now and judgment day discounted at the proper discount rate. That number is what the intrinsic value of business is." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a></p>
    </div>
</div>

The core idea is to estimate how much cash the business will generate in the future and what those future cash flows are worth in today's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Here are the five steps for a DCF exercise, using Infosys as an example:

### Step 1: Understand Owner's Earnings
Owner's earnings represent the amount of money a business makes for its owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Formula**: Operating Cash Flow (OCF) - Maintenance Capital Expenditure (Maintenance Capex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   Operating Cash Flow is cash generated by business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. For Infosys in FY23, this was over 31,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   Maintenance Capex is the necessary expenditure to continue operations and sustain growth (e.g., property, laptops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. It's often harder to find in financial statements, but can be estimated from expenditure rows in the cash flow statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   *Infosys Example*: OCF (31,261 crores) - Maintenance Capex (2,579 crores) = Owner's Earnings of 28,682 crores for FY23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Note**: The formula for owner's earnings is not a fixed rule; different investors, including Warren Buffett, may tweak it based on their understanding of financial statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If maintenance capex is unavailable, total capex (which includes both maintenance and growth spending) can be used, defining what is often called [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | free cash flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Some companies may report free cash flow directly in their annual reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Step 2: Project Future Cash Flows
This involves imagining the business's future over a reasonable period, like 10 years for a large company such as Infosys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Part 1: Owner's Earnings Buildup**: Estimate the growth of owner's earnings. For Infosys, a 7% initial growth tapering down to 5% could be assumed, leading to earnings growing from 28,000 crores to around 50,000 crores in 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Part 2: Terminal Value**: Assume the entire business is sold in the final projection year (e.g., the 10th year) and calculate a large payout called the terminal value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This is similar to the [[relative_valuation_and_price_earning_multiples | relative value model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Historically, Infosys's market cap to owner's earnings ratio averaged 20. Conservatively, using a multiple of 16 for the 10th year's owner's earnings (50,867 crores) gives a terminal value of 8 lakh 13,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Sensitivity to Assumptions**: DCF modeling is tricky due to its reliance on assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Small changes in growth rates or terminal value multiples can significantly alter the total projected cash flows (e.g., an 8% growth and a terminal multiple of 22 could increase the sum by 47%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Honesty in projections and a clear understanding of the company's goals, metrics, and milestones are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Step 3: Discount Cash Flows to Present Value
This step brings the future cash flows back to their worth today, accounting for the time value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Concept**: Just as money grows with interest in a fixed deposit, future cash flows need to be "discounted" to find their equivalent value today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Process**: Each future year's projected cash flow is divided by (1 + discount rate) raised to the power of the number of years in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Infosys's projected FY24 cash flow (30,690 crores), realized one year from now, discounted at 8% (30,690 / 1.08) gives its present value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Cash flows further in the future are discounted more heavily (e.g., FY25 cash flow / (1.08)^2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Discount Rate**: This is a critical number. A higher discount rate leads to a lower present value of future cash flows and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
    *   **Ways to Determine**:
        *   **Cost of Capital Approach**: Reflects the average rate of return a company pays to its debtors and equity shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
        *   **Hurdle Rate Approach**: Sets the discount rate based on the target or minimum rate of return a business must achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
        *   **Market Data Approach**: Looks at discount rates of comparable projects or companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
        *   **Intuition**: Many practitioners use their experience and knowledge to determine an ideal discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
    *   The discount rate represents the minimum percentage return an investor would accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. A common choice is 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Applying a 12% discount rate to Infosys's estimated future cash flows yields a present value sum of 4 lakh 80,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Step 4: Add Cash and Liquid Investments
The total present value of discounted cash flows should be augmented by any cash and liquid investments held by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   *Infosys Example*: Infosys has cash equivalents of over 12,000 crores and liquid investments (mutual funds, government securities, etc.) of over 19,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. These are added to the discounted present value (4.8 lakh crores), resulting in an intrinsic value of 5 lakh 12,145 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Step 5: Calculate Intrinsic Value Per Share
Divide the total intrinsic value by the number of shares outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   *Infosys Example*: 5 lakh 12,145 crores / 420 crore shares = 1,221 rupees per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Margin of Safety
After calculating the intrinsic value, it is crucial to apply a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Since DCF relies on assumptions and estimations, a layer of protection is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   An additional discount (e.g., 30%) can be applied to the calculated intrinsic value to determine a conservative buy price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   *Infosys Example*: With an intrinsic value of 1,221 rupees/share, applying a 30% discount suggests a buy price of 854 rupees/share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This buffer accounts for potential inaccuracies in projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | This principle is paramount in any valuation exercise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

At the time of this video's recording, Infosys shares were trading at 1,424 rupees, indicating it was approximately 16% overvalued based on the calculated intrinsic value of 1,221 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## 3. Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

The [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | Dividend Discount Model]] is a framework based on expected future dividends to determine a company's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. It requires three inputs:
1.  **Current Dividend Per Share (Numerator)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
2.  **Discount Rate (Denominator)**: Similar to the DCF method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
3.  **Dividend Growth Rate (Subtracted from Discount Rate)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

*   **Formula**: Current Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Dividend Growth Rate)
*   *Infosys Example*: For FY23, Infosys paid a dividend of 32.50 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Using a 12% discount rate and assuming an 8% dividend growth rate (aligned with profit growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>:
    32.50 / (0.12 - 0.08) = 32.50 / 0.04 = 812 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   According to the DDM, Infosys's intrinsic value would be 812 rupees, making it appear extremely overpriced compared to its market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

### Limitations
The DDM is generally not favored by some investors and is not a feasible strategy for growth stocks that pay little or no dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## Conclusion
While all three methods — Relative Value, Discounted Cash Flow, and Dividend Discount Model — involve estimations and assumptions, they provide an investor with a valuable starting point to understand a business's potential value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

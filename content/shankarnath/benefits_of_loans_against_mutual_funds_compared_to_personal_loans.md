When faced with a need for immediate funds, especially when the market has crashed and assets like [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | equities mutual funds]] and stocks are cheaper, it's problematic to redeem investments at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While personal loans or maxing out credit cards are options, they are typically very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A third, more advantageous option is a [[loans_against_mutual_funds_eligibility_and_application_process | loan against mutual funds]] (LAMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Advantages of Loans Against Mutual Funds

[[loans_against_mutual_funds_eligibility_and_application_process | Loans against mutual funds]] offer several key benefits that make them a superior alternative to traditional personal loans:

*   **No Liquidation Required**
    Unlike redeeming your [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] at a loss, LAMF does not require you to liquidate your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Your [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual fund]] units act as security for the loan, held by the bank or NBFC until repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Interest on Used Amount Only**
    Interest is charged only on the money you actually withdraw and use, not on the entire sanctioned [[how_to_calculate_loan_eligibility_using_mutual_funds | credit limit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This contrasts sharply with a personal loan, where you pay [[interest_rates_and_fees_associated_with_loans_against_mutual_funds | interest]] on the full amount disbursed, even if you only need a portion of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Lower Interest Rates**
    The [[interest_rates_and_fees_associated_with_loans_against_mutual_funds | interest rate]] on LAMF is significantly lower than that of personal loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. For instance, platforms like yeno offer [[interest_rates_and_fees_associated_with_loans_against_mutual_funds | interest rates]] around 10.5% per annum, much lower than typical personal loan charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Generally, these loans are in the 10-13% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   **Retention of Dividends and Returns**
    You continue to retain any dividends received and benefit from capital appreciation on your pledged [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This allows your investments to keep growing while you access liquidity.
*   **Flexible Payment Terms**
    LAMF typically comes with no foreclosure charges or prepayment [[interest_rates_and_fees_associated_with_loans_against_mutual_funds | fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This flexibility allows you to repay the loan as soon as you have funds available, reducing the overall [[interest_rates_and_fees_associated_with_loans_against_mutual_funds | interest]] burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Overdraft/Credit Limit Facility**
    Instead of a lump sum transfer, lenders often provide an overdraft limit through a current account or a [[how_to_calculate_loan_eligibility_using_mutual_funds | credit limit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This is highly beneficial for managing fluctuating cash flows, as exemplified by self-employed individuals who can draw small amounts and repay them quickly as invoices are cleared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Application Process**
    Many institutions and [[digital_platforms_for_managing_loans_against_mutual_funds | digital platforms]] have streamlined the application process, making it entirely digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This means eligibility checks, KYC, pledging units, and disbursement can be done swiftly, sometimes in less than 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## How Loans Against Mutual Funds Work

The process of availing a [[loans_against_mutual_funds_eligibility_and_application_process | loan against mutual funds]] typically involves three steps:
1.  **Estimating [[how_to_calculate_loan_eligibility_using_mutual_funds | Loan Eligibility]]**: This is a function of your [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual fund]] corpus and the type of scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   For [[debt_mutual_funds_and_safety_considerations | debt funds]], lenders may offer up to 80% of the Net Asset Value (NAV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
    *   For [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | equity mutual funds]], the limit is around 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
2.  **Pledging MF Units**: Your [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual fund]] units are pledged in favor of the loan provider, who then sets up a lien over these units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **Disbursement of Loan**: The loan is disbursed as a [[how_to_calculate_loan_eligibility_using_mutual_funds | credit limit]] or overdraft facility in your account, which you can draw upon as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Eligibility and Application

Any individual over 18 years with money invested in [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] can apply for a [[loans_against_mutual_funds_eligibility_and_application_process | loan against mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While individuals are typically allowed for [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | equity mutual funds]], [[debt_mutual_funds_and_safety_considerations | debt funds]] are more flexible, accepting units from partnerships, Hindu undivided families, sole proprietors, and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Many institutions, including popular banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI, Bank of Baroda) and large NBFCs (Bajaj Finance, Tata Capital), offer this product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. However, many have a limited list of approved [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual fund]] schemes against which loans are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Safety of Your Mutual Funds

A common concern is the safety of pledged [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]]. [[loans_against_mutual_funds_eligibility_and_application_process | Loans against mutual funds]] are regulated by the RBI, with strict compliance rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Platforms like yeno do not directly hold your pledged [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Instead, your holdings remain with the registrars (CAMS and KFintech), where a lien is marked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite their significant advantages, [[loans_against_mutual_funds_eligibility_and_application_process | loans against mutual funds]] have not reached the broader retail market, which still heavily relies on more expensive personal loans and credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. However, with the emergence of [[digital_platforms_for_managing_loans_against_mutual_funds | digital platforms]] like yeno, accessing these low-interest, flexible loans has become much more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. This makes LAMF a valuable financial tool for managing temporary money requirements without liquidating long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

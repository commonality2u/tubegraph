The [[understanding_the_piotroski_score | Piotroski Score]], or F-score, is a scoring mechanism developed by Joseph Piotrosky in 2000 to assess a company's strength and [[piotroski_score_and_financial_health_indicators | financial health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. While the original methodology showed promising returns of over 20% ROI in backtesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, its effectiveness can vary when applied to different market environments.

## The Original Piotroski Score and Its Foundation

The original [[understanding_the_piotroski_score | Piotroski Score]] is calculated based on nine financial criteria, categorized into three areas:
1.  **Profitability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>: Includes net income, return on assets (RoA), operating cash flow, and accruals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This category carries four out of the nine available points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
2.  **Leverage, Liquidity, and Source of Funds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>: Examines long-term debt to total assets, current ratio, and share issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Issuing new shares is considered a negative factor, indicating potential financial instability or inability to generate sufficient funds internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
3.  **Operating Efficiency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>: Focuses on gross margin and asset turnover ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The score ranges from 0 to 9, with 7, 8, or 9 indicating a financially strong company, and 0, 1, or 2 suggesting financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Importantly, the original nine parameters are purely based on company financials and are not directly market-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Application in the Indian Environment

An exploration into how the [[understanding_the_piotroski_score | Piotroski Score]] performs in the Indian market involved examining the Nifty 200 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This analysis revealed:
*   Only four companies among the Nifty 200 achieved a top score of nine: Coal India, Varun Beverages, PI Industries, and Oil India Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   Approximately 35% of Indian companies across different market capitalizations demonstrated an F-score of 7, 8, or 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Backtesting and Performance

To evaluate the effectiveness of the [[understanding_the_piotroski_score | Piotroski Score]] in India, [[backtesting_and_evaluating_piotroski_score_effectiveness | backtesting]] was performed on a list of 28 companies from a July 2021 Aditya Birla Capital presentation, all having a Piotroski score of at least seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Over the subsequent two years, the returns from this portfolio were comparable to those delivered by the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This suggested that, by itself, the original scoring system might be missing crucial elements for outperformance in the Indian context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Limitations: The Role of Valuations

A significant limitation identified was the absence of [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The price at which a fundamentally strong company is bought or sold was not factored into the original score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Modified Piotroski Score for Enhanced Performance

To address the limitations and potentially achieve higher returns, a [[modified_piotroski_score_incorporating_market_factors | modified Piotroski score]] was proposed based on research from BITS Pilani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This modified approach made several key changes:
*   **Removed Variables**: Return on Assets (RoA) and Operating Cash Flow were removed from the original list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Added Market-Driven Metrics**: Four new variables were introduced to identify undervalued companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>:
    *   Price-to-Earnings (PE) multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>
    *   Price-to-Book (PB) value ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>
    *   Enterprise Value (EV) upon EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>
    *   Incremental changes in the firm's Free Cash Flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>
*   **Technical Indicators**: Two technical indicators were included to gauge market trends and strength:
    *   Moving Average Crossover (to identify uptrends) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>
    *   Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) (to gauge trend strength) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>

The [[backtesting_and_evaluating_piotroski_score_effectiveness | backtesting]] of this [[modified_piotroski_score_incorporating_market_factors | modified 13-variable approach]] showed a significant jump in annualized returns and the Sharp Ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, suggesting that incorporating market factors alongside fundamental financial health indicators can lead to better investment outcomes.

## Conclusion

The [[understanding_the_piotroski_score | Piotroski Score]] offers a systematic method to evaluate company strength based on [[piotroski_score_and_financial_health_indicators | financial health indicators]] like profitability, leverage, liquidity, and operating efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. However, its effectiveness, particularly in dynamic markets like India, can be enhanced by integrating market-driven valuation metrics and technical indicators. While the original score provides a valuable foundation, it is not foolproof, as scores can change significantly year-to-year due to the dynamic nature of financial numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. A comprehensive approach that combines fundamental strength with market [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | valuations]] and trend analysis may improve the chances of identifying promising investment opportunities.

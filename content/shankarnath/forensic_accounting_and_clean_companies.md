Marulus Investment Managers, an asset management firm founded in 2018, places a strong emphasis on [[Analysis of financial statements | forensic accounting]] as a core part of its investment strategy for identifying "clean companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Importance of Clean Companies
Marulus's research indicates that companies adhering to accurate accounting practices tend to perform significantly better in terms of wealth creation for their shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This focus on "clean companies" stems from a recognition that many Indian companies have questionable ethics and governance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

In fact, Marulus suggests that if a thousand Indian companies were subjected to a "governance washing machine," only about 20 to 25 companies would emerge "clean and dry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. These particular companies have historically outperformed the Indian stock market by 10% year-on-year for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Therefore, Marulus assigns significant weight to investing in companies with clean practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, and prioritizes businesses that operate in a clean and ethical manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## Forensic Accounting Process
Forensic accounting is the initial layer in the construction of Marulus's portfolios, including the Consistent Compounders Portfolio (CCP), Rising Giants, and Little Champs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The firm screens the entire universe of eligible companies using various accounting ratios to pinpoint those with clean accounting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Key Metrics and Factors
Marulus examines a dozen accounting ratios and qualitative factors, including:
*   **Operating cash flow to operating profits ratio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
*   **Contingent liabilities as a percentage of net worth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>
*   **Capital work in progress to gross block ratio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>
*   **Composition of the board of directors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
*   **Related party transactions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>

These assessments help the team understand a company's "moral fiber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
A significant portion, approximately 40%, of the initial set of companies are filtered out at this forensic accounting stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Much of Marulus's approach to forensic accounting is influenced by principles found in the book "Financial Shenanigans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

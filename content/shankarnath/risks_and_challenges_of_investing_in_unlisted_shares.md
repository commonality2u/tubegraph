Investing in [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction|unlisted shares]], also known as pre-IPO shares, comes with a specific set of [[investment_risks_in_unlisted_shares|risks and challenges]] that potential investors should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Lack of Regulation and Transparency
The gray market, where [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market|pre-IPO shares]] are bought and sold, is not regulated by SEBI (the Securities and Exchange Board of India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This lack of regulation leads to a lack of transparency and inherently higher risk for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Even without outright fraud, there is a general lack of transparency in this market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Key Risks

### Capital Loss
If an [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market|unlisted company]] fails to perform or goes bankrupt, investors face the risk of losing their entire capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Liquidity Issues
It can be challenging to buy or sell [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market|unlisted shares]] at times due to a lack of liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. However, some platforms like Precise aim to help investors liquidate their holdings within a 24 to 48-hour timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### IPO Delays
If a company's IPO is delayed for any reason, the price of its [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market|unlisted shares]] may drop in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. An example is OYO (Ora Stays Limited), whose share price declined by 50% from 76 rupees in mid-February to 38 rupees by early June after it withdrew its draft prospectus in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Dilution
The issuance of new shares through ESOPs, rights issues, or preferential allotments can lead to dilution, reducing the value and ownership percentage of existing shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Fraud
The "fraud element" is a significant risk, which can manifest as scams and manipulations by brokers and promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Common examples of fraud include:
*   Sale of fake or duplicate shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
*   Inflating stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>
*   Misrepresenting a company's financials or prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>

## Taxation Considerations
Understanding the [[taxation_on_unlisted_shares|taxation on unlisted shares]] is crucial, and it's advisable to consult a tax advisor or chartered accountant due to changing tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Holding Period
The holding period to determine capital gains tax is 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG)**: Applicable if an [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market|unlisted share]] is sold after 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Recently, the tax rate for LTCG on [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market|unlisted shares]] has been changed to 12.5% from the earlier 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This change is expected to further grow the [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market|unlisted shares]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Capital Gain (STCG)**: Applicable if an [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market|unlisted share]] is sold within 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The tax on STCG is computed according to the investor's slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges
While historical challenges in procuring [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market|shares]] offline existed, technological advancements have led to online platforms that offer improved price transparency and operational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. These platforms aim to address issues like lack of transparency by providing detailed research, maintaining low ticket sizes, and streamlining the [[process_of_buying_unlisted_shares|workflow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

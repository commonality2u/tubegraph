Dr. Vijay Malik, a full-time equity investor and teacher, developed a comprehensive checklist for selecting stocks, detailed in his article "Final Checklist for Buying Stocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This checklist is broken down into four major categories: [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metrics]], [[business_operations_metrics_in_stock_analysis | business parameters]], [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuation-related numbers]], and company management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The fourth and final category focuses on [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Key [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | Valuation Metrics]]

Dr. Malik's checklist includes six different [[stock screening platforms and financial metrics | metrics]] to consider when assessing a company's [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is a highly popular metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. It can be analyzed on a historical basis, comparing the current P/E to its past values, and on a comparative basis, matching the company's P/E ratio against its industry or sector P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### PEG Ratio
The PEG ratio indicates whether a company is over or undervalued.
*   If the PEG ratio is above one, the company is considered overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   If it is below one, there is an indication of undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Earnings Yield
The earnings yield should ideally be higher than the yield on a 10-year Government of India Bond; otherwise, investing in an equity instrument would not make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. At the time of video recording, the 10-year paper yield was 7.17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The earnings yield is the inverse of the P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

### Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
Dr. Malik prefers companies where the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Price-to-Sales Ratio
Drawing a reference from James O'Shaughnessy, Dr. Malik's checklist suggests:
*   Invest in a stock if the price-to-sales ratio is less than 1.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   Promptly sell that stock if the number goes above three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Dividend Yield
While a dividend yield of five percent is highly desirable, Dr. Malik advises investors not to focus too much on this number if the company is growing at a fast pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Flexibility in [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | Valuation]] Parameters

According to Dr. Malik, among the four categories (financial, business, management, and [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuations]]), the [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuation]] parameter can be relaxed a bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The first three categories help identify a fundamentally strong company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Therefore, even if the [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuation]] (price) becomes a bit expensive, it primarily means that return expectations might need to be toned down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This checklist serves as a good starting point for identifying stocks using a standard [[stock screening platforms and financial metrics | screener]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

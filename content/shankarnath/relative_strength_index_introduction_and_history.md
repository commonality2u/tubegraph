The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical analysis tool designed to help investors make informed decisions by understanding market sentiment and price momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Often referred to as the "secret keepers of Market sentiment," the RSI provides signals about potential buying or selling opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Origins of RSI

The concept of the Relative Strength Index was introduced in 1978 by J. Welles Wilder, an American mechanical engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Wilder presented RSI as a momentum oscillator, a tool that measures the velocity and magnitude of price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## What RSI Measures

The primary purpose of the RSI is to provide investors with a signal indicating when a stock is [[using_rsi_to_identify_overbought_and_oversold_stocks | overbought]] or [[using_rsi_to_identify_overbought_and_oversold_stocks | oversold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

*   **Range and Interpretation**: The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   An RSI above 70 indicates that a stock is considered [[using_rsi_to_identify_overbought_and_oversold_stocks | overbought]], suggesting a potential selling opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   An RSI below 30 signals an [[using_rsi_to_identify_overbought_and_oversold_stocks | oversold]] situation, which can be interpreted as a buying signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Trend Reversal**: This technical indicator can also identify stocks that may be ready for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **"Relative Strength" Explained**: The term "relative strength" refers to the fact that the indicator assesses a stock's strength or weakness based solely on its own performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It does not compare one stock to another or to the overall market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Lagging Indicator**: RSI is a lagging indicator, meaning it uses historical data (typically the past 14 days, as originally used by Wilder) to generate potential buy or sell signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. While 14 days is the most common period, some practitioners adjust this to 9-day or 25-day windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

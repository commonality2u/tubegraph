When a promoter increases their stake in a company, it often signals that they perceive the company as more valuable than its current market price, making it a promising indicator for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This article, drawing heavily from a talk by Mr. Maran Govindaswami of UniFi Capital titled "Indian promoters are the best contrarians," explores this event as an [[investment_strategies_based_on_tracking_promoter_activities | investing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Promoter Ownership in India vs. Western Markets

[[comparing_promoterdriven_ownership_in_india_versus_western_markets | Western markets]], such as the US, Europe, Canada, and Australia, typically feature a clear separation between ownership and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. In these regions, institutions like hedge funds, pension funds, and insurance companies usually hold a significant portion of shares, while professional managers are tasked with running the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

In India ("Bharat"), the owner and manager are often the same person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Among the top 500 companies, which represent 94-95% of the total market cap, about 70-75% have a CEO or managing director who is either the promoter or appointed by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Promoters hold the largest share of ownership by market capitalization, fluctuating between 45% and 55% over the last 10-15 years, with an average of about 50% across companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This high level of promoter ownership suggests that monitoring changes in their stake can provide valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Methods Promoters Use to Increase Their Stake

There are typically five main ways for promoters to increase their stake in a company:

### 1. Open Market Buying
Promoters can purchase shares directly from the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. However, they must adhere to regulatory norms, including the Takeover Act and insider trading regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### 2. Preferential Issue
A preferential issue allows a company to issue shares to a select group of investors, including promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This method can also be a very fast way to raise capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 3. Warrants
Warrants grant promoters the right to buy a specified number of shares at a predetermined price within a set timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. If the current share price exceeds the exercise price, promoters will typically exercise their warrants, thereby increasing their stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### 4. Rights Issue
A rights issue offers existing shareholders, including promoters, the right to purchase additional shares, usually at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Promoters can increase their holding by participating in a rights issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### 5. Buybacks
Unlike other methods that require promoters to commit additional money, a buyback offers an easy way for promoters to increase their shareholding by *not* participating in the buyback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. When a company buys back its own shares, the total number of outstanding shares decreases, increasing the proportional stake of those who did not sell their shares, such as promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Promoter Behavior and Market Valuation

Promoters are often shrewd businesspersons who understand the importance of valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. They tend to buy when market odds are in their favor and may dilute their stake when numbers are against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

An inverse [[correlation_between_promoter_buying_and_company_performance | correlation]] exists between promoter buying activity and market valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>:
*   **Buying during Low Valuations**: During periods when the midcap index was cheap, such as 2009 and the COVID months (April-December 2020), promoters significantly increased their stake in over 100 companies by at least half a percent within a quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Staying Away During High Valuations**: Conversely, when the midcap index saw a massive run-up in 2016-2017, promoters refrained from making additional stock purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. They generally avoid buying when there are very high mutual fund collections, record FII inflows, strong stock market returns, increased retail investor participation, and numerous IPOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Dilution during High Valuations**: Some promoters even cleverly dilute their stake by taking advantage of high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. For example, in April-June of the previous year, when mid and small-cap markets reached all-time highs, promoters of over 100 companies sold shares worth more than 16,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This includes promoters of HDFC AMC, Vedant Fashions, Coforge, TD Power, and MTAR Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

This pattern suggests that promoters often act as contrarian investors, with a decent idea of when valuations are too low or too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This phenomenon is also observed on a sectoral basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. For instance, in 2018-2019, when the FMCG sector traded at high P/E multiples (50-70), there was virtually no buying activity from promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. In contrast, sectors like Auto, Pharma, and Metals, which performed poorly during the same period, saw significant insider buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Investment Strategy Based on Promoter Actions

Tracking promoter activity can be a valuable [[investment_strategies_based_on_tracking_promoter_activities | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. UniFi Capital, for example, has an "Insider Shadow strategy" that focuses on building a portfolio of multicap companies where promoters are gradually increasing their stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Other firms, like Nepean Capital, also actively monitor promoter buying, terming it "smart money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

A study tracking companies where promoter shareholding increased over 15 years showed that in about 73% of cases, investor returns were substantial, potentially 20-30% higher than the Nifty 500 Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Furthermore, companies where promoters increase their shareholding often exhibit strong financial characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. More than half (56%) of such companies had zero debt or a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

While this strategy offers a better sense of timing (promoters buy when odds are favorable) and indicates strong financial health (promoters commit money when the company is in good shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, it's not a firm rule. There are cases where stock prices continue to decline or remain stagnant for years even after promoters increase their stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Therefore, it's suggested to approach this as a portfolio strategy rather than picking individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

To implement this, one could:
1.  Extract a list of companies where promoter holding has increased (e.g., by 1%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
2.  Conduct financial checks (P/E ratio, ROC, sales growth, free cash flow) to narrow the list to about 30 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
3.  Examine each company individually to identify those with the highest chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
4.  Finally, select 10-12 companies for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

By shadowing promoters, who have proven to be smart contrarian investors, investors can potentially achieve excess profits over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

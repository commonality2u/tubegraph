The Piotroski Score, sometimes called Piotroski's F-Score, is a crucial mechanism used to assess a company's strength and [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>. It functions like a report card for a company's financial standing, scoring it on a scale from zero to nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.

It was developed by Joseph Piotroski, who first introduced it in a paper in the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>. The formula itself is straightforward and gained prominence when Piotroski achieved over 20% Return on Investment (ROI) by [[backtesting_and_evaluating_piotroski_score_effectiveness | backtesting]] data and investing in stocks based on his system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

## Understanding the Piotroski Score
The Piotroski Score assigns points based on nine different criteria, with one point awarded for each criterion met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:58">[01:58:58]</a>.

A high score, typically 7, 8, or 9, signifies a company performing well financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. Conversely, scores of 0, 1, or 2 indicate a struggling company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>. [[understanding_the_piotroski_score | Understanding the F-score]] is considered an important tool in an investor's toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>.

The nine factors of Piotroski's F-Score are categorized into three major areas:
1.  Profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>
2.  Leverage, Liquidity, and Source of Funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>
3.  Operating Efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>

### 1. Profitability (Maximum 4 points)
This category carries the highest weightage, offering up to four points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:31">[02:31:31]</a>.

*   **Net Income:** A company earns one point if it has a positive net income (i.e., it made a profit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>. For example, Coal India, by making a profit, gets one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:13">[03:13:13]</a>. This simple criterion alone applies to over 3,200 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22">[03:22:22]</a>.
*   **Return on Assets (ROA):** One point is awarded if the current year's ROA is higher than the previous year's ROA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>. An increasing ROA indicates an improvement in asset utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:55">[03:55:55]</a>. Coal India, for instance, earned a point as its ROA increased from 10.2% to 14.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>. This condition was met by over 2,000 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:13">[04:13:13]</a>.
*   **Operating Cash Flow:** A company earns one point if its current year's operating cash flow (OCF) is higher than the preceding year's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:31">[04:31:31]</a>. This metric demonstrates how well a company manages its core business activities to generate money and cover expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:22">[04:22:22]</a>. Coal India showed improvement and received a point, while companies like Maruti Suzuki, Asian Paints, and Titan received zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:39">[04:39:39]</a>.
*   **Accruals (Earnings Quality):** One point is given if a company's cash from operations is greater than its net income (excluding extraordinary items) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:21">[05:21:21]</a>. This suggests superior and sustainable earnings quality, as profits are generated from core operations and are not prone to sharp fluctuations or accounting manipulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Coal India, for example, received zero points in some years (2018-2020) but began scoring points as its operational cash flow increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:42">[05:42:42]</a>.

### 2. Leverage, Liquidity, and Source of Funds (Maximum 3 points)

*   **Long-term Debt to Total Assets (Leverage):** One point is awarded if the current year's long-term debt to total asset ratio is lower than the previous year's, indicating a reduction in financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:13">[06:13:13]</a>. Coal India received zero points for this metric as its ratio increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:29">[06:29:29]</a>.
*   **Current Ratio:** One point is earned if the current year's current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) has improved compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:09">[07:09:09]</a>. A ratio greater than one indicates the company's ability to cover short-term financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:40">[06:40:40]</a>. Coal India, despite a healthy current ratio of 1.57, did not receive a point because it was lower than the preceding year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:01">[07:01:01]</a>.
*   **Share Issuances:** Companies that issue new shares are considered negatively and receive zero points for this criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:34">[07:34:34]</a>. This factor aims to identify companies with strong fundamentals, suggesting that new share issuances might imply financial instability or management's inability to generate sufficient internal funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:03">[08:03:03]</a>.

### 3. Operating Efficiency (Maximum 2 points)

*   **Gross Margin:** One point is awarded if the current year's gross margin is higher than the previous year's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:26">[08:26:26]</a>. Coal India, by delivering its highest gross profit margin in years, received one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:33">[08:33:33]</a>.
*   **Asset Turnover Ratio:** One point is given if the current year's asset turnover ratio (which indicates how well a company uses its assets to generate sales) exceeds the previous year's number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:56">[08:56:56]</a>. Coal India also showed an improvement in this ratio, earning an additional point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:04">[09:04:04]</a>.

## Piotroski Score in the Indian Market
When applied to the Nifty 200 set of companies, only four companies (Coal India, Varun Beverages, PI Industries, and Oil India Limited) achieved a perfect score of nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:50">[10:50:50]</a>. However, approximately 35% of companies across various market capitalizations in India have an F-score of 7, 8, or 9, indicating a significant number of fundamentally strong companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:06">[11:06:06]</a>.

[[backtesting_and_evaluating_piotroski_score_effectiveness | Backtesting]] a portfolio of high-scoring companies (Piotroski score of at least seven) showed returns over two years that were similar to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:39">[11:39:39]</a>. This suggests that while the Piotroski Score is valuable for assessing [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metrics for evaluating stocks]], it may miss crucial elements, particularly valuationsâ€”the price at which a fundamentally strong company becomes an attractive buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:02">[12:02:02]</a>.

## Modified Piotroski Score
Research from BITS Pilani proposed a [[modified_piotroski_score_incorporating_market_factors | modified Piotroski Score]] to achieve higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:18">[12:18:18]</a>. This modified approach:
*   Removed two original variables: Return on Assets (ROA) and Operating Cash Flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:27">[12:27:27]</a>.
*   Introduced four new variables to account for market factors, not just company financials:
    *   Price-to-Earnings (P/E) multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:39">[12:39:39]</a>
    *   Price-to-Book (P/B) value ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:43">[12:43:43]</a>
    *   Enterprise Value upon EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:46">[12:46:46]</a>
    *   Incremental changes in the firm's free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:51">[12:51:51]</a>

By incorporating market-driven metrics like P/E, P/B, and EV/EBITDA, the modified score aims to identify [[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | undervalued companies]] among fundamentally strong ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:07">[13:07:07]</a>. Additionally, the research team integrated technical indicators such as the moving average crossover (to identify uptrends for buying stocks) and the Average Directional Movement Index (to gauge trade strength) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:17">[13:17:17]</a>. Backtesting this modified 13-variable approach showed significant jumps in annualized returns and the Sharpe ratio, suggesting its potential effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:36">[13:36:36]</a>.

## Conclusion
The Piotroski Score provides a systematic approach for investors to evaluate and differentiate between promising and risky investment opportunities by focusing on profitability, leverage, liquidity, and operating efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:04">[14:04:04]</a>. While not foolproof (a score of nine can quickly change to five in the next year due to dynamic numbers), elements of this system can significantly improve the chances of selecting the right companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:18">[14:18:18]</a>. It serves as a foundational tool for [[analysis_of_financial_statements | analyzing a company's financial health]].

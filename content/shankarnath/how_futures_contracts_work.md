Some investors experience a form of "ethnophobia" when encountering complex financial instruments like the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was first encountered in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, understanding complex instruments like [[basics_of_futures_and_options | Futures and options]] can expand possibilities for making money, allowing investors to profit when the market goes up, goes down, or even remains relatively flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This article provides a beginner's guide to understanding what futures are and how they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Understanding Derivatives

Before delving into futures, it's important to understand what a [[understanding_derivatives_in_finance | derivative]] is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. A [[understanding_derivatives_in_finance | derivative]] is a type of financial contract whose value is dependent on an underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. For example, Nifty Futures is a [[understanding_derivatives_in_finance | derivative]] contract that derives its value from the Nifty 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The term "[[understanding_derivatives_in_finance | derivative]]" comes from the Latin word "derivare," meaning "obtained from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

[[understanding_derivatives_in_finance | Derivatives]] can obtain their value from various underlying assets, including:
*   A single stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   An index like the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   A basket of commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   Houses, crude oil, fruits, vegetables, coffee, or even gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

The Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) released by the Reserve Bank of India is essentially a [[understanding_derivatives_in_finance | derivative]] instrument that derives its value from the price of physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The global [[understanding_derivatives_in_finance | derivatives]] market is immense, reaching 700 trillion dollars, making it the largest asset class in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Types of Equity Derivatives
Specific to equities, there are five types of derivative contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>:
1.  Forwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
2.  Futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
3.  Options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
4.  Warrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>
5.  Swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

In some countries, forwards, warrants, and swaps are not as popular, so the focus is often on futures and options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## What is a Futures Contract?

A futures contract is a legal agreement that relates to the purchase or sale of a physical asset or security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. It specifies a predetermined price and a future time for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Real-World Example: Nestle and Coffee Beans
Consider Nestle, which sells coffee under its Nescaf√© brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The price of coffee beans, Nestle's main raw material, can be highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. To maintain predictable pricing for its product, Nestle (the buyer) and a coffee bean producer (the seller) might enter into a futures contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

In this contract, they agree on a price for coffee beans to be delivered three months from now, irrespective of the market price at that future date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This effectively locks in the price for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Typically, no money is exchanged at the time of the contract, except for an initial margin that the producer might request to reduce the risk of non-payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

Futures contracts are commonly used in agriculture, energy products, metals, currencies, and financial products such as indices, bonds, [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]], and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Futures in a Trading Platform: ICICI Bank Example

When looking at a trading platform, you'll typically see three future options for a stock like ICICI Bank: the current month's contract, and the contracts for the next two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. For example, if it's March, you'd see March, April, and May futures contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

*   **Expiry**: Any month's futures contract expires on the last Thursday of that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. When a contract expires (e.g., March), a new contract for three months ahead (e.g., June) is added to maintain the three-month sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Pricing**: If the ICICI Bank April Futures Contract is available at 845 rupees while a single share of ICICI Bank is 836 rupees, it means that regardless of the actual share price on the April expiry date, you will transact at 845 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The core essence is locking in a future price for a future date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Making Money from Futures Transactions

Making money from futures is similar to stock transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>:
*   **Squaring Off**: If the price of the futures contract goes above your predetermined price (e.g., above 845 rupees), you can sell or "square off" your existing position to make a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Conversely, selling at a lower price would result in a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **At Expiration**: On the day of the futures expiry, if the spot price (actual share price) of the underlying asset (e.g., ICICI Bank) goes up (e.g., to 870 rupees), the futures price will also align, resulting in a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. If the share price goes down, you incur a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Lot Size and Margin

Unlike shares that can be bought as single units, futures must be bought in "lots," which are predefined bunches of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This standardization helps traders understand pricing, risk, and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. For example, the ICICI Bank futures lot size is 700 shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

While a lot's total value can be substantial (e.g., 700 shares x 845 rupees = 5,91,000 rupees), an investor doesn't have to pay the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Instead, a partial amount called a "margin" is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. The margin acts like an advance payment, ensuring the contracting party honors their side of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. For instance, a margin of 1,09,000 rupees might be required for the ICICI Bank contract, which is about 18% of the total contract value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Available Futures Contracts

Besides individual stock futures like Reliance Futures, Tata Steel, and HDFC Bank Futures (currently 198 stocks with futures and options trading) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, the ever-popular [[function_and_advantages_of_the_nifty_1day_rate_index | Nifty Futures]] and [[function_and_advantages_of_the_nifty_1day_rate_index | Bank Nifty Futures]] are traded in huge volumes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Introduction to Options

Options are another type of financial [[understanding_derivatives_in_finance | derivative]] that give the holder the *right*, but not the *obligation*, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price and date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
When discussing [[option_trading_strategies | options trading]], terms like [[comparing_call_and_put_options | call option]] and [[comparing_call_and_put_options | put option]] are frequently used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

*   A **[[comparing_call_and_put_options | call option]]** grants its buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy an agreed quantity of a commodity or financial instrument from the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This right is valid within a specified time window, ending on the expiration date, and at a certain price called the strike price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. For this right, the buyer pays a small fee to the seller, known as a premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   A **[[comparing_call_and_put_options | put option]]** is essentially a [[comparing_call_and_put_options | call option]] in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The buyer of a [[comparing_call_and_put_options | put option]] anticipates a fall in the price of the underlying asset and wants to retain the right to sell it at a higher price until the expiry date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

These buying and selling of [[comparing_call_and_put_options | call options]] and [[comparing_call_and_put_options | put options]] form the four foundational paths of any [[option_trading_strategies | option strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. The choice depends on an investor's view of the market:
*   **Bullish**: Buy a [[comparing_call_and_put_options | call option]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, or sell a [[comparing_call_and_put_options | put option]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Bearish**: Sell a [[comparing_call_and_put_options | call option]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, or buy a [[comparing_call_and_put_options | put option]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Further insights into different ways to trade in [[basics_of_futures_and_options | Futures and options]] and various [[option_trading_strategies | strategies]] will be explored in future discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

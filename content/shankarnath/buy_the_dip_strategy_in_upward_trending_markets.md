The "buy the dip" approach involves purchasing securities whose price has experienced a temporary decline or "dip" within an overall upward trending market [08:41]. This strategy fundamentally requires two conditions:

*   A decline in stock price or index value, generally around a 15% to 20% reduction [08:55].
*   The dip must occur within an overall upward trending market [09:05].

Visually, this means the financial instrument is on a "nice big rising wave," and the goal is to capitalize on smaller blips or temporary declines within that larger trend [09:09].

## Key Indicators for Buy the Dip

Several technical indicators can help identify optimal entry and exit points for this strategy:

### 200-Day Moving Average (200 DMA)
The 200 DMA is an effective tool for determining optimal points for investing lump sum money [09:26]. A significant widening of the price gap, such as 17% to 20% above the 200 DMA, indicates that markets are expensive, suggesting it's time to consider exiting or at least avoiding further investment [09:32].

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
RSI is a popular indicator that can help identify entry and exit points for long-term investors [09:50].
*   **Entry Points**: When the RSI is below 30, it generally indicates an oversold condition, making it a potential entry point [10:03].
*   **Risk Management/Exit Points**: When the RSI goes above 70, it typically signals an overbought condition and suggests a correction may be due [10:09].
*   **Divergence Analysis**: Long-term investors can also use divergence analysis on RSI to spot a weakening trend, which can signal a potential exit [10:20].

## Strategy Effectiveness
While many investors associate a "buy the dip" strategy with a general market downturn, research suggests that the strategy is more effective when a price decline is combined with an overall market trend [10:27]. This approach allows investors to potentially gain an extra 0.5% to 1% in returns [03:18], which can amount to a significant sum over the long run [03:41]. For lump sum investments, going "big" when the buying zone appears and redeeming during the selling phase can result in significantly higher net gains [03:26].

## Related Strategies
This "buy the dip" approach is related to other investment strategies aimed at enhancing returns:

*   **[[trending_value_strategy_overview | Trending Value Strategy]]**: The concept of leveraging market trends and understanding valuation metrics (like P/E ratios) also informs when to be aggressive or defensive in the markets [11:03].
*   **Factor Investing**: Factors like [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]] and [[trending_value_strategy | value]] can lead to higher returns compared to market-cap-based portfolios [12:44]. Combining a momentum-based factor index with a value-based one has shown a CAGR of 16.2% over 17 years [13:43].

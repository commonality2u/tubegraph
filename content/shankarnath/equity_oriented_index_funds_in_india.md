The "Index Premier League" of passive investing in India comprises around 250 index funds, with approximately 150 dedicated to equity-oriented investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The objective is to identify top-performing funds and establish a framework for selecting the most suitable index for an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Landscape of Indian Indices

Nifty Indices Limited has developed a broad spectrum of indices, totaling 194 different types, categorized by market capitalization, sectors, themes, strategies, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Out of these, 66 have been converted into investable index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

When fixed-income options are excluded, a significant portion of these index funds are allocated to equity-oriented categories, including:
*   **Market-cap weighted indices:** Such as Nifty50, Sensex, Nifty Nex 50, Midcap 150, and Small Cap 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Equal-weighted indices:** For broader market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **International indices:** Providing exposure to global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **[[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | Sectoral and thematic indices]]:** Covering areas like banking, pharma, real estate, manufacturing, digital, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Strategy indices (Factor-based or Smart Beta Funds):** Rapidly gaining popularity, these include factors such as momentum, value, quality, and low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Currently, there are 35 such schemes available, with asset management companies (AMCs) adding new ones frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Performance Analysis Approach

To assess performance, comparisons are made between the index performance and the actual index fund performance, considering factors like expense ratios and tracking errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Analysis includes trailing returns (3, 5, 10, and 15 years), Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) returns, and rolling returns, which provide average returns over specific, continuously calculated periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Broad-Based Indices: Key Observations

The performance of broad-based indices reveals several trends:
*   **Returns Hierarchy:** Generally, large-cap and large-cap heavy indices have shown the lowest returns, while micro-cap and small-cap indices have delivered the highest returns on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Mid vs. Small Caps:** Historically, mid-cap funds have outperformed small-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Equal Weighting:** Equal-weighted versions of the Nifty50 and Nifty 100 indices have outperformed their market-cap weighted counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** The Midcap 150 and Small Cap 250 indices have significantly surpassed the Midcap 50 and Small Cap 50 indices, challenging the notion of over-diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Nifty Nex 50:** Despite less discussion, the Nifty Nex 50 remains a strong performer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Rolling Returns:** On a 10-year rolling basis, mid-caps and the Nifty Nex 50 index have performed particularly well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Impressively, none of the broad-based indices have experienced a negative 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Investment Likelihood:** For investors aiming for a minimum 12% return historically, the Nifty Nex 50 and Nifty Midcap 150 index offer better probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Example Picks for Broad-Based Indices:** Nifty Nex 50, Nifty Midcap 150, and Nifty Micro Cap 250 can offer adequate representation of large, mid, and tiny companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Strategy (Factor-Based) Indices

Strategy indices are based on specific characteristics beyond traditional market capitalization, such as momentum, quality, value, alpha, and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. While different factors perform differently at various times, some strategies have proven to be superior performers over the long run (10-15 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Top Performers:** Momentum indices (e.g., Nifty 200 Momentum 30, Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50) and the Nifty Alpha 50 (which selects high-alpha stocks using Jensen's measure) have shown excellent trailing performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Cyclicality:** These strategies experience periods of outperformance (e.g., 2014, 2017, 2020, 2021, 2023) and underperformance compared to market-cap-based indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Multi-Factor Strategies:** Some strategies combine multiple factors, such as alpha and low volatility, or momentum and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Comparison with Market-Cap Indices:** Barring two quality indices, most strategy indices have outperformed traditional market-cap-based indices over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Example Picks for Strategy Indices:** Nifty 200 Momentum 30, Nifty Alpha 50, and Nifty Small Cap 250 Quality 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## [[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | Sectoral and Thematic Indices]]

These indices comprise around 52 active schemes, broadly categorized into banking, financial services, auto, IT, healthcare/pharma, real estate/housing, manufacturing, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Cyclicality:** It is crucial to understand that these indices and their underlying companies are highly susceptible to business cycles, leading to significant highs and lows that can skew performance interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. For example, the Nifty Realty Index was the best performer over a 3-year period but the worst over 15 years, due to the 7-8 year real estate cycle in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Using trailing or rolling returns can be ineffective for these cyclical indices. A higher emphasis should be placed on fundamental metrics like growing order books, increased capacity, credit offtake, or disposable income trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Example Picks for Sectoral/Thematic Indices:** Nifty Manufacturing, Nifty Financial Services (due to their alignment with mega-trends), and Nifty Non-Cyclical Consumer index (for its good performance, lower volatility, and decent downside protection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## [[International Index Fund Options | International Index Schemes]]

There are approximately 14 [[International Index Fund Options | international index schemes]] available, with half dedicated to the NASDAQ 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **NASDAQ 100:** This index has historically performed very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   **Hang Seng Tech Index:** Considered an interesting contrarian inclusion, despite recent stock price underperformance, it offers better fundamental value (price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios) compared to the NASDAQ 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Rationale for International Picks:** These technology-oriented international picks can complement domestic indices, many of which lack significant IT sector participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

Combining broad-based, strategy, sectoral/thematic, and international indices can create a balanced portfolio that offers a mix of performance, market cap representation, diversification, and investment styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This framework helps investors make informed decisions about the vast array of equity-oriented index funds available in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

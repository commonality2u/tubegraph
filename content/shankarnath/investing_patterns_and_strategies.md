## Introduction: The "Defensive" Approach to Investing

Just as a strong defense wins titles in football, a robust defensive strategy is crucial in investing, especially concerning equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This approach focuses on building a portfolio that offers stability, possesses inbuilt resistance to economic downturns, exhibits low expected volatility, and aims to provide above-average stock market returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The ultimate goal is to present an [[Investment philosophy and strategy | investing sequence]] of defense and offense that can deliver significant annual returns even after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## What Defines a Defensive Business?

A defensive business produces goods and services that people continue to consume even during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. These sectors are less susceptible to economic fluctuations, meaning they are non-cyclical in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Key sectors that fit this description include:
*   **Utilities:** Essential for daily life, such as electricity, water, and gas connections, experiencing no significant decline in usage during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Services:** Including doctor visits, treatments, surgeries, and medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Education:** Often prioritized by families despite economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Personal Care Products:** Such as toothpaste, soap, shampoo, and face wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Household Goods:** Cleaning supplies and kitchen essentials necessary for maintaining a functional living space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Telecommunications:** Mobile plans and internet connections, which have become essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Identifying Defensive Stocks

Defensive stocks are also known as non-cyclical stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. They can be identified using several criteria:

### By Industry/Sector
One approach is to directly look for companies within the defensive sectors mentioned above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Examples include Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints, Bharti Airtel, and Avenue Supermarts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Stock screeners like screener.in or ticker tape can be used to filter companies by industry or sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### By Beta
A stock's beta measures its volatility relative to the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Defensive, non-cyclical stocks typically have a low beta, meaning they are less volatile than the broader market (e.g., the Nifty50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. A beta of less than one theoretically reduces the overall risk of a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. For instance, if the market falls by 10%, a stock with a low beta of 0.19 (like Hindustan Unilever) might only fall by 1.9% historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Other Characteristics
Non-cyclical stocks often possess:
*   A history of strong, consistent, and rising dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This aligns with [[Dividend Investing Strategies | dividend investing strategies]].
*   A strong balance sheet with low debt levels, enabling them to withstand economic downturns effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   Market leadership, established brands, and a dominant market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## [[Investment and portfolio growth strategies | Investment Approaches]] for Defensive Stocks

### Active Approach: Coffee Can Style
One active [[Investment strategies for wealth creation | investment strategy]] is the "coffee can" style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This involves:
1.  Selecting 15-20 defensive stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
2.  Investing an equal amount of money in each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
3.  Holding them for several years, anticipating significant returns from some performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Historically, a portfolio of defensive stocks has often outperformed broad market indices like the Nifty50 over 5, 7, and 10-year periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Passive Approach: Nifty Non-Cyclical Consumer Index (NCCI)
For a passively managed solution, the Nifty Non-Cyclical Consumer Index (NCCI) tracks the performance of a portfolio of stocks representing the non-cyclical consumer theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

#### NCCI Construction
The NCCI is constructed in four steps:
1.  **Identify Basic Industries:** Focuses on consumer-facing sectors such as consumer goods, telecom, media services, entertainment, textiles, and FMCG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
2.  **Select Largest Companies:** The 30 largest companies from these identified industries are selected based on their six-month average free-float market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This list is reviewed semi-annually in January and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
3.  **Assign Weights:** A specific weight is assigned to each stock based on its free-float market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
4.  **Risk Management:** The weightage of each stock within the index is capped at a maximum of 10% to manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

#### NCCI Performance and Characteristics
*   **Outperformance:** The NCCI has generally outperformed the Nifty50 and Nifty 500 over various time periods, with a total price return of 16.2% since its inception in April 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** The NCCI demonstrates remarkable consistency in returns year-on-year, unlike the more volatile Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Recession Proof:** In 2008, when the Nifty50 lost half its value, the NCCI gained 4.6%, showcasing its stability and ability to absorb economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Low Beta:** The NCCI's beta relative to the Nifty 500 averages around 0.78, indicating low volatility and making it a strong diversification tool, especially for portfolios heavy in large and mid-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## An [[Investment strategies for wealth creation | Alternating Investing Strategy]]

An interesting pattern observed is the tendency of the NCCI and Nifty50 to alternate in performance year-on-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This "cyclicity in a non-cyclical fund" can be converted into a solid [[Entry and exit strategies in investing | investing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>:

1.  **Annual Review:** At the beginning of each year, analyze the previous year's performance of both the NCCI and the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
2.  **Alternate Investment:** Invest in the index that performed *worse* in the previous year, assuming it will likely outperform in the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
3.  **Rebalancing:** At the end of the year, switch 100% of the investment to the alternate fund based on the new performance comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

This super-simple system, applied from 2007 to 2023, yielded a 17-year pre-tax Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 21.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Even after accounting for a 10% Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax, the annualized return was 19.9%, turning an initial ₹1 lakh into ₹21.7 lakhs (excluding dividends) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Investing in the NCCI

Currently, investors can access the NCCI through options like the HDFC Non-Cyclical Consumer Index Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This fund is suitable for investors seeking stable and consistent returns, and those with a relatively lower risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Risks and Considerations
While offering stability, the NCCI, like all equity investments, carries risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>:
*   **Underperformance Periods:** There will be times when the consumption theme may not perform as well as other sectors or the broader market, as observed after the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Valuation Risk (Lumpsum Investment):** The consumer theme in India often has high valuations (high P/E ratios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This makes the timing of entry and exit crucial for lump sum investments, especially if not holding for a decent period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Despite these risks, the NCCI provides a relatively stable way to participate in equities, offering low volatility and a degree of recession proofing, often yielding better returns than broader market indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The consumer sector in India also benefits from significant tailwinds, including rising GDP per capita, a young population, urbanization, and a growing organized sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

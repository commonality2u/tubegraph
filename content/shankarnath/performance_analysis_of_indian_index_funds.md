The "Index Premier League" (IPL) in passive investing, much like its cricketing counterpart, involves a selection from nearly 250 index funds available to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This analysis specifically focuses on [[equity_oriented_index_funds_in_india | equity oriented index funds]], numbering about 150, to identify the best-performing options over recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The goal is to evaluate indices available for investment based on trailing, annual, and rolling returns, ultimately aiming for a combination of 11 index funds and a framework to suit individual portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Overview of Indian Index Funds

Nifty Indices Limited has developed a wide array of indices, categorized by market cap, sectors, themes, strategies, bonds, and target maturity instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. As of the last count, 194 different indices had been created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While not all have corresponding investment schemes, 66 of these indices have been converted into index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Categories with the highest representation include:
*   Guilt indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   NIFTY50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   State Development Loan (SDL) indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Nifty Next 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

Excluding fixed income options, a significant portion of index funds are dedicated to market cap-weighted indices like the Nifty50, Sensex, Nifty Next 50, and Midcap 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Other types include equal-weighted indices (e.g., Small Cap 250), international indices, and sectoral/theme-based indices (e.g., banking, pharma, digital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Strategy indices, representing factors like momentum, value, quality, and low volatility, are also gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Broad-based Indices Performance

When analyzing [[performance_analysis_in_indian_stock_market | performance analysis in Indian stock market]], it's crucial to compare index returns with actual index fund returns, which account for expense ratios and tracking errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For example, while Nifty50 index funds might show higher 5-year trailing returns than the index itself, a deeper look at 3-year and 10-year CAGRs often reveals a performance differential due to these factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Key observations from broad-based indices include:
*   **Returns Hierarchy**: Larger cap indices generally perform the least, while micro-cap indices deliver the highest trailing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Mid vs. Small Caps**: Historically, mid-caps have outperformed small-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Equal Weighting**: Equal-weighted Nifty50 and Nifty 100 indices have outperformed their market cap-weighted counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: The Midcap 150 and Small Cap 250 indices have exceeded the Midcap 50 and Small Cap 50 by a significant margin, challenging the over-diversification playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Nifty Next 50**: Despite less discussion, it remains a strong performer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Data can be extracted from advisorcoach.com by selecting an index, choosing between SIP or lumpsum, and setting the start and end dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. SIP performance data may appear elevated due to recent stock market rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Rolling Returns Analysis

To mitigate market timing biases, [[performance_analysis_in_indian_stock_market | rolling returns]] provide a more robust view by calculating average returns continuously over different intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   Historically, mid-caps and, to some extent, the Nifty Next 50 index have performed well on a 10-year rolling basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   Impressively, none of the broad-based indices have shown a negative 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   The Small Cap 250 index has delivered below-inflation returns in one out of every ten occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   For those seeking a minimum 12% return, the Nifty Next 50 and Nifty Midcap 150 indices offer better historical chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

Based on this analysis, a recommended combination for a portfolio would include the Nifty Next 50 index, the Midcap 150, and the Nifty Micro Cap 250 index, providing representation across large, mid, and small companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Strategy (Factor-based) Indices Performance

Strategy indices, also known as smart beta funds, are based on specific characteristics beyond traditional market capitalization, such as momentum, quality, value, alpha, and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. There are currently 35 such schemes available, with more being added regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

While factors perform differently at various times, some strategies have shown superior [[performance_analysis_of_momentum_vs_value_funds | long-term performance]]:
*   [[performance_analysis_of_momentum_indices | Momentum indices]], such as the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 and Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50, have performed exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   The Nifty Alpha 50, which picks 50 high-alpha stocks using Jensen's measure, has been a top performer on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   It's important to note that strategy indices can have years of strong performance (e.g., 2014, 2017, 2020, 2021, 2023) and years of underperformance compared to market cap indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Some strategies combine multiple factors, such as alpha and low volatility, or momentum and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Detailed methodology documents for these strategies are available on the Nifty Indices website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Comparing strategy-based indices with their market cap-based counterparts reveals that, with the exception of two quality indices, strategy indices have generally outperformed traditional market cap-based indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Recommended strategy indices include:
*   Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
*   Nifty Alpha 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   Nifty Small Cap 250 Quality 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>

### Sectoral and Thematic Indices Performance

There are approximately 52 active sectoral and thematic schemes, broadly categorized into banking, financial services, auto, IT, healthcare and pharma, realty and housing, manufacturing, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. As index variants of these sectors are relatively recent, analysis often relies on the specific index performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

A critical consideration for these indices is their exposure to business cycles, which can significantly skew performance data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. For example:
*   The Nifty Realty Index was the best performer over a 3-year period but the worst over a 15-year period due to the 7-8 year real estate and housing cycle in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. It's still 45% away from its 2008 all-time high, despite significant growth since May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   The Nifty Auto index fell by 60% between 2018 and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   The Nifty Pharma index dropped by 45% between 2015 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   The Nifty India Digital index was static from 2015 until 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

For these indices, relying solely on trailing or rolling returns can be ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Greater emphasis should be placed on fundamental metrics like growing order books (real estate), increased capacity (manufacturing), credit offtake (financial services), or disposable income (auto) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Despite the cyclical nature, potential picks based on mega-trends and stability include:
*   Nifty Manufacturing index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>
*   Nifty Financial Services index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>
*   Nifty Non-Cyclical Consumer index (due to good performance, lower volatility, and decent downside protection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>

### International Index Schemes

There are approximately 14 international index schemes available, with half dedicated to the NASDAQ 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   The NASDAQ 100 has historically performed very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   The Hang Seng Tech index could be an interesting, albeit contrary, inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. While its stock price performance hasn't been strong, it offers more value than the NASDAQ 100 in terms of price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This choice is also supported by a view on the Chinese stock market potentially reaching maximum pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

These technology-oriented international picks help diversify the portfolio, as many selected domestic indices do not have significant IT sector participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

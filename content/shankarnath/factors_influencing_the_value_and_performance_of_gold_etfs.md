The price of gold has seen significant increases, with a one-year return of approximately 30%, surpassing the Nifty50's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. While the speaker has historically allocated a small portion (4-5%) of their portfolio to gold, its recent performance highlights its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

This article focuses on [[Benefits and Drawbacks of ETFs | investing in gold via ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)]], detailing how they work, their benefits, performance, and specific financial aspects.

## Why Invest in Gold?

Investing in gold is a long-standing strategy with several key [[benefits_of_investing_in_gold | benefits]]:
*   **Portfolio Diversifier** Gold is an effective [[gold_etfs_as_a_portfolio_diversifier | portfolio diversifier]] due to its low correlation with other asset classes like equities, which helps in reducing overall portfolio volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Hedge During Uncertain Times** Gold acts as a hedge, preserving wealth during market corrections, conflicts, and other uncertain periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Its price often moves inversely to inflation, interest rates, and currency depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Rarity** As a rare commodity, gold cannot be created. Estimates suggest only 52,000 tons are yet to be mined, contributing to its inherent value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Performance** Globally, gold has delivered long-term returns of approximately 9% over the past 40-45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. In the Indian context, this return is closer to 7.5-8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

While gold may not offer the highest returns compared to instruments like equities or real estate, its primary value lies in providing safety, diversification, and consistent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

## How Gold ETFs Work

Gold ETFs are an increasingly attractive option for [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | investing in gold]], especially after the Indian government lowered the import duty on gold from 15% to 6%, making physical gold, digital gold, ETFs, and gold mutual funds more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

### Key Features and Benefits
*   **Backed by Physical Gold** Gold ETFs predominantly invest in physical gold and gold-rated instruments. The ETF units are backed by physical gold with a purity of 99.5% or higher, a requirement set by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This contrasts with Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs), which are not physically backed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Price Parity** Unlike physical gold, which can have varying prices across different cities, Gold ETFs maintain price parity, ensuring consistent pricing regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Low Ticket Sizes** Investors can purchase Gold ETFs for as low as 1/100th of a gram of gold, making it highly accessible. For example, 1/100th of a gram can be as low as 78 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   **Safety and Storage** Since ETF units are held in dematerialized (demat) form, there are no concerns about theft or storage issues, which are common with physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   **Ease of Transaction** Gold ETFs can be bought and sold during market hours through a trading account without markups or limitations often associated with other gold investment alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Collateral for Loans** Gold ETFs can also serve as collateral for loans, providing an additional financial utility for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

For a detailed [[comparison_of_physical_gold_digital_gold_gold_etfs_and_gold_mutual_funds | comparison of Gold ETFs, physical gold, digital gold, and Sovereign Gold Bonds]], consider factors like holding form, safety, purity, pricing, tenure, liquidity, minimum investment, and lock-in period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

## Valuation of Gold ETFs

The valuation of gold, and by extension Gold ETFs, is governed by clear guidelines from SEBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   **Global Benchmark** The value of gold is primarily determined by its price on the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which serves as the global benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Conversion to Indian Rupees** LBMA prices are converted into Indian rupees by adding costs such as transportation from London to India, notional customs duties, taxes, and other levies associated with importing gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
*   **Operational Costs** Asset Management Companies (AMCs) appoint custodians to handle the physical gold, who then engage vaulting agencies for safe storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. These operational costs are covered by the Gold ETF's expense ratio, which includes charges for transport, storage, handling, and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   **Expense Ratio Cap** SEBI has set an upper limit of 1% for the total expense ratio of Gold ETFs, beneficial for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. However, investors should be aware of additional costs like demat charges, AMC charges, brokerage, and exchange transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

## Performance of Gold ETFs

When examining the [[risks_and_returns_associated_with_different_gold_investment_options | performance of Gold ETFs]], there is minimal difference (around 0.1%) across existing funds, suggesting that the choice of AMC might not significantly impact returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

*   **Recent Performance** In the last year, Gold ETFs delivered a return of 28.12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Medium-Term Performance** On a trailing 5-year basis, returns stood at a more consistent 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Performance** Gold's long-term return in the Indian context is approximately 7.5-8%, but a general expectation of 9% can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

### Gold's Role in Portfolio Stability
Gold and Gold ETFs are particularly valuable for cushioning market downturns. During events like the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis, or COVID-19, investors with gold in their portfolio experienced a "softer landing" compared to those without it, highlighting gold's ability to protect the downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

Studies indicate that allocating a moderate amount of gold (e.g., 15%) to a portfolio not only lowers volatility but can also lead to higher overall returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. A diversified portfolio with a mix of equity, debt, and gold, with annual rebalancing, can deliver higher risk-adjusted returns than a 100% equity portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

Therefore, allocating 5-10% of a portfolio to gold investments can enhance risk-adjusted returns and provide stronger downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

## Recent Catalysts for Gold ETFs

Gold ETFs have recently seen a surge in interest, with over 1,300 crore rupees invested in July alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. This surge is likely influenced by:
*   **Reduced Customs Duty** The recent reduction in customs duty on gold from 15% to 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.
*   **Budget Announcements and Tax Relaxation** Recent budget announcements have resulted in a reduced holding period for Gold ETFs and, in some scenarios, relaxed tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. It is advisable to consult a tax advisor for optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.
*   **Festive Season** The upcoming festive season, such as Diwali, also contributes to increased interest in gold investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

## Grow Gold ETF

The Grow Gold ETF is a recent offering whose New Fund Offer (NFO) closed on October 18th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.
*   **Objective** It is an open-ended exchange-traded fund designed to replicate the domestic price of physical gold based on LBMA's daily spot fixing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   **Asset Allocation** The ETF allocates 95-100% of its assets to physical gold and other gold-related instruments permitted by SEBI, with the remaining 0-5% in debt and money market instruments to manage redemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   **Fees and Accessibility** There is no exit load, and the maximum total expense ratio is capped at 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. It offers high accessibility, with each unit representing 0.01g of gold, and minimum investments as low as 500 rupees for the NFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Categorization** According to the riskometer, the scheme and its benchmark are categorized as high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.

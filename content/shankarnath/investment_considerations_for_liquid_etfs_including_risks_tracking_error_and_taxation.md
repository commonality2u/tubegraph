During periods of high market valuations and increased volatility, investors may find themselves indecisive, leading to unutilized funds in bank savings accounts or trading accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Such idle funds typically yield no returns in a margin account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> or very little (3-4%) in a savings account, which is also inconvenient for withdrawals and transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | Liquid ETFs]] offer a solution to this problem by providing a temporary parking space for money that continues to earn returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## What are Liquid ETFs?

[[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | Liquid ETFs]] are investment instruments that primarily invest in securities with a one-day maturity period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. These securities include [[the_use_of_repos_and_other_overnight_securities_in_liquid_etfs | Tri-party repos]], [[the_use_of_repos_and_other_overnight_securities_in_liquid_etfs | repos]], government securities, reverse repos, and other overnight securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Understanding Repurchase Agreements (Repos)

A repurchase agreement (repo) is a financial arrangement where an institution, like a bank, sells government securities to another institution (e.g., another bank or a mutual fund) with an agreement to repurchase them after a specified period, typically one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The institution selling the securities needs cash, and the buyer, having cash to lend, earns interest by buying and then agreeing to sell them back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This mechanism, also known as STS or treasury bills repurchase, is highly safe and earns income due to its one-day duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. [[the_use_of_repos_and_other_overnight_securities_in_liquid_etfs | Repos]] are widely used in India's money market for short-term liquidity management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## The Nifty 1-Day Rate Index

The Nifty 1-Day Rate Index serves as the benchmark for [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. It represents the overnight interest rate at which Indian banks lend to each other for a single day, based on the overnight call money rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The index calculates a weighted average of overnight call rates from actual market transactions, with details published on the Triparty Repo Dealing System via the Clearing Corporation of India's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

Historically, the Nifty 1-Day Rate Index has delivered between 5% and 6% on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Excluding the COVID years, its annual performance hovers around the 6% to 6.5% mark, which can be a reasonable expectation for returns from a [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. From April 1, 2014, to September 30, 2023, there were zero instances of this index yielding a negative return on any single day, demonstrating its safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. While a 100% guarantee of positive returns every trading day cannot be given, the evidence suggests a strong tendency for positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Benefits of Liquid ETFs

[[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_etfs | Liquid ETFs]] offer several [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_etfs | advantages]] for investors:

*   **Lower Risk**: The bulk of assets are invested in safe instruments like [[the_use_of_repos_and_other_overnight_securities_in_liquid_etfs | tri-party repos]], government securities, and reverse repos, leading to potentially lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The riskometer typically classifies them as low risk with relatively low credit and interest rate risk compared to other debt products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **High Liquidity**: Since [[different_types_of_etfs_and_investment_strategies | ETF]] units are traded on the stock exchange, they can be quickly converted to cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. They function like cash while offering potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | Liquid ETFs]] have transparent structures, providing daily disclosure of portfolio holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **No Securities Transaction Tax (STT)**: There is no STT on [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]], enhancing their attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Growth Option**: Choosing the growth option reinvests earned interest, allowing the Net Asset Value (NAV) to grow over time. Taxes apply only when units are sold, leading to potentially higher after-tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Collateral for Margin Trading**: [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | ETF]] units can be pledged as collateral for margin trading with a low haircut of approximately 5%, meaning 95% of the pledged value can be used as margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

## Investment Considerations

### Tracking Error

All [[different_types_of_etfs_and_investment_strategies | ETFs]], regardless of the fund house, will have a tracking error, which is the difference between the [[different_types_of_etfs_and_investment_strategies | ETF]]'s performance and its benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. As [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] are relatively new (most schemes are a week to a year old), their tracking error will take time to stabilize, as it's influenced by variables like Assets Under Management (AUM), [[understanding_etf_costs_and_taxation | expense ratio]], and trading volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Expense Ratio

The [[understanding_etf_costs_and_taxation | expense ratio]] is an important factor to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Some schemes have a low [[understanding_etf_costs_and_taxation | expense ratio]] of around 0.2%, while others can be as high as 0.7%, a significant difference that investors should watch out for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Exit Load

For [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]], which are typically used for short-term parking, the exit load is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. While most checked schemes had a nil exit load, it is advisable for investors to verify this for their preferred scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

### Minimum Investment

[[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | Liquid ETFs]] can be purchased during trading hours in lots as low as one unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. For example, the Groww Nifty 1-Day Rate Liquid ETF is listed on the NSE under the symbol GROWLIQUID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Lock-in Period

There is no lock-in period for [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Taxation

Regarding [[understanding_etf_costs_and_taxation | taxation]], recent budget changes are believed to have not significantly impacted debt [[different_types_of_etfs_and_investment_strategies | ETFs]], especially in the context of these short-term [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. However, it is always recommended to consult a tax advisor or CA for personalized advice and to confirm any specific tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Nifty 1-Day Rate [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | Liquid ETFs]] provide investors with a unique opportunity to park idle cash in a low-risk, highly liquid asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. With benefits such as flexible trading, daily transparency, and the absence of STT, they serve as a practical short-term saving solution for all types of investors, regardless of whether they invest in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

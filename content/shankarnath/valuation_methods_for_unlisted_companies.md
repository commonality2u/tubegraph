[[Unlisted shares and their market | Unlisted shares]] are those that have not yet been listed on a stock exchange. They are also known as pre-IPO shares or private equity shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Examples include young, high-growth companies like Byju's, OYO, and Ola, established companies such as the National Stock Exchange and Serum Institute of India, subsidiaries like Jio, Flipkart, and Reliance Retail, and even companies that have delisted like Otis Elevators and Capgemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

While these shares can be traded frequently via the Over-The-Counter (OTC) market, also known as the gray market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, trading in unlisted shares is not illegal in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. However, these markets are not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), leading to less transparency and more risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Significance of Valuation

Understanding the [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | fair value of an unlisted share]] is an important area of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. In its simplest form, a share's fair value is the price at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would agree to trade, assuming both parties have adequate information and act rationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### Challenges in Valuing Unlisted Shares
The biggest challenge in valuing [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] is the lack of information, meaning there is no definitive or objective way to calculate their fair value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Additionally, price discovery is often more of a negotiation than a fixed rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Intrinsic Value Calculation Methods

Despite the challenges, there are three commonly used methods for valuing unlisted companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### 1. Comparable Company Analysis Method
Also known as relative valuation, this method involves comparing the unlisted company with its peers or competitors within the same industry or sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Analysts use [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation multiples]] like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book Value (P/B) ratio, and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio to estimate the company's fair value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

*   **Example**: To figure out the price per share of Bundle Technologies Private Limited (Swiggy), which is currently not listed, it can be compared with Zomato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. For companies like Shriram Life Insurance, HDB Financial Services, MobiKwik, or Capital Small Finance Bank, multiple comparisons can be drawn to arrive at a measured valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method
This method is primarily for equity analysts rather than everyday investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. It involves projecting the future cash flows of the unlisted company and discounting them to their present value using an appropriate discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This present value of cash flows represents the fair value of the company, which can then be divided by the number of shares to get the fair value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

### 3. Asset-Based Method
This is a simpler method where the total liabilities are deducted from the total assets of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The remaining net assets represent the fair value of the company, which can be divided by the number of shares to determine the fair value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

Each of these methods is best suited for a particular type of industry or sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. For beginners in valuations, it is advisable to research further and gather more information on how companies are valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

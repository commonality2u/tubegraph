A stock screener is a powerful tool designed to filter through thousands of stocks based on specific financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These metrics can include variables from financial statements like the balance sheet, profit & loss (P&L) statements, and cash flow statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. They also incorporate price-based information such as share price, return, market cap, moving averages, and RSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Users can filter by ratios like dividend yield, P/E multiple, book value, asset turnover, and even non-standard variables like credit rating, Proski score, and analyst recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Popular stock screening platforms include screener.in, ticker tape, trend line, and stock edge, with some even leveraging AI for enhanced capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Defining Your Screening Objective

Before crafting queries, it's crucial to understand the objective and the insights you aim to extract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. A common, yet too broad, objective is simply seeking a "list of 10 multibagger stocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Instead, it's more effective to break down this goal into manageable sub-goals, using a "divide and conquer" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Screening for Specific Situations

Screeners can identify companies undergoing particular situations that may present profitable opportunities:

### Capacity Expansion
Companies that are rapidly expanding their capacity might see increased orders and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This can be identified by looking at the "gross block" or "net block" functionality on a screener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Query Example:** Gross block (current year) is at least two times the preceding year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Sky Gold was identified through such a query, which had significantly increased its facility size, leading to a jump in sales and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Turnaround Stories
A turnaround occurs when a company posts two or three consecutive quarters of profits after struggling for several quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   *Example:* Sami Hotels was noted for delivering four quarters of profits after years of losses, identifiable through a turnaround query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Efficiency Improvement
Efficiency can be measured in various ways, such as Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and operating margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** Shows how efficiently a company generates profits from its total capital (debt and equity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Screeners can identify companies consistent with their ROCE over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Operating Margins (EBITDA / Sales):** Visible growth in operating margins is a positive sign, though sectoral cyclicity should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Other Situational Variables
Additional variables for screening include:
*   Price breakouts using moving averages, RSI, and volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Changes in promoter holdings (indicating insider buying or selling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Analyst upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

When using screeners, it's generally more effective to use simple queries rather than overly long or complex ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Complex queries risk missing the one or two central factors that drive a company's stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## [[Investing patterns and strategies | Investing Strategies]] using Screeners

Screeners can be tailored to align with various [[Investing patterns and strategies | investment strategies]]:

### Growth Investing
[[Investing patterns and strategies | Growth investing]] focuses on companies with significant revenue growth, earnings growth, and business expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

*   **GARP (Growth at Reasonable Prices):** This strategy combines growth and valuation variables. It uses a mix of revenue growth, EPS, and PEG ratio to identify potential stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
    *   *Note:* The PEG ratio displayed on most screening platforms might not be entirely accurate, as the denominator often uses a 5-year profit growth rate instead of the expected EPS growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

*   **[[Small cap investing strategy | Small Cap Hypergrowth Query]]:** This targets companies under â‚¹5,000 Cr market cap that have shown high year-on-year growth and significant capital expenditure (capex) in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Earnings growth is sometimes excluded as these growing companies can be volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

*   **Disruptive/Innovative Companies:** Identifying these involves looking for high revenue growth, R&D expenses at least 10% of sales, customer growth over 50%, recurring revenue of 70% or more, high gross margins, heavy insider ownership (especially institutional), and rapidly rising market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Building a query for this on Indian screeners can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Value Investing Strategies
[[Investing patterns and strategies | Value investing]] involves buying undervalued companies with strong fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

*   **Benjamin Graham's NCAV Rule:** Looks for companies where the market cap is less than two-thirds of their Net Current Asset Value (NCAV), which is current assets minus all debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. These companies are considered undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

*   **Warren Buffett Method:** While less rigid, a screener query for this method combines various ratios: current asset ratio, debt-related ratios, return metrics (ROE, ROC), sales and earnings growth, free cash flow, and a relatively low price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This can yield a good set of small and micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

*   **James O'Shaughnessy's Trending Value Strategy:** Utilizes a combination of variables like P/E ratio, price-to-book, price-to-sales, and EV/EBITDA to arrive at a combined score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

### Other [[Investing patterns and strategies | Investing Strategies]]
Screeners can also support other strategies:
*   **Coffee Can Portfolio:** Built using a combination of consistent sales growth and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Price Momentum:** Queries use moving averages, 52-week highs, three-month returns, volumes, and RSI to identify companies with excessively accelerating stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Earnings Momentum:** Combines profit-related variables with sales growth and price momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Contrarian Strategy / Losers Portfolio:** Involves exploring companies with falling stock prices and a low relative P/E ratio, but showing rising revenues and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## [[Tips for building effective stock screener queries | Tips for Building Effective Stock Screener Queries]]

When creating custom screeners or combining strategies, keep these suggestions in mind:
1.  **Avoid Too Many Variables:** A large number of variables often leads to unworkable results. Instead, pick only those variables that perfectly fit your chosen [[Investing patterns and strategies | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
2.  **Screeners are for Screening, Not Picking:** Always conduct thorough research on companies that appear in the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
    *   **Quantitative Factors:** Research the order book, new products, demand, and supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
    *   **Qualitative Factors:** Evaluate management, competitive advantages, and sector tailwinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   Remember, a screener is a "screener," not a "picker." It's just the first part of the investment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
3.  **Be Wary of False Positives:** A stock might look attractive on paper, but this could be due to sector cyclicity, a value trap, or metrics being at their peak, potentially leading to downward mean reversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
4.  **Acknowledge Strategy Cycles:** Every strategy or query will have good and bad periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The list of companies from a query is likely to change every few months, making rigorous examination of what enters and exits your shortlist crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

In conclusion, while screeners are valuable starting points ("first gear") for identifying potential investments, there's no magical formula for instantly finding future [[Investment Strategies for Multibagger Stocks | multibagger stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The more difficult skill lies in picking the right company from the filtered list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. It's recommended to spend time understanding each variable, start with simple queries, and always follow up with a thorough examination of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

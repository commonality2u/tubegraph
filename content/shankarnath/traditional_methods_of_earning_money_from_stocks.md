Traditionally, there are two primary ways to earn money from stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Dividends

One traditional method is through [[dividend_investing_strategies | dividends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These are periodic payments received by shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Capital Gain

The second traditional method is capital gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, which refers to an increase in the share price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## An Alternative Approach

Beyond these traditional methods, there exists a third way to earn income from stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This method involves "giving your stocks on rent" and earning money from them, similar to renting out a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This mechanism is known as SLBM, the Stock Lending and Borrowing Mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

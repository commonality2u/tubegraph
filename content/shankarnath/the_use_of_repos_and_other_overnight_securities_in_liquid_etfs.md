Investors often face indecision during periods of high market valuation and volatility, leading to unutilized funds in savings or trading accounts that earn no returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | Liquid ETFs]] offer a solution by providing a temporary parking space for money, ensuring it continues to work even during short periods of inactivity between trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This article explores how [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] utilize repurchase agreements (repos) and other overnight securities to offer a low-risk, high-liquidity investment option.

## What Are Liquid ETFs?

[[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | Liquid ETFs]] are investment instruments that primarily invest in securities with a one-day maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. These securities include:
*   Tri-party repos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>
*   Repos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>
*   Government securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>
*   Reverse repos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>
*   Other overnight securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>

### Understanding Repurchase Agreements (Repos)

A repurchase agreement, or repo, is a financial arrangement primarily used by institutions like banks to obtain short-term loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This mechanism helps them balance assets and liabilities, ensuring parity between deposits taken and loans given out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Initial Sale**: An institution (e.g., a bank) needing cash sells government securities to another institution (e.g., another bank or mutual fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Agreement to Repurchase**: The seller simultaneously agrees to repurchase these securities back after a specified period, typically one day for [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
3.  **Interest Earning**: The buyer, who lends the cash, purchases these securities with an agreement to sell them back to the borrower at a future date, earning interest in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

This borrowing mechanism is also known as STS or treasury bills repurchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. The fact that these transactions occur over a single day makes them very safe for all parties, including investors in [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]], while also generating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Repos are widely used in India's money market to manage short-term liquidity needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## Liquid ETFs as a Safe Alternative

Given that [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] are almost entirely composed of these repo instruments, they emerge as a "super safe alternative" for parking money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. They function like cash, offering potential returns alongside high liquidity and ease of buying and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. For both retail and institutional investors, [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] help manage the transition between equity and cash smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

### Managing Idle Funds: An Example

Consider two scenarios for funds from selling stocks:
*   **Scenario 1 (Traditional)**: Selling â‚¹1 lakh worth of stocks today means the proceeds are credited to your margin account the next trading day (T+1). If you withdraw to a savings account, you earn a low 3-4%, and if left idle in the margin account, you earn nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Scenario 2 (Using Liquid ETFs)**: On the day you sell your stocks, you can buy units of a [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETF]] like the Grow Nifty 1-day rate liquid ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. You start earning returns on these units from the first day of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. When you find a new stock to buy days later, you sell your [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETF]] units and use the proceeds for the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. During this period, the [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETF]] invests your money into one-day securities (repos), earning interest for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

This demonstrates how [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] serve as a temporary parking space that keeps your cash working, even during short-term inactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

## The Nifty 1-Day Rate Index

The Nifty 1-day rate index is the benchmark for all [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]], including the Grow Nifty 1-day rate liquid ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: It represents the overnight interest rate at which Indian banks lend to each other for a single day, based on the overnight call money rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Calculation**: The index calculates a weighted average of overnight call rates based on actual market transactions reported on platforms like the Tri-party Repo Dealing System <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Historically, the Nifty 1-day rate index has delivered between 5-6% on a trailing basis and around 6-6.5% annually, excluding COVID years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Crucially, across over 2,400 observations from April 1, 2014, to September 30, 2023, there have been zero instances of this index yielding a negative return on any single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. This demonstrates its remarkable safety and tendency to offer positive returns on most days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

To invest, look for [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] with the suffix "Nifty one-day rate liquid ETF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. These [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] are suitable for all types of investors because they help manage idle funds, facilitate transitions between equity and cash, and act as a cushion against volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Liquid ETFs

[[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | Liquid ETFs]] offer several advantages:
*   **Lower Risk**: A bulk of their assets are invested in safe instruments like tri-party repos, government securities, reverse repos, and treasury bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. The riskometer classifies them under "low risk" with relatively low credit and interest rate risk compared to other debt products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
*   **High Liquidity**: Since [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] units are traded on the stock exchange, they allow for quicker conversion to cash when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.
*   **Transparent Structures**: Nifty 1-day rate [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] provide daily disclosure of portfolio holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.
*   **No Securities Transaction Tax (STT)**: This enhances their attractiveness for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Option**: If the growth option is chosen, interest earned is reinvested, allowing the Net Asset Value (NAV) to grow. Taxes apply only upon sale, resulting in potentially higher after-tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.
*   **Collateral for Margin Trading**: [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] units can be pledged as collateral for margin trading with a low haircut of around 5%, meaning 95% of the pledged value can be used as margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

### [[investment_considerations_for_liquid_etfs_including_risks_tracking_error_and_taxation | Investment Considerations for Liquid ETFs]]

While beneficial, there are a few points to consider:
*   **[[investment_considerations_for_liquid_etfs_including_risks_tracking_error_and_taxation | Tracking Error]]**: Every [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] will have a tracking error. As this category is relatively new (schemes are only a week to a year old), the tracking error may take time to stabilize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
*   **Expense Ratio**: Be mindful of the expense ratio, as it can vary significantly among schemes (e.g., from 0.2% to 0.7%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
*   **Exit Load**: For short-term parking, an exit load would be undesirable. While schemes checked currently have nil exit loads, it's advisable to re-verify for your chosen scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   **Minimum Investment**: [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] can be bought in lots as low as one unit during trading hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. The Grow Nifty 1-day rate liquid ETF (symbol: GROWLIQUID) is listed on the NSE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
*   **Lock-in Period**: There is no lock-in period for these [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
*   **[[investment_considerations_for_liquid_etfs_including_risks_tracking_error_and_taxation | Taxation]]**: While recent budget changes might not have significantly impacted debt [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]], especially short-term parking solutions like [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]], it is always recommended to consult a CA or tax consultant for personalized advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

In conclusion, Nifty 1-day rate [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid ETFs]] offer investors a unique opportunity to park idle cash in a low-risk, highly liquid asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

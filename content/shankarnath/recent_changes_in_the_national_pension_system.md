The National Pension System (NPS) has undergone numerous modifications and adjustments since its inception, much like a startup evolving over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These changes, enacted by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), aim to enhance the system's flexibility, convenience, and subscriber experience. This article compiles some of the significant updates from the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Key Revisions and Enhancements

### Clarifications and Previous Misconceptions

Previously, there were some misunderstandings regarding NPS rules. It is now confirmed that an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) **can** invest in NPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Additionally, [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | NPS subscribers]] can now choose different pension fund managers for different asset classes, a flexibility introduced since last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Investment Flexibility and Fund Manager Performance

Subscribers can leverage the flexibility to select fund managers based on their performance across various asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Unlike mutual funds, switching between schemes or fund managers within NPS does not incur tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Based on an Ed Money study:
*   **Equities (Class E)**: HDFC, ICICI, and Kotak schemes have performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Government Securities**: LIC, HDFC, and Aditya Birla are among the top three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Corporate Bonds**: HDFC, Aditya Birla, and SBI show the best returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### [[impact_of_revised_withdrawal_rules_on_nps_subscribers | Revised Withdrawal Rules]]: Systematic Lumpsum Withdrawal (SLW)

A significant change allows [[impact_of_revised_withdrawal_rules_on_nps_subscribers | NPS subscribers]] to withdraw the 60% tax-free portion of their accumulated corpus either as a lumpsum or on a periodic basis, known as Systematic Lumpsum Withdrawal (SLW) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This option becomes available upon reaching 60 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

*   **Withdrawal Modes**: Payments can be received monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually, up to the age of 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Tax Implications**: Similar to a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) in mutual funds, SLW receipts from the 60% portion are understood to be tax-exempt, aligning with Section 10(12A) of the Income Tax Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, it is advisable to consult a tax advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: This facility offers a significant relief, allowing subscribers to manage their expenses with regular payments while the remaining corpus continues to grow within NPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Mandatory Penny Drop Verification

Effective October 2022, a mandatory "penny drop" verification process has been introduced by the PFRDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This involves depositing a small amount (e.g., ₹1-₹2) into the subscriber's bank account to authenticate details before disbursing funds to the beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This measure helps prevent issues like name mismatches or incorrect account details, ensuring timely fund credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This applies to NPS, Atal Pension Yojana, and NPS Lite, and also for any bank account modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Unified View of Investments (CAS Integration)

A welcome update allows for a unified view of personal investments, integrating NPS account values with the Consolidated Account Statement (CAS) provided by SEBI-registered depositories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Integration**: Central Recordkeeping Agencies (CRAs) like CAMS, KFintech, and Protean were allowed to integrate the NPS Statement of Transaction with the CAS as per a PFRDA circular from August 10, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Consent-Based**: Subscribers must enable this feature by registering on the respective CRA websites, providing their Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN) and other details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Equity Exposure Limits

In October 2022, the PFRDA modified the equity exposure rules for NPS accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Active Choice (Tier 1)**: Subscribers can now maintain up to 75% allocation to equity even after crossing 51 years of age, without the previous gradual reduction until the age of 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Tier 2 Accounts**: For Tier 2 accounts, subscribers can allocate up to 100% in equity, an increase from the earlier 75% limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Multiple Annuity Options

As of May 2023, NPS subscribers who earmark an annuity corpus of more than ₹10 lakh can now choose multiple annuity schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: This allows diversification across a broader range of annuity options, with a minimum of ₹5 lakh utilized per annuity scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: It also provides greater flexibility to choose different payout options (e.g., monthly from one, annual from another) to align with cash flow requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Simplified Annuity Payments

Effective April 1, 2023, the PFRDA has mandated the upload of certain documents to simplify and expedite annuity payments upon a subscriber's exit from NPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Required Documents**: These include the NPS exit/withdrawal form, proof of identity and address, bank account copy, and PRAN card copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Reduced Paperwork**: Since 2022, subscribers are no longer required to complete a separate proposal form for selecting an annuity; the exit form now doubles as the annuity proposal form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This significantly reduces processing time for life insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Reduced Settlement Time

In August 2022, the PFRDA announced a reduction in NPS settlement time from a T+4 to a T+2 working day cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This means withdrawal requests authorized by 11:00 AM will be settled within two working days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This faster processing applies to various withdrawal types, including superannuation, premature exit, death, annuity, Tier 2 withdrawals, partial withdrawals, and rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### UPI Contributions

The integration of Unified Payment Interface (UPI) for NPS contributions has evolved for greater convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Early Stages**: Initially, UPI payments up to ₹2,000 were allowed in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. In 2022, subscribers could use a complicated UPI handle for contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **QR Code**: In December 2023, the regulator enabled contributions via QR codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Investors can now generate personalized QR codes for their Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts and contribute by scanning them with any UPI-enabled app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This streamlines the process, making it faster, easier, and less prone to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### Removal of Credit Card Contributions for Tier 2

Effective August 2022, the PFRDA removed credit cards as a payment instrument for contributions to Tier 2 NPS accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. While credit cards can still be used for Tier 1 contributions, this move aligns with the general discouragement of using credit for investments, especially since Tier 2 accounts are similar to mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### Outlook

The PFRDA and NPS intermediaries continue to work on further improvements, including product enhancements, user interface improvements, reduction in charges, quicker turnaround times, and better customer service to encourage greater adoption of NPS as a [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement planning]] tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

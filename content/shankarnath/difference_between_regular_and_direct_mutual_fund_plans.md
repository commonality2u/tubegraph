Mutual funds in India are available in two primary variants: regular plans and direct plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Understanding the distinction between these two is crucial for optimizing investment returns.

## Regular Plans

Regular plans involve an intermediary such as a broker, agent, or banker in the investment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. A commission is paid to this intermediary, which can be as high as one percent annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This commission effectively reduces the investor's net returns. For example, if a fund yields a 12% return, an investor in a regular plan might only receive an 11% return due to the commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Direct Plans

In contrast, direct plans do not involve any intermediary. This means no commission needs to be paid to a broker, agent, or banker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. As a result, investors in direct plans benefit from the full returns generated by the mutual fund scheme.

## Impact of Commissions

The seemingly small one percent difference in returns due to commissions in regular plans can lead to a significant difference in accumulated wealth over time.

Consider an illustration:
*   **Monthly SIP**: ₹10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
*   **Tenure**: 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   **Assumed Fund Return (Direct Plan)**: 12%
*   **Assumed Fund Return (Regular Plan)**: 11% (after 1% commission)

| Plan Type    | Assumed Return | Accumulated Corpus (approx.) |
| :----------- | :------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Regular Plan | 11%            | ₹85 Lakhs                    |
| Direct Plan  | 12%            | ₹96 Lakhs                    |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>

This example shows that investing in a regular plan could result in paying approximately ₹12 lakhs in commission to a mutual fund agent over two decades, simply for facilitating the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Recommendation

While financial agents can offer valuable advice, investors are generally advised to opt for direct plans wherever possible, particularly for SIPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The savings from avoiding commissions can substantially increase the final corpus over the long term.

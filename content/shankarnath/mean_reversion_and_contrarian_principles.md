The "Losers Portfolio" is an investment strategy that involves intentionally investing in stocks that have performed poorly, specifically those that have experienced significant price declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:09">[01:44:09]</a>. The term "significant" is subjective, but a common cutoff applied for this strategy is a maximum drop of 50% in stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:09">[02:04:09]</a>. Companies with more severe drops (e.g., Rajesh Exports, Raj Rayon Industries in one example) are excluded, as such declines might indicate fundamental issues with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a>. Instead, companies like Primo Chemicals, Best Agrolife, and Delta Corp might qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:09">[02:35:09]</a>.

Initially, a subscriber, Mr. AKA Chan, tracked and invested in a "Losers Portfolio" based on stocks the presenter had previously identified, yielding "handsome returns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. This inspired a detailed examination of the strategy, its history, performance, and eligible stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.

## Conceptual Basis: Mean Reversion and Contrarian Principles

The inspiration for the "Losers Portfolio" strategy comes from an analysis cited by Professor Aswath Damodaran in his book *Investment Fables* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:09">[02:47:09]</a>. Damodaran's analysis suggested that buying the 35 biggest losers over the previous year and holding them for the next five years could generate a cumulative excess return of 30% over the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:09">[02:55:09]</a>.

The conceptual reasons why the "Losers Portfolio" might work are rooted in two key principles:

*   **Mean Reversion:** This principle suggests that if a stock's price has fallen significantly, it will generally tend to revert or rise back towards its long-term average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:09">[03:14:09]</a>. This reversion can create opportunities for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:09">[03:19:09]</a>.
*   **[[contrarian_investing_principles | Contrarian Principles]]:** By investing in a "Losers Portfolio," an investor is acting against the prevailing market sentiment or "the herd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:09">[03:24:09]</a>. Many studies have shown that adopting a [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian investing strategy]] can be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:09">[03:29:09]</a>.

## Performance Analysis in the Indian Stock Market

To assess the efficacy of this strategy in the Indian stock market, a 10-year study was conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:09">[03:42:09]</a>.

### Methodology
The study involved:
1.  **Compiling Data:** Extracting a list of 1,348 companies with a market capitalization over 1,000 crores that were in existence from 2014 onwards, acknowledging a survivorship bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:09">[05:27:09]</a>.
2.  **Pulling Closing Prices:** Obtaining financial year closing prices (as of March 31st) for all 1,348 stocks from 2014 onwards using Google Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:09">[06:17:09]</a>.
3.  **Selecting Losers:** For each year, identifying the 35 worst performers that exceeded a 50% price drop from April of the previous year to March of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:09">[06:38:09]</a>.

### Historical Performance (2015-2023)
The study tracked the performance of hypothetical investments in these "Losers Portfolios," assuming an investment of 10,000 rupees in each of the 35 selected stocks annually (total outlay of 3.5 lakh rupees per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:09">[07:02:09]</a>.

*   **FY 2015 Portfolio (tracked to March 2016):** Delivered a 55% return, significantly outperforming the Nifty 500 which returned -6.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:09">[07:09:09]</a>.
*   **FY 2016 Portfolio (tracked to March 2017):** Delivered a 51% return, while the Nifty 500 grew by 25.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:09">[07:33:09]</a>.
*   **FY 2017 Portfolio (tracked to March 2018):** Delivered 23% compared to Nifty 500's 12.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:09">[07:49:09]</a>.
*   **FY 2018 Portfolio (tracked to March 2019):** Underperformed significantly, delivering -9% while the Nifty 500 gained 9.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:09">[07:57:09]</a>. This drop coincided with a significant decline in mid and small-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:09">[08:10:09]</a>.
*   **FY 2019 Portfolio (tracked to March 2020 - COVID impact):** Lost 54% in value, while the Nifty 500 lost approximately 27% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:09">[08:31:09]</a>.
*   **FY 2020 Portfolio (tracked to March 2021 - recovery year):** Grew by 231% against Nifty 500's 77% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:09">[08:53:09]</a>.
*   **FY 2021 Portfolio (tracked to March 2022):** Grew by 9% against Nifty 500's -1.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:09">[09:02:09]</a>.
*   **FY 2022 Portfolio (tracked to March 2023):** Underperformed again, yielding -11.8% while the Nifty 500 returned 40.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:09">[09:10:09]</a>.

Overall, the "Losers Portfolio" tends to perform well in bull markets but performs poorly during sharp market corrections or bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:09">[08:45:09]</a>. Mathematically, over a nine-year period, the "Losers Portfolio" has ironically "won the performance battle" against the broader index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:09">[09:32:09]</a>.

## Key Observations for Implementation

### Treat as a System
The "Losers Portfolio" is designed to work as a system, and strict adherence to its rules is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:09">[10:21:09]</a>.
*   **Variability of Returns:** Individual stocks within the portfolio can show extreme variability. For instance, in the FY 2015 list, one stock, Dwarikesh Sugar, grew over 10 times in a single year, significantly boosting the portfolio's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:09">[10:45:09]</a>.
*   **Impact of Outliers:** Removing just four high-performing stocks (Orchid Pharma, Best Agrolife, Pangali Foods, and Raj Rayon Industries) from a previous "contrarian strategies" portfolio that had a 5-year CAGR of 91% caused the annual return to crash to 31% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:09">[11:34:09]</a>. This highlights the importance of holding the entire diversified portfolio as a system rather than selling individual winners too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:09">[10:57:09]</a>. This aligns with [[portfolio_management_and_rebalancing_for_trending_value_strategy | portfolio management and rebalancing]] principles.

### Optimal Holding Period
Analysis of trailing returns over nine years suggests that the first, second, and third years are generally the most profitable for "loser stocks," with the "bump up" dissipating over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:09">[12:11:09]</a>. Excluding the outlier COVID years (March 2020 and recovery year March 2021), the early years consistently show higher profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:09">[12:22:09]</a>. Therefore, a holding period of one, two, or a maximum of three years is recommended for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:09">[12:36:09]</a>.

### Long-Term Performance
If one were to invest 10,000 rupees in the top 35 "loser stocks" every year from 2015 until 2023 (a staggered investment of approximately 31.5 lakh rupees), the portfolio's value as of March 31, 2024, would have been a staggering 2.23 crore rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:09">[12:57:09]</a>. This translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:09">[13:23:09]</a>. In comparison, the Nifty 50 delivered 14.7%, and even one of the best-performing actively managed mutual funds, the Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund, delivered 21.5% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:09">[13:31:09]</a>.

It is important to acknowledge the survivorship bias in this analysis, as companies that delisted or ceased to exist during the study period were not included, which would likely reduce actual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:09">[13:55:09]</a>. However, investing is a game of probabilities, and the "Losers Portfolio" remains worthy of consideration as a small experiment due to its probable adequate performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:09">[14:12:09]</a>.

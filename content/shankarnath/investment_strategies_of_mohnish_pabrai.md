[[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Mohnish Pabrai]] is a renowned investor whose primary occupation involves running the Pabrai Investment Funds, which manages over $700 million in Assets Under Management (AUM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. He gained significant public attention after paying $650,000 for a lunch with [[Warren Buffett]] in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Beyond his investment work, [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]] is also known for starting the Dakshana Foundation in 2005, which tutors and assists children from underprivileged economic backgrounds to attend prestigious institutions like the IITs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## [[Mohnish Pabrais Free Lunch Portfolio | The Free Lunch Portfolio]]

The concept of the [[Mohnish Pabrais Free Lunch Portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] originated from an article [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]] co-wrote for Forbes in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This article outlined a strategy of "shameless cloning" â€“ replicating the actions of successful investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States mandates that individuals and entities with at least $100 million invested in U.S. equity markets disclose their holdings quarterly, providing publicly accessible information for this cloning strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

A copycat portfolio based on this cloning strategy yielded an annualized return of 15.5% over a 17-year period, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 4.8% return during the same period, resulting in an alpha of 10.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This impressive performance prompted [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]] to establish his own [[Mohnish Pabrais Free Lunch Portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

The [[Mohnish Pabrais Free Lunch Portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] typically consists of 15 stocks, divided equally among three distinct categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>:

1.  Spawners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>
2.  Shameless Cloners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>
3.  Uber Cannibals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>

While this portfolio is not identical to [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]]'s personal holdings, it largely reflects his [[mohnish_pabrai_investment_strategy | investment philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. It serves as an experimental portfolio designed to enhance [[investment strategies for wealth creation | stock selection]] for long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### 1. Spawners

Spawners are companies with "incubation in their DNA," meaning they can effectively assemble capital, infrastructure, personnel, and project plans to launch new businesses with the potential to become multi-billion dollar entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. They typically operate with a "Cash Cow" business that generates substantial revenue, which is then aggressively reinvested into other ventures that may not be directly related but can fuel future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

Examples of Spawners include:
*   **Alphabet (Google)**: Started as a search engine and expanded into numerous billion-dollar businesses like YouTube, Nest, Fitbit, Boston Dynamics, Android, Maps, and Waze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Its advertising revenue serves as the Cash Cow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Disney**: Encompasses film studios, theme parks, toys, Pixar, and OTT channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Amazon**: Includes amazon.com, Prime, games, Whole Foods, AWS, Kindle, and its logistics business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

For 2023, [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]]'s Spawner list includes:
*   DAV Airports (operates 15 airports in 8 countries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>
*   Restaurant Brands (28,000 restaurants in over 100 countries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>
*   Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>
*   Microsoft (catching up in spawning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>
*   Brookfield Corporation (spun off asset management, owns real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, private equity assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>
Notably, Berkshire Hathaway was part of the Spawner portfolio until last year but has been excluded for the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

### 2. Shameless Cloners

[[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Mohnish Pabrai]] openly refers to himself as a "shameless cloner," having invested in companies that Berkshire Hathaway was buying and even emulating the Buffett partnership structure when launching his own investment funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This strategy involves identifying value-oriented investors with decades of experience and expertise in specific sectors, then reviewing their 13F filings (public disclosures of holdings) to copy their high-conviction bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

Key investors [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]] looks to for cloning include:
*   [[Warren Buffett]] and [[Charlie Munger]] from Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>
*   Bill Ackman from Pershing Square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>
*   Eddie Lampert from ESL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>
*   Guy Spier (runs Marine Fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>
*   David Tepper of Appaloosa Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>
*   Li Lu of Himalaya Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>
*   [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Mohnish Pabrai]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>

The 2023 Shameless Cloners list features:
*   Resource Logistics (Turkish company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>
*   Alphabet (picked by Children's Investment Fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>
*   Chipotle (Pershing Square's high-conviction bet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>
*   Alibaba Holdings (by Appaloosa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>
*   Tencent (Value Partners are bullish on it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>

Notably, three of these five companies are not domiciled in the United States (one Turkish, two Chinese), reflecting low valuations in those regions and providing international diversification to the [[Mohnish Pabrais Free Lunch Portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### 3. Uber Cannibals

Uber Cannibals are companies that consistently buy back their own shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Companies engaging in buybacks typically possess substantial cash reserves, anticipate minimal competition or disruption, and believe their stock is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Share buybacks benefit existing shareholders by reducing the number of outstanding shares, thereby increasing their percentage stake and boosting earnings per share without requiring additional capital investment from the shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

For instance, if a company with 1,000 shares and a 30% investor stake buys back 200 shares, the outstanding shares drop to 800. The investor's stake effectively rises to 37.5%, and if annual profit remains constant at 50,000 rupees, earnings per share jump from 50 rupees to 62.5 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

[[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]]'s [[Mohnish Pabrais Free Lunch Portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] initially identified five such companies:
*   Assured Guaranty (insurance and asset management; shares reduced from 183 million in 2011 to 86 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>
*   Primerica (shares reduced from 72 million to 40 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>
*   Navient (business process solutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>
*   Discover Financial Services (bought back over 40% in the last decade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>
*   Jack in the Box (shares reduced from 31 million in 2017 to 21 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>

These companies are characterized by solid free cash flows, which they deploy to buy back their own shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. Recently, [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]] replaced Navient and Discover Financial Services with eBay and Toll Brothers in his Uber Cannibals list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Performance and Methodology

The [[Mohnish Pabrais Free Lunch Portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] did not perform as expected in its initial years (2018, 2019, 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. However, after [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]] made methodological changes in 2021, its performance began to align more closely with the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]]'s approach, built on value principles like spin-offs, cash flows, and moats, often takes time to materialize and show results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

For those interested in implementing this concept, [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]] recommends equal weighting the stocks. For example, with $15,000 capital, one would invest $1,000 into each of the 15 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. The list of portfolio constituents is dynamic, announced annually, but [[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Pabrai]] allows for flexibility and mid-year changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

### Indian Shameless Cloners

To identify Indian Shameless Cloners, one can utilize resources like "Superstar Shareholder Portfolios" on trendline.com, which lists recent stock purchases and sales by prominent Indian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. Examples include Rare Enterprises buying stake in Raghav Productivity Enhancers and Mukul Agarwal investing in Tall Enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

Other Indian companies known for consistent share buybacks include Nalco, Kaveri Seed, E-Clerx Services, and Quick Heal Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The three components of the [[Mohnish Pabrais Free Lunch Portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]]â€”Spawners, Shameless Cloners, and Uber Cannibalsâ€”each offer a compelling narrative supported by performance numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>. This active [[investment and portfolio growth strategies | stock picking portfolio]] can be further refined by incorporating [[investing patterns and strategies | learnings]] from other [[investment strategies and principles of Ashish Kacholia | investment strategies]], such as identifying coffee can stocks, monopolies, using the magic formula, analyzing cash-rich companies, and conducting sector analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.

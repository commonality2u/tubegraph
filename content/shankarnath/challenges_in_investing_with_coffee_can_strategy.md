Every investment strategy, and by consequence every fund manager, experiences periods of both success and difficulty. For instance, [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | Warren Buffett]] faced criticism in the 1990s for overlooking technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, and Prashant Jain's value investing principles drew criticism in 2018-19 for investments in public sector undertakings (PSUs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Similarly, Saurabh Mukherjea has borne the brunt of criticism for his advocacy of [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This has led to questions about the continued relevance of the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can strategy]], with some wondering if it has become outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Key Challenges Identified

### Valuation Agnosticism
A significant flaw in the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can method]] is its disregard for valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. While high-quality companies that demonstrate stability, growing sales, good profits, high Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), and strong competitive advantages deserve a premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, the valuation trajectory of the Coffee Can Portfolio (CCP) has seen its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio surge from the 22-25 P/E range until FY14 to up to three times that by 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

This valuation increase directly impacted performance. From 2021 onwards, when the CCP's P/E multiple was in the 60s, the portfolio struggled to outperform its benchmark, the Nifty50 index, whose P/E ratio was less than half that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

#### Lesson Learned: P/E Ratio Threshold
A crucial lesson from this period is to avoid or resist allocating a large portion of money to the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can style of investing]] if the portfolio's P/E ratio exceeds 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Over time, [[key_characteristics_of_highquality_businesses_for_coffee_can_investing | CCP stocks]] have become more expensive to acquire, leaving little safety in valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This means there's a fair chance the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can portfolio]] or individual stocks within it may underperform the index, at least in the short to medium term, unless everything performs perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Limitations of Initial Screening Filters
While the initial steps in [[stepbystep_guide_to_building_a_coffee_can_investing_portfolio | building a coffee can portfolio]] involve identifying well-established companies (in business for at least 10 years) that consistently generate a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, this single filter is often insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. For example, some established companies like Britannia and Dabur have shown less impressive sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Even after filtering for a minimum sales growth of 10% over the last decade, further considerations are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Excluding Overpriced and Non-Sustainable Companies
To refine the portfolio, it's advised to avoid very expensive stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Examples of companies that might be excluded due to high valuations compared to historical P/E ratios include:
*   Bat Electronics (P/E of 56 vs. typical 20-30 P/E band) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>
*   Varun Beverages (P/E of 97 vs. typical 50-65 P/E band) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>
*   Polycab and Supreme Industries (P/E has significantly shot up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>
*   Titan and Avenue Supermarts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
*   Dixon Technologies (priced at 190x earnings multiple at the time of recording) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>

Furthermore, to ensure the inclusion of only sustainable companies that can persist for 15-20 years, it's better to select market leaders or top challengers in their respective spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Some exceptions might be excluded due to small size or ongoing legal/regulatory issues, such as Monar (small stockbroker), Banaras Hotels (few properties), or the Britcom Group (legal and regulatory problems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### Understanding Business Growth and Sustainability
A critical part of the process involves reading quarterly earnings transcripts and related materials to understand a company's true growth plans and capital deployment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. For example, while Pi Industries is often labeled an agrochemical business, its earnings transcript reveals that 50% of its inquiries and over a third of new products are in non-agrochemical spaces like electronic chemicals and advanced polymers, and it's building a new pharma business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This deeper understanding is essential to ensure long-term sustainability.

Companies that are capacity-constrained with no operating leverage, making it difficult for their revenues to grow significantly over many years, should be scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. Investors should have a solid reasoning for why they are investing in a particular stock before making a commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

### Avoiding Misinformation
It is important to track the businesses within the portfolio by reading quarterly earnings transcripts, news articles, and research reports, rather than relying on superficial sources like Instagram or YouTube shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_and_lessons_in_investing | challenges]], the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can strategy]] remains relevant and can be a formidable way of creating wealth, particularly when applied to [[small_cap_investing_strategy | mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap]] companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

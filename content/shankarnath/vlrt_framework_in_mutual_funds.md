The VLRT framework is a core component of the [[quant_mutual_fund_investment_strategy | Quant mutual fund investment strategy]], defining how their schemes operate and informing every investment decision [00:02:45].

## Components of the VLRT Framework
The four letters in VLRT stand for the pillars of Quant's investing structure:
*   **V**aluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   **L**iquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   **R**isk Appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>
*   **T**ime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

These distinct variables are used when designing investment portfolios [00:03:04].

## Application in Investment Strategy
Quant mutual fund uses the VLRT framework as part of its predictive analytics, which forms the backbone of its [[quant_mutual_fund_investment_strategy | investing strategy]] [00:04:05]. This multivariate model creates a picture of the future by integrating various factors including valuation, timing, risk appetite, global macro factors, and liquidity behavior [00:04:11].

The primary job of the VLRT framework is to provide signals on how the macro environment is expected to behave in the coming months [00:06:01]. Based on these signals, Quant's team can make informed buy or sell decisions on different sectors and stocks [00:06:10].

> Quant's operating style is data-centric, aiming to eliminate human biases or sentiments that could influence stock and sector selection [00:07:21]. The fund house defines itself as a data analytics firm constantly seeking numbers and signals to predict the future [00:03:37].

## Examples of VLRT in Action
The VLRT models have been instrumental in identifying significant market shifts:

> [!example] COVID-19 Market Response (March 2020)
> When COVID-19 struck, the VLRT framework identified a combination of depressing low global risk appetite and a lifetime high in global liquidity. This scenario was predicted to be a "lethal combination from a bull run perspective," which indeed occurred, leading to significant gains for Quant mutual fund schemes [00:05:26].

> [!example] Bull Run Shift (September-October 2021)
> In late 2021, the VLRT models spotted a market "euphoria," indicating that the easy phase of the bull run was ending. This signal suggested a likely shift in momentum from growth stocks to value stocks [00:05:47].

The VLRT framework, combined with Quant's dynamic and unconstrained investment style, allows the schemes to adapt by changing their approach from value to growth, momentum to coffee can, or large caps to small caps, without emotional attachment to a specific style [00:06:43]. This contributes to their high portfolio turnover ratio [00:08:42].

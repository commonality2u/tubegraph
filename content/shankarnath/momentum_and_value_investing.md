The **Trending Value Strategy** is an investment approach that has demonstrated significant outperformance against broader market indices, achieving returns approximately 10% higher over a 45-year period. This strategy was first introduced by James O'Shaughnessy in his book *What Works on Wall Street* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. O'Shaughnessy's work focuses on identifying successful investment strategies through backtesting and analyzing historical market data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Over 45 years, from January 1964 to December 2009, this strategy delivered an annualized return of 21.19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. To put this into perspective, an initial investment of $10,000 would have grown to over $69 million during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Core Concept: Combining Momentum and Value

The phrase "trending value" itself implies a combination of two distinct investment philosophies: "trending" (or [[momentum_investing_strategy|momentum]]) and "value" (or [[value_and_contrarian_investing|value investing]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The strategy aims to maximize the potential of both [[momentum_investing_strategy|momentum investing]] and [[value_and_contrarian_investing|value investing]] by selecting stocks that are not only undervalued but have also shown strong price [[momentum_investing_strategy|momentum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

O'Shaughnessy's analysis showed that while the broader market index compounded at 11.2% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>:
*   A pure [[value_and_contrarian_investing|value strategy]] (buying only undervalued stocks using his value composite 2 indicator) delivered an annualized return of 17.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   A pure [[momentum_investing_strategy|momentum strategy]] (buying stocks with the best six-month price appreciation) delivered 14.5% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   However, combining [[value_and_contrarian_investing|value]] and [[momentum_investing_strategy|momentum]] in the Trending Value Strategy achieved an average yearly return of 21.2% over the same 45-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This "techno-fundamental" portfolio not only outperforms the index but also surpasses single-factor strategies, with the added benefit of lower volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Constructing a Trending Value Portfolio

The [[construction_of_a_momentum_stocks_portfolio|construction of a momentum stocks portfolio]] under this strategy involves two main steps: calculating a value score and then a momentum score.

### Calculating the Value Score

The value score is derived from six fundamental metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>:
1.  **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Multiple**: Current share price divided by EPS. Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
2.  **Price-to-Book Value (P/B)**: A popular metric for capital-intensive businesses. Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
3.  **Price-to-Cash Flow from Operations (P/CF)**: Helps gauge how the market values a company's cash flow generation. Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
4.  **Price-to-Sales (P/S)**: O'Shaughnessy's preferred metric. Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
5.  **EV to EBITDA**: Assesses a company's overall value (market cap and debt) relative to its earnings. Lower is typically better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
6.  **Dividend Yield**: Companies offering a higher dividend relative to share price are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

#### Methodology for Value Score Calculation

The [[methodology_for_identifying_undervalued_and_high_momentum_stocks|methodology for identifying undervalued and high momentum stocks]] involves several steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>:
1.  **Define the Universe**: Select a broad base of companies, e.g., those with a market capitalization of at least 500 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
2.  **Collect Data**: Gather the six required financial metrics for each company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
3.  **Download to Worksheet**: Export the data for easier handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
4.  **Allocate Deciles**: For each of the six variables, rank all companies and assign a score based on their decile. For instance, companies in the first decile (lowest values for P/E, P/B, etc., or highest for dividend yield) receive 1 point, while those in higher deciles receive progressively higher points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. A lower score indicates a more undervalued company on that specific parameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
5.  **Sum Scores**: Add up the scores across all six metrics for each company to get a cumulative value score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Companies with the lowest cumulative scores are considered the most undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Calculating the Momentum Score

For the [[methodology_for_identifying_undervalued_and_high_momentum_stocks|momentum score]], the goal is to identify companies whose stock prices have performed well over a defined period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The strategy uses a six-month price return, focusing on stocks with the highest appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

#### Portfolio Selection

1.  **Filter by Value**: First, reduce the universe of companies to only those in the top decile based on their combined value scores (i.e., the most undervalued companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. For example, if there are 1,500 companies, the top decile would be the top 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
2.  **Add Momentum**: From this filtered list, extract the six-month share price return for each stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
3.  **Select Top Stocks**: Sort these stocks in descending order by their six-month price return and choose the top 25 (or other chosen number, 25 being optimal for risk-adjusted returns in O'Shaughnessy's study) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. These 25 stocks form the trending value portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

The portfolio is rebalanced annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Observations and Characteristics

*   **Price Movement**: A significant portion of price appreciation in trending value stocks often occurs in short bursts, particularly during periods when [[value_and_contrarian_investing|value stocks]] gain market attention, even if they were dormant for years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This highlights the importance of understanding the prevailing market style (growth or [[value_and_contrarian_investing|value]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Rebalancing**: Annual rebalancing is crucial for maintaining the strategy's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Financial Metrics**: Many of these stocks, while undervalued, might display single-digit Return on Capital (ROC) and sales growth, which is typical for classical [[value_and_contrarian_investing|value investing]]. However, their EPS growth tends to be better, reflecting their cyclical nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Purpose of Momentum**: The [[momentum_investing_strategy|momentum]] component primarily serves to provide assurance that these undervalued stocks are not merely [[value_and_contrarian_investing|value traps]] (i.e., cheap stocks that continue to decline) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Performance in the Indian Context

A study by Capitalmind backtested the [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies|trending value strategy]] on Indian stocks over a 16-year period (2007-2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>:
*   **Market Capitalization**: Approximately 79% of the trades involved companies ranked between 500 and 1,500 in terms of market cap, indicating that the trending value strategy is generally a small-cap strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Returns**: Micro-cap stocks were the biggest winners, where the strategy truly thrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The study delivered a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.6% over 16 years, significantly outperforming the Nifty50's 9.9% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This represents an alpha of over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Volatility**: Unlike O'Shaughnessy's findings, the study in the Indian context revealed an opposite effect on volatility and drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This is justified by the strategy's favouring of small and micro-caps, which are inherently more volatile and prone to higher drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Rolling Returns**: An analysis of rolling returns over a 10-year period showed consistent outperformance of the trending value strategy compared to the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

*   The [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies|trending value strategy]] is primarily a small and micro-cap strategy, which inherently involves higher returns but also higher volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   Expect a predominance of [[value_and_contrarian_investing|value stocks]] within the portfolio, typically trading at lower P/E ratios (e.g., less than 12) and with annual sales exceeding market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   Returns from this strategy often come in "bulk," meaning there might be periods of muted performance followed by sudden, significant spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   This strategy is not suitable for all investors, particularly those focused on [[comparison_of_momentum_and_other_investment_styles|growth stocks]]. It is a high-risk, high-reward approach that demands a high tolerance for volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Despite its characteristics, the [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies|trending value strategy]] has performed well globally and can be a valuable addition to an investor's toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

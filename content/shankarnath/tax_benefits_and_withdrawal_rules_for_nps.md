The National Pension System (NPS) is a voluntary defined contribution pension scheme aimed at helping citizens accumulate money for retirement that can then be converted into a post-retirement monthly payout, commonly known as a pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. NPS offers several benefits to its subscribers, including a low-cost structure, market-linked returns, easy portability, and professional management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Tax Benefits of NPS

NPS is often referred to as a "Triple E" instrument, standing for Exempt-Exempt-Exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   The first "Exempt" means contributions qualify for tax exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   The second "Exempt" refers to the returns earned, as there is no capital gain or wealth tax to be paid on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   The third "Exempt" pertains to the withdrawal of money, although this point has some nuances and different interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

### Tax Deductions for Contributions

Employees can receive a host of tax deductions through NPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>:
*   **Section 80CCD1:** Eligible for a deduction of up to 10% of one's basic salary plus Dearness Allowance (DA), subject to a maximum of 1.5 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Section 80CCD 1B:** An additional tax deduction of up to 50,000 rupees, which is over and above the 1.5 lakh limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Employer Contribution:** If the NPS contribution comes from the employer, the employee is eligible for a tax deduction of up to 10% of salary (basic plus DA). This can go up to 14% if the contribution is made by the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Tax Benefits for Employers

Companies can book the contribution made into employees' NPS accounts as a business cost in their profit and loss statement, providing a tax break for the employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Withdrawal Rules for NPS

The withdrawal rules vary based on the type of account and the timing of the withdrawal.

### [[eligibility_and_account_types_in_nps | Tier 1]] Account Withdrawals

#### Partial Withdrawals
Premature partial withdrawals from a [[eligibility_and_account_types_in_nps | Tier 1]] account are allowed under certain conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>:
*   Can be done only after three years of regular contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   Subscribers cannot withdraw more than 25% of their own contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   Withdrawals are limited to three times during the entire tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   Reasons for withdrawal are limited to specific situations, such as a medical emergency, a child's higher education, a child's marriage, or the construction/purchase of a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   All these partial withdrawals are tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

#### Exit Before Age 60 (Premature Exit)
If a subscriber exits the scheme before attaining 60 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>:
*   20% of the corpus can be withdrawn as a lump sum, which is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   The remaining 80% must be used to purchase an [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. The subsequent payouts from this [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] are taxable as per current income tax rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Exception:** If the total corpus is less than 2.5 lakh rupees, the subscriber can prematurely withdraw the entire corpus, and none of that money needs to go into an [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

#### At Maturity (Age 60)
Upon reaching the age of 60, every NPS subscriber has three options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>:
1.  **Continue NPS with contributions:** The subscriber can keep investing and adding to their NPS corpus until the age of 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Continue NPS without further contributions:** The subscriber can keep the account open until age 75 without making additional contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
3.  **Exit NPS at age 60:**
    *   The subscriber can withdraw 60% of the corpus as a lump sum, which is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
    *   The remaining 40% is used to purchase an [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. The subsequent pension payments received from the [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] are taxable as per the investor's income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
    *   If no exit or deferment request is initiated, it is assumed the subscriber wishes to continue NPS until the age of 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Subscribers can exit NPS anytime during this continuation period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

#### In Case of Subscriber's Death
If the subscriber dies before maturity, the entire corpus withdrawn by the nominee is treated as tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

### [[eligibility_and_account_types_in_nps | Tier 2]] Account Withdrawals
For [[eligibility_and_account_types_in_nps | Tier 2]] withdrawals, there are no limits or conditions similar to those for [[eligibility_and_account_types_in_nps | Tier 1]] accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. However, there is ambiguity regarding how capital gains on [[eligibility_and_account_types_in_nps | Tier 2]] withdrawals should be taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

## Role of Annuities in NPS Withdrawals
An [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] is a financial instrument purchased by paying a lump sum amount, after which an insurance company provides the purchaser and their family a fixed monthly income for a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. In India, [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuities]] are commonly known as pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

The NPS rules mandate that at least 40% of the corpus must be used to buy an [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] from an [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] service provider, which is typically a life insurance company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Once purchased, an [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] becomes a contract, locking in the rate of return for the pension receiving period, offering predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

Popular types of [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuities]] include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>:
*   **Life Annuity:** Provides a fixed monthly payment as long as the annuitant is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Joint Life Last Survivor Annuity:** Pays pension until the death of the annuitant, and then their spouse continues to receive the monthly [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] until their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.
*   **Joint Life with Corpus Return:** Similar to the joint life last survivor, but after both the annuitant and spouse die, the nominee receives the original corpus amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
A retirement plan involves two main parts: the accumulation phase, where NPS requires consistent contributions and asset allocation decisions; and the post-retirement phase, which involves selecting the right [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] plan and provider to receive monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

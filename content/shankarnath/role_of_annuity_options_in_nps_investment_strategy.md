The National Pension System (NPS) has undergone numerous revisions since its inception, including significant changes to its annuity requirements and withdrawal rules for subscribers [00:00:04]. These adjustments aim to provide greater flexibility and improved financial management for retirees.

## Historical and Current Annuity Allocation

Historically, NPS regulations mandated that at least 60% of a subscriber's accumulated corpus had to be allocated to an annuity instrument [00:00:08]. This requirement has since been reduced to 40% [00:00:10], offering subscribers more liquidity upon retirement. Currently, upon retiring, NPS subscribers can withdraw up to 60% of their accumulated funds as a tax-free lump sum, while the remaining 40% must be used to purchase an annuity [00:02:41].

## Systematic Lumpsum Withdrawal (SLW)

While the 40% annuity allocation remains unchanged, a significant new feature, the **Systematic Lumpsum Withdrawal (SLW)**, was introduced, allowing subscribers to manage the remaining 60% portion more flexibly [00:02:52]. Similar to a [[systematic_investment_plans_sips_for_longterm_growth | Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)]] offered by mutual funds, SLW enables subscribers to receive their 60% lump sum on a periodic basis (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually) until the age of 75 [00:03:07]. A key advantage of SLW is that these receipts are understood to be tax-exempt, aligning with Section 10(12A) of the Income Tax Act which exempts lump sum withdrawals of up to 60% from NPS [00:03:26]. This facility helps subscribers manage their post-retirement expenses without having to handle a large lump sum at once, and the remaining corpus continues to grow within the NPS environment [00:04:09].

## Multiple Annuity Options

As of May 2023, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) introduced the option for subscribers to choose multiple annuities if their annuity corpus exceeds 10 lakh Rupees [00:08:15]. For instance, a subscriber can utilize 5 lakh Rupees for each annuity scheme [00:08:24]. This provides greater flexibility, allowing diversification across various annuity providers and enabling subscribers to choose different payout options (e.g., monthly from one scheme and annual from another) to align with their cash requirements [00:08:38].

## Simplified Annuity Proposal Process

To streamline the process of initiating annuity payments, the PFRDA announced in 2022 that NPS subscribers are no longer required to complete a separate proposal form for selecting an annuity [00:09:40]. The NPS exit or withdrawal form now doubles as the annuity proposal form, reducing paperwork and speeding up the issuance of annuity policies by life insurance companies [00:09:51]. This contributes to a better service experience for subscribers [00:10:02].

In addition to simplified forms, the settlement time for various withdrawal requests, including annuity withdrawals, has been reduced [00:10:11]. As of August 2022, NPS intermediaries (CRAs, Pension Funds, Custodians) enhanced their IT capabilities to process withdrawal requests in a T+2 working day settlement cycle, an improvement from the previous T+4 basis [00:10:29]. This significantly expedites the receipt of funds and initiation of annuity payments for subscribers [00:10:40].

These changes reflect the ongoing efforts by the PFRDA to improve the [[tax_benefits_and_withdrawal_rules_for_nps | tax benefits and withdrawal rules for NPS]] and enhance the overall experience of managing retirement funds through the NPS.

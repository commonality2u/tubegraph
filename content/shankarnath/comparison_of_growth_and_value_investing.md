Investment strategies often fall broadly into two categories: [[momentum_and_value_investing | value investing]] and [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | growth investing]]. The [[growth_at_reasonable_price_garp_metrics | Growth at Reasonable Price (GARP)]] approach seeks to combine elements of both to offer a balanced strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a>.

## Value Investing
[[momentum_and_value_investing | Value investing]] is an investment framework focused on identifying companies that are trading below their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. A [[momentum_and_value_investing | value]] investor typically attempts to determine a stock's current worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>.

## Growth Investing
[[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | Growth investing]] concentrates on companies expected to deliver above-average growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>. Unlike [[momentum_and_value_investing | value]] investors, a [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | growth]] investor aims to assess what a stock's value will be in the future, typically 5 to 10 years from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:18">[01:37:18]</a>.

## Blending Strategies: Growth at Reasonable Price (GARP)
[[growth_at_reasonable_price_garp_metrics | GARP]] lies as an investing style between [[momentum_and_value_investing | value]] and [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | growth investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. The focus of [[growth_at_reasonable_price_garp_metrics | GARP]] is not on finding cheap companies, but rather on identifying companies where the [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | growth]] potential is being underpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">[02:08:42]</a>. This approach was popularized by investor Peter Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>.

A key tool in [[growth_at_reasonable_price_garp_metrics | GARP]] investing, as described by Peter Lynch in his book *One Up On Wall Street*, is the Price-to-Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>. The PEG ratio is derived by dividing a company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio by its Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

The PEG ratio helps evaluate a company's valuation in the context of its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:37">[05:31:37]</a>. For example, KPIT Technologies Limited, with a P/E ratio of 71, might seem high in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:05">[05:07:05]</a>. However, when considering its 55% EPS growth over the last four quarters, its PEG ratio approaches 1, which Peter Lynch considered indicative of a fairly valued business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:04">[05:14:04]</a>.

### Interpreting the PEG Ratio
*   **In Isolation**: A PEG ratio lower than one can suggest a business is undervalued based on its earnings forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:37">[05:47:37]</a>.
*   **Relatively**: The PEG ratio can be used to compare different stocks, helping choose between companies based on their valuation and expected growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:23">[05:53:23]</a>.

While Peter Lynch defined a fairly valued business as having a PEG ratio of 1, modern [[growth_at_reasonable_price_garp_metrics | GARP]] investors may consider a stock attractive if its PEG ratio is 2 or less, adapting to current market conditions like a generally low interest rate regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:11">[06:40:11]</a>. When examining the PEG ratio, it's important to account for cyclicity in P/E ratios and to prioritize future [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | growth]] rates over historical ones for EPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

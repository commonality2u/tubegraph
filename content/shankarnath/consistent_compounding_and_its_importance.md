Consistent compounding is a core investment philosophy at Marus Investment Managers, founded by Son Mukharji in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This principle is one of four main recurrent themes that guide Marus's approach to creating long-term wealth for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## What is Consistent Compounding?

The concept of [[What is a consistent compounder | consistent compounding]] can be broken down into two main components: consistency and compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Emphasis on Consistency

Marus prioritizes companies with non-volatile, growing earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This focus on [[importance_of_consistency_in_stock_investment | consistency]] helps Marus achieve specific volatility targets for their portfolios and reduces entry point risk due to a linear growth chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

While identifying such companies is challenging (e.g., only four companies grew revenue by 10% annually for 10 years in one search for "coffee can investing" candidates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, and value investors might prefer "lumpiness" in earnings for potentially higher Internal Rates of Return (IRRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, Marus maintains its preference for steady growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Focus on Compounding Free Cash Flow

While various metrics like sales, profits, EBITDA, or capital expenditure can be compounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, Marus specifically prefers using [[Financial metrics for identifying compounders | free cash flow]] (FCF) as the compounding factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Free cash flow represents the money remaining after all expenses and payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Companies with a high Return on Capital (ROC) typically generate high FCF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. These same companies are often perceived as less risky by investors, leading to a lower Cost of Capital (COC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. For example, a 40% ROC minus a 10% COC would likely result in a FCF compounding rate of around 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Marus actively seeks businesses that can compound their FCF at 25-30% for the next 15 to 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Importance of Consistent Compounding in Wealth Accumulation

The emphasis on [[importance_of_compounding_in_wealth_accumulation | consistent compounding]] is central to Marus's investment strategy.

### Valuation Perspective

Marus asserts that the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio can be a redundant metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Their logic is that if a company can consistently grow its earnings and free cash flow by, for instance, 25% year-on-year, the initial high PE multiple (e.g., 80x or even 100x earnings) becomes less significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Investing in a well-run, low-competition franchise that can sustain 25% FCF compounding for 15 years is expected to yield good returns regardless of a high initial PE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Case Studies

*   **[[case_study_on_asian_paints_as_a_consistent_compounder | Asian Paints]]**: This company is cited as a prime example, having consistently compounded its FCF at a CAGR of 24% for the last 25-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Marus detailed its FCF growth breakdown, showing contributions from sales growth (14% per annum over 15 years), increased operating margins, working capital reduction, tax reductions, and asset turns (4% contribution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Titan**: This stock has compounded annually at 40% since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. By Marus's logic, such performance could even justify a PE of 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Value investors often find these high PE valuations difficult to accept, arguing that predicting cash flows and earnings so far into the future is nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Marus counters this by focusing on established companies with strong brands, large market shares, and physical (less digitally disruptive) business models, while also considering the external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Portfolio Construction and Consistent Compounding

Marus's portfolio construction for its flagship Consistent Compounders Portfolio (CCP), Rising Giants, and Little Champs funds incorporates several layers to identify such businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>:

1.  **Forensic Accounting**: Companies are screened for clean accounting practices using metrics like operating cash flow to operating profits and contingent liabilities as a percentage of net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This layer eliminates about 40% of initial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. [[Qualitative characteristics of compounders | Qualitative factors]] like board composition and related party transactions are also assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
2.  **Capital Allocation**: Inspired by Robert Kirby's coffee can investing principles, this involves identifying companies with double-digit revenue growth for 10 consecutive years and a Return on Capital Employed consistently exceeding the Cost of Capital for the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Marus's data shows portfolios based on these filters often deliver over 20% CAGR with low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
3.  **Competitive Advantage and Management**: The team looks for high barriers to entry, strong pricing power, and investments in new revenue drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The quality and tenure of management, focus on core business, decentralized execution, board independence, and succession planning are also crucial [[Role of management in consistent compounders | management factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

This multi-layered approach, combining [[Financial metrics for identifying compounders | hard metrics]] and [[Qualitative characteristics of compounders | softer qualitative aspects]], narrows down thousands of companies to 20-30 stocks for their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

While Marus's portfolios have gathered significant assets under management, their performance, especially for the CCP, has been "par for the course" or even "comes up short" compared to the Nifty50 TR in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Marus advises that these portfolios are strictly for long-term investors who believe in their underlying methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

The focus on companies gaining market share, generating free cash flow, efficient capital allocation, ethical business practices, quality management, and competitive advantages with high ROC relative to COC, offers valuable insights for any investor building a [[Combination Strategy for Wealth Building | personal investing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The formalization of Marus's investment process helps remove biases and emotional decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

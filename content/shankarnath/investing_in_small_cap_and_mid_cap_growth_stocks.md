The investment portfolio of Dolly Kana, managed by her husband Rajiv Kana, is known for its focus on [[strategies_for_smallcap_and_midcap_stock_selection | small and midcap sector]] growth opportunities [02:27:01]. While the public face is Dolly, Rajiv Kana is the primary force behind the investment decisions [01:29:00].

## Background of Rajiv Kana

Rajiv Kana graduated from IIT Madras in 1968 [01:03:00]. In 1986, he established Quality Milk Foods, which produced "Quality Ice Cream" [01:09:00]. He later sold this business to Hindustan Lever Limited in 1995 [01:13:00]. With the capital from this exit, he began investing in the stock markets in his wife Dolly's name starting in 1996 [01:23:00].

Rajiv Kana was 52 years old when he first entered the stock markets, demonstrating that smart and calculative investing can begin at any age [01:33:00]. He made and learned from mistakes in the beginning [01:43:00]. One notable early success was an investment of ₹5 lakh in Unitech Limited in 2003, which grew to ₹25 crores within three to four years [01:49:00].

The Kanas maintain a low profile, avoiding public appearances, interviews, and media engagements, which adds an element of mystery to their work [02:03:00].

## Investment Philosophy: Growth Opportunities in Small and Mid-Cap Sectors

Dolly Kana's investment philosophy centers on capturing growth opportunities within the [[strategies_for_smallcap_and_midcap_stock_selection | small and midcap sector]] [02:27:01].

### Focus on [[small_cap_investing_strategy | Small Cap Stocks]]

Their portfolio includes a sizable stake in [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap stocks]] such as Neil Kamill, Rain Industries, Aanti Feeds, Pondi Oxides and Chemicals, Monte Carlo Fashion, and Siman Farms [02:34:00]. The Kanas prefer a growth style of investing [02:49:00].

They typically avoid sectors like banking, technology, and government companies [02:52:00]. Instead, their investments are concentrated in textiles, chemicals, rubber, automotive, and manufacturing-based companies, where they often identify undervaluation and mispricing [02:59:00].

### Preference for B2C Companies

The Kanas prioritize companies that deal in products and services they or people generally use in their day-to-day lives [03:10:00]. Examples include:
*   Unitech, stemming from Rajiv Kana's search for a house in Delhi [03:18:00].
*   Mjushi Technopac, discovered while seeking a bottle manufacturer for his food business [03:25:00].
*   Hawkins Cookers, for home cooking appliances [03:29:00].
*   Femare, after observing his daughter use their cosmetic products, which yielded a 10x return [03:36:00].

This preference for [[investing_strategies_in_sme_stocks | small B2C companies]] likely stems from Rajiv Kana's experience running his own business, Quality Foods [03:45:00].

## Key Aspects of Dolly Kana's Strategy

### Exit Strategy

Dolly Kana's investment approach includes a clear strategy for exiting stocks [03:57:00]. She successfully exited IT holdings before the dot-com bubble and Unitech before the global financial crisis [04:01:00]. She is not a "buy and hold" investor and has exited stocks with high allocations when a company's [[performance_and_execution_of_investments_in_small_and_mid_cap_stocks | performance]] dipped or did not meet expectations [04:10:00].

However, mistakes do occur. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kanas exited many positions, fearing lockdowns would damage their portfolio companies [04:26:00]. When the scenario didn't pan out as expected, their delayed re-entry into the market resulted in missed opportunities [04:36:00].

### Information Consumption

The Kanas largely base their investment decisions on publicly available data [04:49:00]. They rarely meet company management or conduct investigations ("scuttlebutt") [04:56:00]. They also do not typically engage in the calculation of intrinsic value [05:05:00]. Instead, decisions are made by making sense of public data, relying on experience, mistakes, and multiple iterations to identify patterns [05:10:00].

## Evolution of Investing Approach

The Kanas continually refine their [[small_cap_investing_strategy | investing framework]] [05:28:00].

### Special Situation Investing

[[tactical_approaches_to_maximize_small_cap_investment_performance | Special situation investing]] is an area that Rajiv Kana favors, as it can yield significant profits in a short period, although such opportunities are rare [05:34:00].

### Beyond Buy and Hold

While not entirely against "buy and hold" investing, Rajiv Kana views it as just one of many available techniques [05:53:00].

### Adoption of Technical Analysis

Despite appearing to lean on fundamental analysis, Rajiv Kana revealed in a recent talk that he monitors the 30-day moving average (DMA) for over 500 stocks in his portfolio every night [06:11:00].
*   If a stock trades above its 30-day moving average, it indicates a positive breakout, prompting an investment [06:31:00].
*   If the price is below its 30 DMA, he considers selling [06:40:00].

This simple filter allows him to exit the market before a calamity and enter when a breakout begins, indicating a shift towards technical analysis rather than solely fundamental analysis [06:46:00].

## Experiment: Replicating the Portfolio

An experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of replicating Dolly Kana's portfolio, specifically by "shamelessly copying" her holdings [07:33:00].

Publicly available data on individual investors' holdings (over 1% stake in a company) became mandatory for disclosure in 2016, making such replication studies possible [07:56:00]. The study focused on 37 companies where Dolly Kana held over a 1% shareholding [08:22:00].

The experiment began with data from June 2021, assuming this was the acquisition quarter [08:48:00]. For instance, Dolly Kana's 2.1% holding in Deepak Spinners in June 2021 (1.46 lakh shares) had an acquisition cost of over ₹3 crore [09:00:00]. The total initial acquisition cost for all 1%+ companies as of June 2021 was ₹319 crores [09:20:00].

Tracking positive and negative share increments across eight quarters (June 2021 to June 2023), the XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return) of this replicated portfolio was a placid 6.4% [09:54:00]. This low return was attributed to the [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | small cap index]] being largely flat for most of the period, barring the last two quarters [10:07:00].

The study noted several limitations:
*   Dividends were ignored [10:18:00].
*   Taxation was not accounted for [10:20:00].
*   Significant assumptions were made regarding share acquisition and cost [10:24:00].
*   Only 1% plus holdings were analyzed, whereas the Kanas have invested in over 500 companies over the years [10:30:00].

## Key Learnings and Investment Metrics

The Kanas' approach to [[basics_of_small_cap_investing | investing]] is characterized by:

*   **Focus on Multibaggers:** A strong emphasis on finding multibagger opportunities rather than chasing an index fund or diversified mutual fund [11:22:00]. They believe these opportunities primarily reside in the [[small_cap_and_micro_cap_strategies | small and micro cap space]], where the bulk of their portfolio is concentrated [11:33:00].
*   **Risk Management through Diversification:** Despite sectoral preferences, their portfolio incorporates an inherent risk management through diversification across industries [11:41:00].
*   **In-depth Research and Fundamental Analysis:** Their [[small_cap_investing_strategy | investing]] is based on in-depth research and fundamental analysis, with a high emphasis on growth and profitability [11:50:00].
    *   **Target Metrics:** They generally target companies with:
        *   Sales growth of at least 15% [12:02:00].
        *   Profit growth of at least 20% [12:06:00].
        *   Minimum Return on Capital (ROC) of 15% [12:08:00].
        *   Promoter shareholding often above 50% [12:11:00].
        *   Interest coverage ratio of at least four [12:16:00].
        *   Price to Sales ratio less than one in many cases [12:20:00].
*   **Active Portfolio Management:** Dolly Kana regularly reviews and adjusts her portfolio holdings based on changing market conditions and new investment opportunities [12:28:00].
*   **Continuous Improvement:** The Kanas continually refine their [[small_cap_investing_strategy | investing approach]] by adding filters like the daily moving average and special situations to their repertoire [12:38:00].

Dolly Kana's approach is considered a blend of analysis, continuous improvement, operating within a circle of competence, and patience [12:48:00]. The fact that Rajiv Kana began his investing journey at the age of 52 is seen as inspirational [12:55:00].

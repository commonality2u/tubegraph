A common question in investing is how to construct a portfolio if limited to a minimal number of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Given the multitude of categories, capitalizations, and investing styles, selecting just two funds presents a unique challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. After researching various parameters such as returns, volatility, and drawdowns, a surprising combination emerged as the most comfortable choice for a two-fund portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Chosen Two: Momentum and Value Funds

The ideal two-fund portfolio consists of a **momentum fund** and a **value fund** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This "odd combination" was chosen over more conventional pairings like Nifty 50 and Nifty Mid Cap funds or NASDAQ 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Understanding Momentum

Momentum in investing refers to the tendency for investments to exhibit persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This means that investments that have performed relatively well tend to continue performing well for some time, and similarly, those that have performed poorly tend to continue performing poorly, at least in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This concept can seem counterintuitive to the conventional belief of "buy low, sell high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Understanding Value

Value investing, on the other hand, focuses on identifying investments that are priced significantly lower than their true worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The "value factor" identifies this gap between the current market price and the intrinsic worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Key Characteristics and Benefits

Both momentum and value strategies are based on market anomalies, occurring when investors either over- or under-react to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It's recognized that neither strategy works consistently all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Despite different investor profiles—value investors focus on long-term research, while momentum investors look for short-term price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>—the crucial characteristic that makes them suitable for a two-fund portfolio is their **negative correlation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This negative correlation is rare in equities and allows the portfolio to achieve objectives related to returns, [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | asset allocation]], and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Performance Analysis: Momentum and Value Indices

A study analyzing data from 2006 onwards used two representative indices:
*   The Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   The Nifty 500 Value 50 Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Over 17 years, both indices performed well independently, with the momentum strategy leading in lump sum and SIP performance, as well as lower volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. However, research suggests that a combination of momentum and value can yield even better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### 50/50 Combination

A portfolio with 50% in the momentum index and 50% in the value index showed a respectable 17-year CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 16.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This performance was higher than more popular indices like the Nifty 50, Mid Cap 150, and Micro Cap 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

#### Impact of Rebalancing

Applying annual rebalancing to the 50/50 combination slightly improved returns by 0.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Six-month rebalancing further boosted the CAGR to 16.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. However, due to higher short-term capital gains tax rates, the post-tax returns across all rebalancing frequencies (no rebalancing, annual, six-month) were expected to be similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Analysis of rolling returns indicates that this strategy could consistently offer 15% to 16% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The portfolio benefits from strong performance and an inbuilt [[asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation]] due to the opposing nature of the two strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Yearly performance data clearly shows that momentum and value indices are "not cut from the same cloth," with performance differences of at least 15% in many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Advanced Switching Methods

Beyond a static 50/50 split, dynamic [[dynamic_and_tactical_asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation strategies]] can leverage the cyclical nature of momentum and value performance.

### Momentum-Based Switch Method

This method involves switching the entire portfolio between momentum and value based on the momentum index's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   If the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index rises by 20% over a three-month period, the portfolio switches entirely to the momentum index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   Conversely, a 20% drop in the index over a three-month period prompts a switch to the value strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Over a 17-year period, this strategy required only four switches, primarily due to the specific use of the momentum index for triggering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This momentum-based switching strategy yielded an impressive 17-year CAGR of 22.2%, which is 6% higher than the static 50/50 combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### P-Ratio Based Switching Method

This approach uses the Nifty 50 Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio as a trigger for switching between strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   If the Nifty 50 P/E ratio drops below 18, the strategy switches to momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   When the ratio crosses 24, the strategy becomes more value-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

While promising, this method resulted in a 17-year CAGR of 15.1%, which, though respectable, did not outperform the momentum-based switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

A portfolio combining momentum and value funds is well-suited for a two-fund investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   Both factors demonstrate high performance in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   Their weak correlation provides an inherent [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | asset allocation]] element, diversifying the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   Strategic rebalancing or switching methods can further enhance portfolio performance without significantly increasing volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

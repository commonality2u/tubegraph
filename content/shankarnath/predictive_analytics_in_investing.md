Quant mutual fund's success is attributed to its unique investment strategy, which is deeply rooted in [[Predictive analytics in investing | predictive analytics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The fund house defines itself not merely as an asset management company, but as a data analytics firm that constantly seeks numbers and signals to forecast future market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This approach aims to minimize human biases and sentiments in stock and sector selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## The VLRT Framework

At the core of Quant mutual fund's operations is the VLRT framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This framework's four pillars guide every investment decision and modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>:
*   **V**aluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   **L**iquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   **R**isk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>
*   **T**ime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

The fund house utilizes distinct variables to design its [[methods_for_analyzing_and_managing_stock_portfolios | investment portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, combining qualitative, quantitative, and behavioral aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Multivariate Models

Sandeep Tandon, Quant's founder and CIO, frequently uses the term "predictive analytics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, a concept popularized by Jim Simmons and his hedge fund Renaissance Technologies (Rent Tech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This approach forms the backbone of Quant's [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, constructing a future outlook based on a multivariate model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This model incorporates valuation, timing, risk appetite, global macro factors, and liquidity behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Example of a Multivariate Model
To illustrate, consider determining the price of a football club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. While a simple earnings multiplier can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, a deeper multivariate model would recognize that profits depend on factors like:
*   The league the team plays in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
*   Broadcasting rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>
*   Stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>
*   Players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>

Further layers of analysis for players would include variables such as age, fitness, contract length, interest from other clubs, and playing style versus managerial preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This example demonstrates the depth and breadth required for an effective multivariate model to provide acceptable future predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Identifying Market Opportunities

The VLRT models feed signals to the Quant team, indicating how the macro environment is expected to behave in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Based on these signals, the team makes buy or sell calls on different sectors and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

Examples of the model's predictive capabilities include:
*   **March 2020 (COVID-19):** When global [[risk_management_in_investing | risk appetite]] was low and global liquidity was high, the model identified a combination indicating an impending bull run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This led to significant gains for Quant mutual fund schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **September-October 2021:** The VLRT models detected euphoria, signaling the end of the bull run's easy phase and a likely shift in momentum from growth stocks to value stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Dynamic and Unconstrained Investing Style

Quant's [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing style]] is characterized as dynamic and unconstrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Unlike fund managers who adhere strictly to growth or value strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, Quant schemes are willing to change their style from value to growth, momentum to coffee can, or large caps to small caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, without emotional attachment to a particular style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This flexible approach is evident in the Quant active fund, which rarely maintains the same set of companies on a half-yearly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Timing Entry and Exit Points

Quant's dynamic style recognizes that "pure valuation analytics doesn't help because it just gives you an entry point but never gives us the right exit point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The ability to time both entry and exit points is considered the most significant contributor to the outperformance of Quant fund schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Consequently, the "Buy and Hold" strategy does not find favor with the Quant team, as they believe it can underperform, sometimes for prolonged periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Instead, Quant is open to changing strategies if a different approach offers better returns for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

This approach leads to a high portfolio turnover ratio, with many Quant schemes operating at a churn rate over 700% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. While traditionally high turnover is seen negatively due to increased costs and reduced returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, Quant's dynamic style makes portfolio churning an intentional exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This strategy not only aims for better returns but also helps reduce portfolio volatility or [[risk_management_in_investing | risk]] by moving in and out of rising and sliding trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The correlation between portfolio turnover and returns, particularly in the U.S. markets, has diminished due to reduced transaction costs and sophisticated modern [[risk_management_in_investing | risk management]] tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Behavioral Valuation

Quant's [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | investing philosophy]] incorporates behavior into valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. While traditional valuation uses metrics like P/E ratio, Price to Book, and PEG ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, Quant also considers investor sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. For example, even if Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) banks are attractively valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, past negative experiences can make them "untouchable" for many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

Quant identifies inflection points where valuations are low but negative sentiment towards a sector begins to dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Such points often coincide with positive news like GDP growth, credit growth, reduction in NPAs, or increased net interest margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. These inflection points represent periods with low probability of capital loss and high upside opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Understanding when investor behavior is changing is crucial for stocks to be re-rated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Quant's strong weighting in PSU banks in its portfolio reflects this multi-dimensional research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Understanding Macro Plays

Another unique aspect of Quant's approach is its understanding of macro plays â€“ large-scale trends that are often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. For instance, early signs of substantial money moving from the United States into India suggest a potential trend that could position India as a new asset class, similar to what happened with China years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

Quant also analyzes money flows in other territories, asking logical questions like where investments might go if regions like Europe are less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. These discussions are integrated into Quant's [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, transforming a thesis into an actionable plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

Examples of macro plays that Quant is bullish on, particularly from an Indian perspective, include:
*   Manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>
*   Housing demand (especially rural housing in India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>
*   Global Supply Chain exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>
*   Renewable energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>
*   Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>

In summary, Quant mutual fund's success stems from its commitment to data-driven [[Predictive analytics in investing | predictive analytics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, its dynamic [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, its unique application of investor behavior to valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, its focus on identifying significant macro plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, and its embrace of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

Fund managers are often associated with a specific investing style, making it difficult for many, including the speaker, to transition between styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While an initial education in [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | value investing]], which focuses on identifying gaps between value and price and applying a margin of safety, was helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, it also created an "invisible boundary" that hindered exploration of other concepts like technical analysis, growth investing, or algo trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. However, the speaker has developed an interest in [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## What is Momentum in Investing?

In an investing sense, [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] refers to the tendency for investments that have performed well to continue doing so, and similarly, for poorly performing stocks to continue their poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This concept is counter-intuitive to traditional [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | value investing]], which would find it "sacrilegious" to invest in a stock that has already gone up significantly (e.g., 50-60%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Origin and Behavioral Finance Explanation

The study of [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] as an investment strategy began in the 1990s, with researchers like Fama, French, and Jagdish studying its ability to deliver returns often higher than market cap or [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | value style funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. One explanation for this anomaly comes from behavioral finance, suggesting that investors tend to overreact or underreact to information, causing stock prices to shoot up or depress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These distortions tend to reduce over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This is why [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum investing]] is often viewed as a short-term strategy, typically played out over a 3 to 6-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## [[construction_of_a_momentum_stocks_portfolio | Building a Simple Momentum Stocks Portfolio]]

Because most [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum strategies]] are based on stock or index prices, a [[construction_of_a_momentum_stocks_portfolio | portfolio of momentum stocks]] can be built with minimal investing knowledge, primarily requiring a standard screening software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The process involves three steps:
1.  **Define the universe**: Apply a market cap range (e.g., 25,000 to 75,000 crores for midcaps) to screen for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This might yield around 155 stocks across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
2.  **Sort stocks**: Sort the selected stocks in descending order based on their share price return over a 6-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
3.  **Pick top stocks**: Select the top 10 stocks from the sorted list to form the [[construction_of_a_momentum_stocks_portfolio | momentum portfolio]] for the next 3 to 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Performance Analysis

### Recent Performance Example
A test of this strategy using data from August of the previous year showed that a [[construction_of_a_momentum_stocks_portfolio | momentum portfolio]] of 10 stocks delivered a 34% point-to-point return over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This significantly outperformed the Nifty 50 (11%) and the Midcap 150 (26%) over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### [[performance_analysis_of_momentum_vs_value_funds | Yearly Performance of the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index]]
Examining the [[momentum_and_value_index_strategy | Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index]] as a reference, it has generally performed better than the Nifty in most years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Some years were exceptionally profitable for the [[momentum_and_value_index_strategy | momentum 30 index]], including 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2021, and 2023, where it returned 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] had poor performance in years like 2018 and 2023 (note: transcript indicates 2023 as both good and poor; likely referring to different phases or specific periods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Behavior in Different Market Conditions
The [[momentum_and_value_index_strategy | momentum index]] performs well during market uptrends but struggles in flat or bearish markets, sometimes delivering negative returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]], like a snowball, accelerates returns during good market conditions but struggles when markets are range-bound or not doing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Hedge Fund Application
Hedge funds commonly utilize [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] by buying stocks with positive momentum and shorting stocks with negative momentum, aiming to profit in both scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Participating in the [[momentum_and_value_index_strategy | Momentum Opportunity]]

### Indices
In India, two main indices offer [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] exposure:
*   **[[momentum_and_value_index_strategy | Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index]]**: Comprises mostly large-cap stocks (70-75%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index**: Entirely mid-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Both indices have performed exceptionally well, with a 5-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 23% and 32% respectively, significantly outperforming the Nifty 50's 16% over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For example, ₹1 lakh invested in the Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index in January 2019 would have grown to over ₹4 lakh, almost double the Nifty 50's return of ₹2.1 lakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The speaker insists on having a [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] fund SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) in one's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Investment Vehicles
*   **Mutual Funds and ETFs**: Available for both [[momentum_and_value_index_strategy | momentum indices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. When choosing, consider brand preference, expense ratio (not too high or low), and Assets Under Management (AUM) which should ideally be above ₹100 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Actively Managed Funds**: Recently launched active offerings include the Samco Active Momentum Fund and a [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] fund by Quant AMC, both using proprietary models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Small Cases**: Numerous small cases are built around different [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum strategies]] from various research outfits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

| **Expense Ratio**| Lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>                                                 | Much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>                                            |

The speaker emphasizes that everyone should explore [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum investing]] and personally aims to allocate 12-15% of their portfolio to [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] over the coming quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## [[advanced_momentum_strategies_and_techniques | Advanced Momentum Strategies and Techniques]]

Beyond the basic price [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]], several other [[advanced_momentum_strategies_and_techniques | momentum strategies]] exist:

*   **Price [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]**: Investing in stocks with strong recent price performance, assuming continued upward trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Relative Strength [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]**: Comparing an asset's performance to its benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Cross-sectional [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]**: Comparing price movements of two stocks within the same sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Time Series [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]] (Trend Following)**: A technique that involves identifying and following trends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Moving Average [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]**: Utilized by traders and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **52-Week High [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]**: This strategy revolves around the idea that stocks at or near their 52-week highs will continue to perform well in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Stock selection involves screening for 52-week high stocks and applying positive momentum factors like trading volumes, favorable news, or positive earning surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **[[momentum_and_value_investing | Combination of Momentum and Value]]**: This strategy capitalizes on the weak correlation between the [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] and [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | value]] factors in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. An equal 50/50 allocation can potentially achieve around 15% per annum on a 3, 5, 7, or 10-year rolling basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This is recommended for long-term passive investing portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Dual [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]**: Proposed by Gary Antonacci, this strategy combines two types of momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>:
    1.  **Absolute [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]**: Compares a stock's recent price performance to its own historical performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
    2.  **Relative [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]**: Compares a stock's performance to a broader benchmark like a sector or an index (e.g., Nifty 50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    These two scores are combined (e.g., 50% each) to create a dual [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] score, which is then used to rank stocks and construct a portfolio that is rebalanced periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Samco's [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]] fund is noted to work on Dual [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Volatility [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>
*   **Earnings [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>
*   **Fundamental [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>
*   **Smart Beta [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>
*   **Global Macro [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>

[[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum]] as a strategy is expected to remain relevant as it continues to capitalize on market trends and yield significant returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

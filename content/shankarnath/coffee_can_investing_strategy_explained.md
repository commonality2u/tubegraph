The [[Coffee can investing strategy explained | Coffee Can Investing]] approach has faced recent scrutiny, with questions arising about its continued relevance in today's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This article explores the fundamentals of the [[Coffee can investing strategy explained | coffee can strategy]], its historical performance, the [[challenges_in_investing_with_coffee_can_strategy | challenges it faces]], and how it can be adapted for current market conditions.

## What is Coffee Can Investing?

[[Coffee can investing strategy explained | Coffee Can Investing]] is a long-term, generally passive [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | strategy]] that involves investing in 10 to 15 high-quality stocks and holding them for a prolonged period, typically 10 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. It is essentially a "buy and forget" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Due to the nature of the strategy, investors should expect a slightly unbalanced portfolio where a few positions might dominate, and patience is crucial to avoid interfering with the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

The term "coffee can" was coined by Mr. Robert Kirby in the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The [[origins_and_history_of_coffee_can_investing_by_robert_g_kirby | origin story]] involves one of Kirby's deceased clients who had invested in his stock suggestions but never exited any positions, ultimately building a massive portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

In India, the concept was popularized by Saurabh Mukherjea's advocacy and the book "Coffee Can Investing: The low risk road to stupendous wealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Historical Performance and Its Current Relevance

Historically, the Coffee Can Portfolio (CCP) has shown impressive results. For instance, a table from the aforementioned book (Exhibit 6, page 34) indicated that the CCP outperformed the Sensex in all 17 years of examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Furthermore, over a 25-year period, the Sensex exhibited more negative periods compared to CCP constituents like Asian Paints, Marico, HDFC Bank, and Relaxo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This data suggests that [[Coffee can investing strategy explained | coffee can investing]] has historically worked well in many countries, including India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

Despite this track record, the [[Coffee can investing strategy explained | coffee can approach]] is currently facing significant criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Considerations

A major [[challenges_in_investing_with_coffee_can_strategy | flaw]] in the traditional [[Coffee can investing strategy explained | coffee can method]] is its agnosticism or ignorance toward valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. While high-quality companies with stability, growing sales, good profits, high Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), and strong moats deserve a premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, the valuation trajectory of CCPs has significantly increased. The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio for CCPs, which was in the 22-25x range until FY14, jumped up to three times that by 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

This surge in valuation impacted performance, with Ambit's [[professional_portfolio_management_services_offering_coffee_can_investment_strategies | coffee can portfolio]] struggling to beat its benchmark (Nifty50) from 2021 onwards when its P/E multiple was in the 60s, while Nifty50's P/E was less than half of that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

A key lesson from this is to avoid or resist allocating a large chunk of money into the [[Coffee can investing strategy explained | coffee can style of investing]] if the portfolio's P/E ratio is above 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Over time, CCP stocks have become more expensive, leading to almost no safety in valuations and a higher chance of underperforming the index in the short to medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## A Step-by-Step Guide to Building a "Filter Coffee Can" Portfolio

To address these [[challenges_and_considerations_in_implementing_a_coffee_can_investment_strategy | challenges]], a refined "Filter Coffee Can" approach is proposed, involving five steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

### Step 1: Identification of High-Quality, Well-Established Companies
This initial phase involves picking companies that meet two primary criteria:
1.  **Established Presence**: The company must have been in business for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
2.  **High Quality**: The company must have consistently generated a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
    *   *Note for Financial Firms*: For banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), ROCE is not an appropriate metric. Instead, look for a loan book growth of at least 15% and a minimum Return on Equity (ROE) of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

### Step 2: Filtering for Minimum Sales Growth
From the list generated in Step 1, filter for companies that have shown a minimum sales growth of 10% at different points over the last 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. This ensures not only high return efficiency but also consistent, progressive growth in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

### Step 3: Additional Considerations

This step combines several sub-steps to refine the selection of companies:

#### Sub-step 3.1: Valuations
Avoid "really expensive stocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. For the "Filter Coffee Can" portfolio, prefer companies valued at a P/E multiple that is currently lower than its historical three-year P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. This helps exclude companies whose valuations have broken away from their historical bands, such as Bharat Electronics Limited or Varun Beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

#### Sub-step 3.2: Market Leadership
Select only market leaders or prominent challengers (number two or three in their respective industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. This focus ensures sustainable companies that can persist for 15-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

#### Sub-step 3.3: Company Size
Unlike conventional CCPs that often include large-cap blue-chip companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>, the "Filter Coffee Can" approach allows for mid-cap, [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small-cap]], and even micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. There are three types of CCPs based on size:
*   **Conventional Coffee Can Portfolio**: Includes tried and tested large businesses like HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.
*   **Moonshot Coffee Can Portfolio**: Features mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap companies with the expectation that some might be big winners (10x-100x baggers) while others might lead to capital loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   **Blended Coffee Can Portfolio**: A mix of conservative (large-cap) and moonshot (mid/small/micro-cap) companies, aiming for both stability and tactical opportunism without active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

### Step 4: Additional Proof for Growth and Sustainability
To gain deeper understanding of a company's growth and sustainability, it's crucial to read quarterly earnings transcripts and related materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. This helps identify the company's growth plans, how capital is being deployed, and its potential to be a leader or top challenger in its chosen space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. This step aligns with qualitative parameters considered by professional services, such as leverage, management quality, governance standards, competitive advantages, and growth consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.

### Step 5: Investing Principles
The final step outlines the practical aspects of investing in a [[Coffee can investing strategy explained | coffee can portfolio]]:
*   **Number of Companies**: Aim for a small number of high-quality companies, typically between 10 and 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.
*   **Diversity**: Ensure the selected companies are super diversified across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Holding**: Hold companies for an extended period, ideally 10, 15, or even 20 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>. Do not let fear and greed influence decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>.
*   **Averaging Up**: Consider averaging up (buying more shares after the stock has significantly increased) as it can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>.
*   **Track the Business, Not Just Stock Price**: Continuously track the *company* and its *business*, not just its stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. This is best done by reading earnings transcripts, news articles, and research reports, while avoiding unreliable sources like social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

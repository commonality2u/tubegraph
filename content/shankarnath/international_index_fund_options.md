The vast landscape of index funds in India includes options for [[international_and_socially_responsible_index_funds | international indices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Currently, there are approximately 14 international index schemes available for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

## Available Schemes and Their Characteristics
Out of the 14 available international index schemes, roughly half are dedicated to the NASDAQ 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. The remaining seven schemes vary in their structure and focus, making direct comparisons challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Performance Analysis
When examining the performance data for these international index funds, the NASDAQ 100 has historically performed very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

Another interesting, albeit contrary, inclusion is the Hang Seng Tech Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. While its stock price performance has not been strong, it offers more value than the NASDAQ 100 in terms of fundamental metrics like price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. It has been suggested that the Chinese stock market, including the Hang Seng index, might have reached its maximum point of pessimism, presenting potential investment merits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Recommended Combination
A selection of technology-oriented international indices is beneficial because many domestic Indian indices lack significant IT sector participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. A combination including the NASDAQ 100 and potentially the Hang Seng Tech Index could offer balance in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

The term "consistent compounder" is widely used among Indian investors, though it lacks a single, universal definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For some, it signifies a company delivering consistent stock market returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, while for others, it represents the steady generation of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> or sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Mr. Mukarji's perspective is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

A comprehensive definition of [[consistent_compounding_and_its_importance | consistent compounders]] typically incorporates nine variables, combining both [[qualitative_characteristics_of_compounders | qualitative]] and [[financial_metrics_for_identifying_compounders | quantitative parameters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Identifying Consistent Compounders: Quantitative Factors

### 1. Sustainable and High Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
A key [[financial_metrics_for_identifying_compounders | financial parameter]] for identifying [[consistent_compounding_and_its_importance | consistent compounders]] is a sustainable and high Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This is achieved through recurring revenues, high gross margins, and low capital intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Analysis of a portfolio like Marcellus CCP shows consistently high ROCE numbers, excluding financial companies where ROCE is not the appropriate metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

For instance, Nestle India, though reported by screener.in at 138% ROCE, calculated at a more conservative 56% based on FY22 annual reports, still demonstrates a significant uplift in ROCE because operating earnings have more than doubled while capital utilized has not grown at the same pace over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A practical filter for identifying these companies is a minimum of 20% ROCE consistently over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, which often identifies capital-light B2C companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### 2. Steady Revenue and Earnings Growth
[[Consistent compounders]] demonstrate the ability to generate steady revenue and earnings growth over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This growth may not always be spectacular, but it must be reliable and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. For example, leading paint companies in India have tripled sales over 10 years with [[importance_of_consistency_in_stock_investment | consistent]] growth, indicating their businesses are less sensitive to economic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This often implies non-discretionary products or services with strong brand loyalty and repeat purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. A modest topline growth of at least 12% over many years is a desirable criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### 3. Opportunity Size
Companies with long growth runways, enabling them to grow for 20, 30, or 50 years, are prime candidates for [[consistent_compounding_and_its_importance | consistent compounders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This "runway" can be due to a small market share within a large industry (e.g., Indigo within paints) or an expanding industry (e.g., sunrise sectors like Renewables, e-commerce, online learning, and [[investing_in_specialty_chemicals_companies_in_India | Specialty Chemicals]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Estimating a company's or industry's addressable market is crucial and can be done through industry reports, government data, and trade publications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### 4. Profit Growth (EPS) and Operating Margins
Analyzing profits involves both margins and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Earnings Per Share (EPS) is preferred over net profit as it standardizes earnings, simplifies valuation, and accounts for share buybacks and dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. EPS provides a better reflection of shareholder value, as seen when Adani Ports' profits were up but EPS was down due to new share issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

High operating margins are also desirable, reflecting efficiency, sustainability, and business model strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. A consistent growth in EPS of at least 12% and operating margins of at least 12% are key screening criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### 5. Free Cash Flow (FCF)
Free Cash Flow (FCF) represents the cash remaining for management to use internally or distribute to shareholders after covering operating and capital expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Marico Industries is an example of a company that generates substantial FCF by spending minimally on growth and maintenance capital expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

While a high FCF is generally positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, it's not always used as a primary screener metric due to variations across industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, its applicability more to established companies than new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, and the potential for a high FCF to signal complacency rather than aggressive pursuit of growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Nevertheless, a generally [[importance_of_consistency_in_stock_investment | consistent]] growth of 15% in free cash flows is expected from large, high-quality companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### 6. Market Capitalization Filter
To focus research, it's useful to restrict the universe of companies to those with a market capitalization of at least 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, providing a manageable sample size for further analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Identifying Consistent Compounders: Qualitative Factors

### 7. High Quality Franchise
A high-quality franchise is a business with a strong, recognizable brand and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. It possesses sustainable competitive advantages such as unique technology, exclusive rights, loyal customers, or a superior distribution network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Such a business has a strong track record of solid financial performance across various economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, good growth prospects (new markets, geographical expansion, product widening) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, and enduring demand due to its essential or unique nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

It is generally difficult to find such companies in capital-intensive and cyclical industries like utilities, oil and gas, commodities, chemicals, automobiles, or real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. More [[consistent_compounding_and_its_importance | consistent compounders]] are found in capital-light B2C businesses, particularly those producing branded consumer goods (food and beverages, tobacco, household products, cosmetics), pharmaceuticals, media, IT services, and established financial sector companies like banks, NBFCs, and insurance firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### 8. Pricing Power
Pricing power is the ability of a company to increase the price of its product or service without significantly impacting sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. As Warren Buffett noted, pricing power is the most important decision in evaluating a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Companies with strong pricing power possess deep competitive advantages, few or no substitutes, and are often perceived as essential items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Vedant Fashion Limited, despite offering zero discounts, has maintained and increased its margins due to strong brand loyalty, serving as an example of a company with pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### 9. Industry Market Share
When seeking [[consistent_compounding_and_its_importance | consistent compounders]], the company's relative strength within its industry is often more crucial than its market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. [[Consistent compounders]] frequently benefit from high barriers to entry and strong market share in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This dominant position often stems from their intangible assets and continuous innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Companies that dominate their industry have a higher likelihood of sustaining consistent growth over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### 10. Quality Management
[[Role of management in consistent compounders | Quality management]] is a critical, albeit qualitative, factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Investors should look for management teams with character and ability, assessing their discipline, capital allocation thought process, and short-term and long-term focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Regularly tracking quarterly earnings calls, where analysts and shareholders engage with the CEO, CFO, and other senior management members, can provide valuable insights into the quality and capabilities of the leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

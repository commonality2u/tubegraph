Multicap funds are a category of mutual fund schemes that aim to simplify investment decisions by allowing investors to gain exposure across different market capitalizations within a single fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This approach addresses the challenge of confidently predicting which market indices or sectors will perform best in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## What is a Multicap Fund?

To understand multicap funds, it's helpful to first consider flexicap funds. [[comparison_of_multicap_and_flexicap_funds | Flexicap funds]] grant the fund manager the flexibility to allocate any proportion of assets across large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This flexibility, while beneficial, meant there wasn't a dedicated mutual fund category for investors seeking a truly diversified portfolio across market caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

In September 2020, [[SEBI regulations on multicap funds | SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India)]] mandated the creation of a separate multicap fund category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. According to this mandate, every multicap scheme must invest at least 25% of its assets in large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap categories each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Benefits of Multicap Funds

Despite the seemingly restrictive allocation mandate, multicap funds offer several advantages:
*   **Managerial Flexibility** The fund manager still retains flexibility in determining the *overall* allocation beyond the 25% minimums. For example, they can opt for allocations such as 50:25:25, 40:30:30, or 33:33:33 across large, mid, and small caps respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Optimized Stock Selection** Fund managers can select specific stocks within all three market cap segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This ensures that investor capital is deployed into the "best" or "most ideal" companies within each of the three market capitalization buckets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Market Navigation** Multicap funds effectively navigate the dynamic nature of the Indian stock market, offering good control over allocations and helping manage performance and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Performance and Benchmarking

Most multicap funds are actively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Their performance is typically benchmarked against the Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index or the Nifty 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index is considered the more suitable benchmark due to its closer alignment with how a multicap fund is designed, unlike the Nifty 500 which is predominantly large-cap oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Historically, the multicap index has outperformed the Nifty 500 and Nifty 50 across various years on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. When examined on an SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) basis, there has typically been a 1.5% to 2% alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Rolling returns data suggests average and median returns consistently in the 13% range, which is 1% to 1.5% higher than the Nifty 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For longer periods (7, 10, 15 years), multicaps show a strong probability of achieving returns in the 12% to 16% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This demonstrates that investing through multicaps offers a more disciplined approach to investing and can help explain volatility through its middling performance rank (often second or third) compared to other indices in specific years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

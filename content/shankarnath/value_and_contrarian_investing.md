Porinju Veliyath, often referred to as the "small cap Zar," has built his investment philosophy around core principles of value and contrarian investing. His journey, spanning over three decades, showcases a unique approach that deviates from conventional wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Porinju's Investment Philosophy

Porinju Veliyath's firm, Equity Intelligence, states on its website that "all sensible investing is [[value_investing_principles_in_intelligent_investor | value investing]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>. His approach to investing is built on four strong pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>:

1.  **[[value_investing_principles_in_intelligent_investor | Value Investing]]**: Instead of focusing on complicated metrics like intrinsic value, Porinju prioritizes identifying companies with a high margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. He finds this abundance of value primarily in small and micro-cap stocks, believing that growth is imperative for smaller companies, making it easier to pick stocks with deep value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>. His successful picks include Hindware Homes, Tata LXE, CDSL, Raymond, and West Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
2.  **[[contrarian_investing_strategy | Contrarian Investing]]**: Porinju favors companies that possess potential but are currently out of favor in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. His investment philosophy is unconventional; he often does not base his strategy on financial ratios or business cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. He is on record stating, "I feel there's a price for everything. If a company is doing well and has good future prospects, then ethics and corporate governance should not come in the way of your investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
3.  **Investing in Lesser-Known Companies**: A significant portion of his successes stems from investing in high-quality businesses that are not widely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. He invested in companies like Gokul Das Exports and Nika Paper Mills when they were largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. He noted, "I don't buy a lot of great companies with clean balance sheets, honest management and clear business visibility. If you invest in such companies even bank fds would beat your portfolio returns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. He believes the odds of significant returns lie with these small, micro-cap, high-quality, but not-yet-popular growing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
4.  **Diversified Portfolio**: Porinju firmly advocates for a diversified portfolio to reduce risk without significantly altering returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. He also allocates some capital to large-cap blue-chip companies, though not a substantial amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. He does not have a preference for any particular sector or stock type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

Porinju's approach highlights that there isn't a single formula for investing success, and investors should find what works best for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. He achieved significant wealth by looking for "ignored, out of favor hidden gems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Characteristics

An examination of Porinju's current portfolio (companies with 1% or more shareholding) reveals:

*   **Micro-Cap Focus**: All 16 companies are micro-caps, with market caps of 2,000 crores or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Out-of-Favor Stocks**: Many of these stocks have not performed well in recent periods, contrasting with the small-cap index's positive performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Lesser-Known**: None of these companies are considered mainstream, with the majority delivering less than 1,000 crores in annual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.
*   **Quality Metrics**: While diversified, the quality of these businesses, from a Return on Capital (ROC) perspective, isn't always high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

His portfolio selection indicates that he is a "classical value oriented stock picker" who does not necessarily rely on typical investing strategies or screeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

### Case Studies in Contrarian Value

Porinju's stock picks often defy conventional analysis:

*   **RPSG Ventures Limited**: He holds approximately 32 crores in RPSG Ventures, an operating holding company with diverse interests in IT, FMCG, health & wellness, real estate, and sports (including the IPL team Lucknow Super Giants and ATK Mohun Bagan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. Standard metrics like P/E ratio or sales growth might not adequately capture the value of such a complex company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
*   **Singer India**: Despite a P/E ratio of 330, negative sales growth, and four consecutive quarters of negative operating profits, Porinju acquired a 1% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. This decision was likely influenced by a recent change in management, anticipating a turnaround within 12-18 months that could yield significant upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **PG Foils**: Porinju recently picked up a 1% stake in this aluminum foil and packaging company, which is rarely discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. Despite recent operating losses due to lower demand and currency depreciation, the company's low non-current liabilities and significant cash reserves (149 crores) resulted in a mere 88 crore Enterprise Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. At a potential Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) of just 2.9, this acquisition aligns with a [[value_investing_principles_in_intelligent_investor | Benjamin Graham]]-esque "acceptable ripoff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

These examples illustrate that Porinju's stock picks are not easily replicable via screeners, involving distinct variables and often deep-dive discussions with management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Learnings

Like any small and micro-cap focused fund, Porinju's Equity Intelligence has experienced both good and bad periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. The 2018-2019 period was particularly challenging, as most mid and small-cap companies experienced [[mean_reversion_and_contrarian_principles | mean reversion]] from their high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. During this time, his fund saw a normalization of performance after five years of 18%+ returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

Porinju admitted, "in 2018 I got carried away and I have paid a heavy price for that. I had some highly concentrated bets in not so proven companies and that is why 2018 happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

A notable mistake was his aggressive investment in Leel Electricals in 2017, where he held an 8% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. When promoters diverted funds from a business sale to their personal companies, Porinju actively pursued the issue with SEBI, incurring a loss of about 70% in the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.

These experiences, particularly the Leel incident and the 2017-2019 market correction, have refined Porinju's investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. His key learnings include:

*   Avoiding very small and illiquid companies in his PMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.
*   Holding larger businesses like Tata Communications, Raymond, and Hindware, which now constitute 50% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.
*   Emphasizing expansion and advising investors to visualize a company's growth runway over 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.
*   Continually performing risk analysis and monitoring valuations, market sentiments, and future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.
*   Being more watchful of promoter behavior towards minority shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.
*   Cautioning against buying stocks solely because a big investor has done a bulk deal, as the retail investor lacks information on the original purchase price or prior holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.
*   Stressing that casual investing will not work indefinitely and that investors must systematically upgrade their knowledge and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.

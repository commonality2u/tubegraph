Dr. Vijay Malik, a full-time equity investor and teacher, developed a comprehensive "Final Checklist for Buying Stocks" to guide investors. This checklist, detailed on his blog and in workshops, categorizes key factors for stock selection into four main areas: financial metrics, business parameters, valuation-related numbers, and company management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Management Analysis Checklist

When evaluating a company's management, investors should consider several critical aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>:

*   **Promoters and Directors Background Check**
    Investors must conduct a thorough background check on the company's promoters and directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

*   **Succession Plan**
    The company's succession plan should be fair and demonstrate capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

*   **Promoter's Salary vs. Company Profits**
    The promoter's salary should not be disproportionate to the company's profits. If profits are declining, the promoter's salary should not be increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

*   **Project Execution Skills**
    A company should demonstrate a history of good project execution skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

*   **Consistent Dividend Increases**
    Dividends should have consistently increased over time. For example, while Sri Ganesh Remedies did not consistently increase its dividend per share, most other companies on a sample list did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **High Promoter Shareholding**
    A high promoter shareholding is considered positive, ideally at least 51% of the company's shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

*   **Insider Buying**
    There should be evidence of insider buying, meaning the promoter is actively purchasing more shares in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

*   **Low Foreign Institutional Shareholding (FII)**
    According to Dr. Malik, a low foreign institutional shareholding is preferable, ideally less than 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

This [[using_shareholder_information_for_investment_decisions | management analysis]] forms a crucial part of [[improving_stock_and_mutual_fund_selection | improving stock selection]] alongside [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metrics]], [[business_operations_metrics_in_stock_analysis | business operations metrics]], and [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | valuation parameters]] within the broader context of [[investment_strategies_using_stock_screeners | investment strategies using stock screeners]] and [[methods_for_analyzing_and_managing_stock_portfolios | portfolio analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. While the valuation parameter can sometimes be relaxed, the first three categories, including management analysis, are essential for identifying a fundamentally strong company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

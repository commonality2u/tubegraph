[[asset_allocation_strategies | Strategic asset allocation]] is an approach that involves dividing an investment portfolio among different asset classes based on six distinct criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Key Criteria for Strategic Asset Allocation

1.  **Age**
    Generally, younger investors are advised to hold a larger portion of their wealth in equities. As an investor ages, the allocation should shift towards other asset classes such as bonds, real estate, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This contrasts with simpler rules like the [[asset_allocation_using_the_100_minus_age_rule | 100 minus age rule]], which is considered less scientific as it doesn't account for other crucial variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

2.  **Time Horizon**
    Longer investment goals can accommodate riskier assets. Conversely, short-term goals should rely on more stable instruments like fixed deposits or savings accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

3.  **Financial Goals**
    Given that individuals often have multiple financial goals, it is recommended to break down the overall [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation strategy]] into smaller, goal-specific allocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. For example, a long-term retirement goal (e.g., 30 years away) would have a different mix of asset classes than a shorter-term goal like accumulating capital to start a business (e.g., four years away) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

4.  **Number of Dependents & Income Stability**
    The more dependents an investor has, or if their income is inconsistent, the more complex the financial planning process becomes. These factors influence the level of risk that can be prudently taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

5.  **Risk Profile**
    An investor's risk profile is a critical factor, representing their unique perspective and trade-offs concerning risk and return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
    Risk profiles are not innate but are shaped by various circumstances, including:
    *   Current Corpus (wealth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
    *   Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
    *   Number of Dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
    *   Financial Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
    *   Income Stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>

    As an individual's wealth grows (e.g., from 15-20 lakhs to over 50 lakhs, then to a crore), their willingness and ability to take on more risk on incremental money may increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

> These six factors collectively contribute to shaping a strategic [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Benefits

When implemented effectively, [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | strategic asset allocation]] not only improves risk-adjusted returns but also contributes to greater financial peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

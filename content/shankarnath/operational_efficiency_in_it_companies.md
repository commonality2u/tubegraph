Operational efficiency is one of the three major clusters for [[Key metrics for evaluating IT companies | evaluating IT companies]], alongside business aspects and valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Understanding a company's operational efficiency provides insight into its inherent strengths and competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>, offering valuable clues to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>.

Key metrics to consider for [[Business operations metrics in stock analysis | operational efficiency]] in IT companies include:

## Location of Employees (Onsite/Offshore Mix)
The location of employees is a crucial evaluation factor in the internet-connected world, where software work can be done remotely and sent to clients globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Clients often prefer companies with employees stationed in their own country due to ease of coordination within the same time zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. Having employees in foreign offices can improve a company's chances of winning new orders and securing repeat business from existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

For instance, Infosys has 196 offices outside India across 80 markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>, HCL Technologies is present in 52 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>, and Tech Mahindra has over 200 offices globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. However, increasing the number of employees abroad (onsite) also increases costs, impacting the company's profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. Therefore, striking the right balance in the onsite-offshore mix is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

## Manpower Costs
The IT outsourcing business is labor-intensive, with manpower costs accounting for approximately 50% to 55% of total operating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. Decisions like annual raises significantly impact not only employees but also investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. For example, if employee costs increase by 20% due to talent scarcity or attrition, a projected 10% revenue growth could turn into a 15% degrowth in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. Manpower costs are the most critical variable, and investors should track them quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

## Revenue and Profit Per Employee
It is important to understand a company's revenue and profit per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>. For Tier 1 IT companies, an average employee generates about 7.2 lakhs in annual revenue and is paid approximately 3.5 to 3.6 lakhs, which is around 50% of the revenue generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. Investors should look for an upward trend in both revenue and profitability per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.

## Utilization Levels
Utilization level is defined as the percentage of an employee's time spent on productive, billable work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. IT companies often have a "bench" of employees not currently working on projects due to various reasons like lack of new projects, acting as backups, or being in training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. This bench is a necessary evil, but its size should not be too high or too low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.

> [!info] Optimal Utilization Rate
> A utilization rate of around 85% is generally considered good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>. This number can fluctuate based on factors like the number of engineering graduates, project inflow, and technology types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. A high number of non-productive, non-billable employees for extended periods can significantly impact a company's profit and loss statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.

## Attrition Rate
The attrition rate indicates the rate at which employees leave the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. A higher attrition rate is problematic because hiring and training new employees involve significant cost, time, and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>. Moreover, an employee's sudden departure can disrupt project timelines and the quality of deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

For instance, the 2021-2022 period was challenging for HR managers in the IT sector, with attrition levels consistently exceeding 15% and even reaching 20% in many quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. While this has moderated, it is still not at desired levels for IT companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>.

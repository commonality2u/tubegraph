When purchasing a term insurance policy, providing accurate and complete information is paramount. The primary concern from a customer's perspective is whether the claim will be honored, and this largely depends on the forthrightness of the declarations made during the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

## Consequences of Non-Disclosure

Insurance companies conduct thorough investigations, especially during the initial three years of a policy's existence, known as the moratorium period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. Within this period, an insurer can dispute a claim for any matter related to non-disclosure or other issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. After three years, it becomes very challenging for them to dispute a claim unless a case of established fraud can be proven, for which the legal standard is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

Lying or failing to disclose material information can lead to severe repercussions:
*   **Application Rejection**: If medical tests detect inconsistencies (e.g., nicotine in a declared non-smoker), the application can be canceled, and the policy may not be issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Blacklisting**: Information about false declarations is often shared among insurance companies through common bureaus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. A policyholder who has lied once may be blacklisted, potentially preventing them from ever securing a term insurance policy from any insurer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
*   **Policy Cancellation**: Even after a policy is issued, within the three-year moratorium period, insurers can cancel it if they find evidence of non-declaration, such as through social media or other channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>. The premiums paid would be lost, with no scope for dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.
*   **Claim Denial**: In the worst-case scenario, if the policyholder passes away and non-disclosure is discovered during the claim investigation (e.g., undisclosed smoking habits linked to cause of death like lung cancer), the claim can be denied, voiding the policy, and beneficiaries receive no benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.

## Specific Declarations

### Smoking Status
It is crucial to declare smoking habits accurately. If a declared smoker quits later, there is no rebate on premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. Conversely, if a non-smoker starts smoking after buying a policy, the insurer cannot revise premiums upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. Insurers often ask if a person has smoked in the last 12 or 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. Lying about smoking status can be detected through medical tests (nicotine levels) and lead to the severe consequences mentioned above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.

### Pre-existing Conditions
It is essential to disclose all known health conditions, even those not considered significant by the applicant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. For conditions like hypertension or diabetes, a policy will likely be issued, but it will come with a "loading" or extra premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. Only in severe or rare medical conditions might a policy be outright rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. [[specific_issues_related_to_term_insurance_for_smokers_and_preexisting_conditions | Term insurance for those with pre-existing conditions]] has a higher chance of being rejected compared to health insurance because of the significantly larger payouts involved, requiring insurers to be 100% sure of insurability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>.

### Ongoing Health Changes
While there's no explicit mandate to continuously update the insurer about minor health developments after policy issuance, it is considered best practice, especially for serious conditions (e.g., heart surgery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. Providing this information and ensuring the insurer acknowledges it can act as crucial evidence in future disputes, preventing claims from being rejected as "pre-existing conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>.

## Role of Advisors
A trusted advisor plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate declarations and navigating potential disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. They can:
*   Help map out specific expenses and liabilities to determine the appropriate coverage amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   Guide applicants in truthfully answering proposal forms, preventing self-incrimination due to casual language (e.g., "depression") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.
*   Serve as a conduit between the insurance company and the customer/beneficiary during investigations, ensuring empathy and preventing harassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.
*   Use their expertise and leverage (especially for larger entities with many cases) to fight on the customer's behalf if claims are disputed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
*   Coach beneficiaries on how to respond to insurer inquiries truthfully but without inadvertently causing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
*   Assist in getting second opinions on medical tests or in compiling necessary documentation to petition the insurance company for reconsideration of rejected applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.
*   Facilitate communication and acknowledgement of health developments post-issuance to proactively prevent future disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

It is always better to work with a trusted advisor than to attempt to navigate the complexities of claims and disputes alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

*   Be 100% honest in all declarations during the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>.

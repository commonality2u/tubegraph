While [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum investing]] often refers to the basic principle of investing in stocks that have performed well, there are several advanced strategies and techniques that build upon this core idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. These methods refine the approach to capitalize on market trends and potentially yield significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

## Different Momentum Strategies

A variety of [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum strategies]] exist, each with a unique approach to identifying and leveraging market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>:

*   **Price Momentum**
    This foundational strategy involves investing in stocks that have demonstrated strong price performance in the recent past, based on the assumption that their upward trajectory will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Relative Strength Momentum**
    This technique compares an asset's performance against its benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectional Momentum**
    This strategy analyzes the price movement of two stocks within the same sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Time Series Momentum (Trend Following)**
    Another technique that identifies and follows trends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Moving Average Momentum**
    Commonly used by traders and investors, this strategy utilizes moving averages to identify trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **52-Week High Momentum**
    This strategy centers on the belief that stocks reaching or near their 52-week highs will continue to perform well in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Stock selection typically involves identifying 52-week high stocks and then applying positive momentum factors such as trading volumes, favorable news, or positive earning surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Dual Momentum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>
*   **Volatility Momentum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>
*   **Earnings Momentum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>
*   **Fundamental Momentum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>
*   **Smart Beta Momentum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>
*   **Global Macro Momentum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>

## Dual Momentum Strategy

The dual momentum strategy, first introduced by Gary Antonacci in his book of the same name, incorporates two distinct types of momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>:

1.  **Absolute Momentum**: Compares a stock's recent price performance to its own historical performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If a stock like Varun Beverages has a current price of 1346 and a historical price of 652, its absolute momentum score would be 2.06 (1346 / 652) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
2.  **Relative Momentum**: Compares a stock's performance to a broader benchmark, such as its sector or an index like the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If Varun Beverages was up 106% and the Nifty 50 was up 23%, its relative momentum score would be 4.47 (106% / 23%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Conversely, HDFC Bank's -12% compared to Nifty 50's 23% would yield a score of -0.53 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

These two scores are then combined, often with an equal weighting (e.g., 50% each), to derive a "dual momentum score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. For Varun Beverages, this combined score would be 3.26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The final step involves ranking different stocks by their dual momentum scores, selecting the top performers to construct a portfolio, and rebalancing it regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Samco's momentum fund is believed to operate using a dual momentum approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## [[momentum_and_value_investing | Combination of Momentum and Value]]

Another advanced technique involves combining [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]] with value investing principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This strategy leverages the fact that the momentum and value factors, despite both relating to equities, are weakly correlated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. By implementing an equal weighting, such as a 50/50 allocation, investors can potentially achieve annual returns of around 15% over long periods (3, 5, 7, or 10 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This approach is highly recommended for those building a long-term passive investing portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

These advanced techniques allow investors to explore diverse pathways within [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum investing]] to potentially enhance portfolio performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

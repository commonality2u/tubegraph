The Senior Citizen Saving Scheme (SCSS) is a government-backed retirement benefits program specifically designed for individuals aged 60 and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. It is considered a must-have in any retiree's income generation portfolio due to its high interest rates among debt instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Investment Details
*   **Eligibility**: Available to anyone above the age of 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Maximum Investment Limit**: The maximum investment ceiling was recently raised by the Ministry of Finance from 15 lakhs to 30 lakhs rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: Investments can be made through the nearest post office or bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Tenure**: The scheme has a five-year tenure, which can be extended by an additional three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Interest Rate Mechanism
The SCSS offers one of the highest interest rates among all fixed income small saving plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Current Rate**: For the April to June quarter, the annual interest rate is 8.2 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Payout Frequency**: Interest is paid on a quarterly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Market Linked**: The interest rate is market-linked and announced quarterly by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It is set at 100 basis points (one percent) above the yield of a five-year [[investment_in_government_bonds_for_retirees | government of India bond]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Fixed for Tenure**: Once an investor subscribes to the scheme, the prevailing interest rate at the time of subscription is fixed for the entire five-year tenure of the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. For example, investing now secures 8.2 percent per annum for the entire five-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Historical Rate Behavior
While the rate is market-linked, the government has sometimes absorbed hits to maintain rates during periods of dramatically falling bond yields (e.g., 2020 and early 2021) to avoid public outcry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This means the interest rate was kept at 7.4 percent even when the mandate might have suggested a drop to 6.5 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. When yields later recovered, the SCSS rates followed the yield-plus-one-percent mandate, reaching 8.2 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Fixed Deposits
The SCSS is often compared to other options such as bank fixed deposits and [[fixed_deposit_schemes_for_senior_citizens | company or corporate fixed deposits]], as well as the [[post_office_monthly_income_scheme_po_mis | Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. It stands out by offering one of the highest interest rates among debt instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

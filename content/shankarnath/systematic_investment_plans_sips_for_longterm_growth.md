[[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs)]] are highlighted as the "best, safest, and most logical way of investing in equities" for long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. The approach discussed involves investing in a combination of momentum and value indices through SIPs, leveraging their weak correlation and differing performance cycles to smooth out returns and reduce portfolio volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Personal Investment Experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

The speaker has been running two SIPs based on a previously shared "lifetime portfolio" strategy:
*   **Nifty 500 Value 50 Index** - Started December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Fund** - Started April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The momentum fund's NAV (Net Asset Value) started at around 10, rose to over 25 by September 2024, before dropping to 18, and is currently around 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Despite a 28% drop in NAV from September 2024 to March 2025, the overall NAV growth from 10 to 20 over four years represents a 99% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This volatility underscores the need to revisit and revise investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Core Hypothesis and Revisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

The original premise for this strategy was that momentum and value indices are weakly correlated and exhibit significant gaps in annual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This supports the argument that long-term investment in these indices can build a passive, stable, yet powerful portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Revisions to the strategy include:
*   **Extended Timeline** - Data updated until April 25, 2025 (earlier video was until 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Changed Indices** - Now using Nifty 500 Momentum 50 Index and Nifty 500 Value 50 Index, as they represent the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. (Previously Nifty 200 M30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Sourcing Index Data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>

Index values can be sourced from niftyindices.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>:
1.  Navigate to "Reports" -> "Historical Data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
2.  Select "Total Returns Index Value" (TRRI, which is PR + dividend) from the orange drop-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
3.  Choose "Equity" from the next drop-down, select the desired index and dates, then click submit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
4.  Download the daily data as a CSV file and use Excel formulas to extract monthly values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Index Performance Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>

*   **Momentum Index**:
    *   Last 6 months significantly impacted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   Over 5 years (since April 2020, during COVID lows), the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index grew by approximately 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   Over 10 years, trailing returns are around 18%, which is considered a more realistic and acceptable rate for a broad-based momentum index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Value Index**:
    *   Over the long run, value indices have given returns of around 15-16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Rolling Returns**: Momentum indices have generally outperformed value over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## The Case for a Balanced Allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>

While momentum might appear to have better long-term returns, it's crucial to remember that every investment strategy (growth, value, momentum, etc.) experiences ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Therefore, looking at information over a longer period and using a balanced approach is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Instead of going "all in" on momentum, a mix is proposed, such as:
*   **50/50 split** (as in the original video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **2/3 Momentum, 1/3 Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **60/40 or 75/25** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

The benefits of a balanced allocation become clear when examining data on an [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | SIP basis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### SIP Performance Example (10 Years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>

*   **Scenario**: Monthly SIP of ₹10,000 started on April 1, 2015, over 10 years (total investment ₹12 lakhs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Momentum Index**: Accumulated ₹35.6 lakhs as of March 31, 2025, with an annualized return of 19.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Value Index**: Accumulated ₹38 lakhs as of March 31, 2025, with an annualized return of 21.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

This example shows that over a 10-year SIP period, the value index can surprisingly outperform momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This is because monthly investments into the value index during its static period (Jan 2018 to end of 2022) allowed investors to accumulate units at a low NAV. When the value index experienced a significant jump in 2023, these units grew by 300%, generating substantial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Combined 50/50 SIP Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

A 50/50 combination (e.g., ₹5,000 into Nifty 500 Momentum 50 and ₹5,000 into Nifty 500 Value 50) on an [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | SIP]] mode over the past 10 years has yielded an annualized return of 20.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. While the percentage returns might be similar to standalone indices, the combined approach "smoothens that journey" by leveraging the weak correlation and performance gaps between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. For instance, between October 2024 and April 2025, the momentum index was down 25%, while the value index was down 13-14%, showcasing an 11-12% gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Such periods are when [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | SIPs]] help investors grow their absolute portfolio and reduce volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Switch Strategy and Market Timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>

An earlier experimental "switch strategy" involved fully exiting one index and entering the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. However, attempting to time a switch between momentum and value is considered highly confusing and ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Instead of active intervention, an alternative approach is suggested for market conditions:
*   **Pause Momentum SIPs**: When the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio for momentum funds is high (e.g., 24 and above), consider pausing SIPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Avoid Lumpsum Investments**: Definitely do not invest lumpsums when valuations are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Reallocate Funds**: Remaining funds can be moved into value-oriented funds or relatively safer options like liquid money market funds or equity savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Excessive "meddling" is generally not beneficial for long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The balanced approach, combining momentum and value through SIPs, can consistently yield returns of 17-19% over longer periods without active intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

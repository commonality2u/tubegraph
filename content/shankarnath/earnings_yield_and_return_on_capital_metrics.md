From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 
The [[Financial metrics for evaluating stocks | earnings yield]] and [[importance_of_sales_growth_eps_growth_and_return_on_capital_employed_in_stock_performance | return on capital]] (ROC) are two key [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metrics]] central to Joel Greenblatt's "Magic Formula" investing framework, which aims to identify good companies at favorable prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This formula-driven approach provides analytical shortcuts or "heuristics" for stock selection, similar to the "rule of 72" for doubling money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

### Earnings Yield: Quantifying Cheapness

The [[relative_valuation_and_price_earning_multiples | earnings yield]] is a [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation metric]] used by Greenblatt to showcase a company's "cheapness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

*   **Definition**: It is the company's operating earnings as a percentage of its Enterprise Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Operating Earnings (EBIT)**: This can be found in the company's profit and loss statement, generally listed as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Enterprise Value (EV)**: While not directly visible, EV is calculated by taking the company's market capitalization, adding its debt, and subtracting its cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
    *   _Calculation Example (Asian Paints)_: EBIT / (Market Capitalization + Debt - Cash and Bank Balance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. For Asian Paints, this resulted in an earnings yield of 1.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Interpretation**: A higher [[relative_valuation_and_price_earning_multiples | earnings yield]] indicates a cheaper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This metric identifies the investor's potential return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### Return on Capital (ROC): Identifying Good Companies

The [[importance_of_sales_growth_eps_growth_and_return_on_capital_employed_in_stock_performance | Return on Capital]] (ROC) is the second core [[business_operations_metrics_in_stock_analysis | metric]] used by Greenblatt to identify "good" companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

*   **Definition**: It is computed by taking the company's operating earnings (EBIT) and dividing it by the summation of its net fixed assets and net working capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Net Fixed Assets**: This can be represented by the "net block" number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Net Working Capital**: This is the difference between current assets and current liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
    *   _Calculation Example (Asian Paints)_: EBIT / (Net Fixed Assets + Net Working Capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. For Asian Paints, this yielded an ROC of 39.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Interpretation**: A higher [[importance_of_sales_growth_eps_growth_and_return_on_capital_employed_in_stock_performance | Return on Capital]] indicates that the company is using its resources more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. A [[value_of_high_return_on_capital_and_low_cost_of_capital | high ROC]] serves as a proxy for the quality of the business and its operating model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Companies with [[value_of_high_return_on_capital_and_low_cost_of_capital | high ROC]] generally possess a superior brand, a loyal customer base, deliver excellent products and services, and have a strong, sustainable business model with a wide economic moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Combining the Metrics in the Magic Formula

The Magic Formula uses [[relative_valuation_and_price_earning_multiples | earnings yield]] to quantify how cheaply valued a company is and [[importance_of_sales_growth_eps_growth_and_return_on_capital_employed_in_stock_performance | Return on Capital]] to explain the efficiency and quality of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

To apply this strategy, after filtering companies by market capitalization and excluding financial/utility sectors and foreign companies, investors calculate both the [[relative_valuation_and_price_earning_multiples | earnings yield]] (Rule 4) and [[importance_of_sales_growth_eps_growth_and_return_on_capital_employed_in_stock_performance | Return on Capital]] (Rule 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Then, companies are ranked based on their earnings yield and ROC, and these ranks are added together to create a total score (Rule 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Companies with a lower total score are considered better positioned in terms of a combination of cheapness and business quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

### Nuances and Considerations

When [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | evaluating stock market metrics]] like [[relative_valuation_and_price_earning_multiples | earnings yield]] and [[importance_of_sales_growth_eps_growth_and_return_on_capital_employed_in_stock_performance | Return on Capital]], especially using screeners, it's important to be aware of certain nuances:

*   **Cyclical Sectors**: Companies in cyclical sectors might report unusually [[business_operations_metrics_in_stock_analysis | high operating income]] (EBIT) during peak periods, which can inflate their [[relative_valuation_and_price_earning_multiples | earnings yield]] and [[importance_of_sales_growth_eps_growth_and_return_on_capital_employed_in_stock_performance | ROC]] scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. In such cases, using normalized earnings (average earnings over 5-6 years) or omitting these companies altogether is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.
*   **Cash-Rich Companies**: Companies with a high cash balance can skew [[relative_valuation_and_price_earning_multiples | earnings yield]] numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. Since Enterprise Value (the denominator for earnings yield) excludes cash in its calculation, a significant cash balance can lead to an artificially low EV and, consequently, a lopsided (inflated) earnings yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond the Numbers**: It is crucial not to blindly trust a screener's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. The [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | metrics]] should be backed up with a deeper analysis of the company's business model, financial statements, seasonality, promoter integrity, and growth runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

The Magic Formula, with its focus on these two variables, offers a clear strategy for wealth creation in stock markets, being easy to understand, implement, and track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.

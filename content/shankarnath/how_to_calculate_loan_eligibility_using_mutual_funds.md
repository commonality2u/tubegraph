Calculating your loan eligibility against mutual funds (LAMF) involves understanding several key factors, including the type of mutual fund, the lender's policies, and your mutual fund corpus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This process offers a flexible way to access funds without liquidating your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Basic Eligibility Criteria

Generally, anyone over 18 years old with investments in mutual funds can apply for a loan against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, the final disbursement is subject to the loan provider's specific terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Eligibility by Applicant Type

*   **Equity Mutual Funds**: Most loan providers typically allow only individuals to apply for loans against equity mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **[[Debt mutual funds and safety considerations | Debt Mutual Funds]]**: Lenders are more flexible with [[Debt mutual funds and safety considerations | debt funds]], accepting units from individuals, partnerships, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), sole proprietors, and even companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Factors Determining Loan Limit

The amount you're eligible to borrow largely depends on two primary factors:
1.  **The type of mutual fund scheme** you hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
2.  **The lender's internal policies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Loan Limits by Scheme Type

While specific limits may vary between institutions, typical percentages are:
*   **[[Leveraging debt mutual funds and ETFs | Debt Funds]]**: Lenders usually offer a loan limit of up to 80% of the Net Asset Value (NAV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Equity Funds**: The loan limit is generally around 50% of the NAV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Approved Schemes

It's important to note that many banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have a specific list of approved mutual fund schemes against which they will provide a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. For example, some banks only accept schemes where the Asset Management Company (AMC) is registered with CAMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This means certain funds, such as ELSS (tax saver funds), might not be eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Checking Eligibility via Digital Platforms

Digital platforms have significantly simplified the process of checking eligibility and applying for loans against mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. For example, using the Yeno app:
1.  Navigate to the "check eligibility" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
2.  Enter your PAN details and OTPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
3.  The system will quickly display your eligible credit limit, taking into account your mutual fund holdings and the applicable loan percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

This automated process streamlines what could otherwise be a time-consuming offline method involving extensive documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Loan Structure: Credit Limit vs. Actual Withdrawal

A key benefit of [[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | loans against mutual funds]] is the use of a credit limit rather than a lump sum transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   When approved, the lender (bank or NBFC) provides an overdraft or credit limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   You are charged interest **only on the amount you actually withdraw** from this limit, not the entire approved limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   This offers significant flexibility compared to [[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | personal loans]], where interest is typically charged on the entire disbursed amount from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

> For instance, if you have a 1 lakh rupee credit limit but only withdraw 20,000 rupees, interest is calculated solely on that 20,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Impact of Market Fluctuations

Lenders periodically review the fund value and corresponding credit limit, often on a weekly or fortnightly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. If the market experiences a significant crash (e.g., 50-60%), your mutual fund corpus value will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. In such scenarios, if you've already utilized a high percentage of your original limit, you might need to:
*   Immediately repay a portion of the borrowed amount to cover the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   Work out a plan with the lender to bring the credit limit percentage back to an acceptable level (e.g., 100% of the collateral requirement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

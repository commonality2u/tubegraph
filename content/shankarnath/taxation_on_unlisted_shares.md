Investing in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] comes with various considerations, including the tax implications on returns and dividends received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## General Principles of Taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>

Similar to other equity products, investors in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] are subject to taxes on both capital gains from sales and dividends received from the unlisted company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Taxation of Dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>

All dividends received from [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] are added to the investor's total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Consequently, these dividends are taxed according to the investor's applicable income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Taxation of Capital Gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>

Capital gains tax only applies when [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] are sold at a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The specific tax percentage depends on the holding period of the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

*   **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG)**: If [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] are held for more than 24 months, they are categorized as long-term assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Gains from such sales are taxed at 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG)**: If shares are sold before completing 24 months of holding, short-term capital gain rules apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. These gains are taxed according to the investor's income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Tax Benefits and Exemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>

Certain provisions within the Income Tax Act offer potential [[tax_treatment_and_returns_on_reit_investments | tax benefits]] for investors in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]]:

*   **Section 54E and 54GB**: For capital invested in startups under these sections, long-term capital gains up to 50 lakh rupees may be exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Section 54EC and 54F**: These sections allow investors to save tax on long-term capital gains by reinvesting those gains into specified bonds or assets within a defined period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

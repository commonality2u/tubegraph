Achieving significant returns in the stock market, particularly the elusive "100-bagger" status, hinges critically on the investor's patience and long-term commitment. A "100-bagger" is a stock that has multiplied its value by 100 times, a term coined by Peter Lynch in his book *One Up on Wall Street* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While this seems like an extraordinary feat, India has seen many such instances, with some companies like Pi Industries, Kei Industries, and Bajaj Finance even becoming 1,000-baggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Even broader indices like the BSE Sensex and certain mutual funds have achieved 100x growth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The pursuit of at least one 100x investment in an investor's lifetime is a worthwhile goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Long Journey to 100-Bagger Status

Christopher Mayer's book, based on a study of thousands of companies from 1962 to 2014, identified 365 stocks that delivered a 100-fold return on a $1 investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This list included well-known names like Walmart, Coca-Cola, Boeing, IBM, and even Berkshire Hathaway, which saw an 18,000x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

A key finding from Mayer's research emphasizes the role of time:
*   The average time for a company to become a 100-bagger was **26 years**, equating to a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 19.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   While 60 out of 365 companies achieved 100x within 15 years, **more than half reached this milestone between the 16th and 30th year** of their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

This highlights that [[understanding_market_timing_and_longterm_investment | becoming a 100-bagger takes time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. An investor unprepared to hold a stock for a very long time drastically reduces their chances of bagging such a return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## The Patience Gap and Solutions

Data from the US stock market indicates a decreasing average holding period for stocks, dropping from 5 years in the 1970s to just 10 months as of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This suggests a significant "patience gap" among modern investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

One recommended strategy to bridge this gap is [[coffee_can_investing | coffee can investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This strategy involves building a portfolio of 15 high-quality businesses and holding onto those stocks for 20 to 30 years, with the expectation that at least two or three will become "Mega Multi-baggers" and the portfolio will yield more than acceptable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Patience as the Seventh Characteristic

While Christopher Mayer outlines six key characteristics for identifying future 100-baggers (small initial size, long growth runway, high reinvestment rates, strong economic moat, consistent track record, and owner-operator management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, an unwritten seventh characteristic, crucial above all, is **patience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Two Types of Patience

Patience in investing for 100-baggers manifests in two forms:

1.  **The Patience to Hold**: Being the proud owner of a 100-bagger stock demands a strong dose of patience, requiring an investor to persist with a stock or mutual fund for 15, 20, or even 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This is challenging in today's distracting environment, filled with constant news and shiny new objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. The magic word is "inaction" â€“ staying put <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
2.  **The Patience to Find**: The second type of patience involves diligently seeking out the right investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. A proper system of investing ensures that investors don't miss out on potential multi-baggers or prematurely sell excellent businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Mayer advises investors to be "reluctant sellers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

As Phil Fisher wisely states, "If the job has been done correctly when a common stock is purchased... then the time to sell it is almost never" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. To make money in stocks, one needs "the vision to see it, the courage to buy it, and the patience to hold it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

Most investors, while desiring 100-baggers, often settle for smaller gains like doubles or triples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. However, achieving a 100-bagger can remarkably transform one's financial condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, as the saying goes, "you only have to be right once to make it big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. This underscores the profound [[importance_of_consistency_in_stock_investment | importance of consistency]] and the patience to allow good investments to compound over long periods.

Identifying such companies requires diligent research into business fundamentals, industry growth runways, and economic moats, but the potential future rewards far outweigh the initial effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This long-term mindset is a core principle in [[key_principles_of_stock_market_investing | stock market investing]].

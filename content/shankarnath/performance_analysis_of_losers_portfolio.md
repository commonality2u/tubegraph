The [[losers_portfolio_concept | Losers portfolio concept]] involves intentionally investing in stocks that have experienced significant price declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This strategy gains inspiration from an analysis cited by Professor Ashwat Daman in his book *Investment Fables*, which suggests that buying the 35 biggest losers over the previous year and holding them for five years could generate a 30% cumulative excess return over the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

The core idea behind the [[losers_portfolio_concept | Losers portfolio concept]] is based on two principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>:
*   **Mean Reversion**: The belief that if a stock's price is significantly down, it should eventually revert to its long-term average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Contrarian Principles**: Acting against the market sentiment (investing in stocks others avoid) has historically proven profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

## Methodology for Analysis in Indian Stock Market

Given that Professor Daman's original analysis was based on US data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, a 10-year [[performance_analysis_in_indian_stock_market | analysis]] was conducted on the Indian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

The steps involved in this analysis were:
1.  **Compile Information**: Extract a list of companies with a market capitalization over 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This yielded 1,348 companies existing in 2014 and today, acknowledging a survivorship bias due to the exclusion of companies no longer in existence (e.g., acquired, merged, delisted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
2.  **Pull Stock Prices**: Gather the financial year closing price (March 31st) for all 1,348 stocks from 2014 onwards, using Google Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
3.  **Define "Loser"**: A subjective cutoff of a maximum 50% drop in stock price was used to define a "loser" stock, as drops below this threshold might indicate fundamental issues with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Companies like Rajesh Exports and Raj Rayon Industries were excluded due to exceeding this drop, while Primo Chemicals, Best Agrolife, and 197 Delta Corp qualified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
4.  **Portfolio Construction**: Each year, the 35 worst-performing stocks (applying the 50% cap) were selected for a hypothetical investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. For instance, for FY 2015, companies like 63 Moons, Jindal Steel, Lyka Enterprises, and Shree Renuka Sugars were included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. A consistent amount (e.g., 10,000 rupees) was hypothetically invested in each of these 35 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

## Annual Performance Compared to Nifty 500

The [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Portfolio of Losers strategy]] showed varied results year-on-year when compared to the Nifty 500:

*   **FY 2015-2016**: The Losers Portfolio delivered a 55% return, significantly outperforming the Nifty 500's -6.5% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **FY 2016-2017**: The portfolio from March 2016 generated a 51% return, while the Nifty 500 grew by 25.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **FY 2017-2018**: The Losers Portfolio yielded 23% compared to the Nifty 500's 12.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.
*   **FY 2018-2019**: This year saw a downturn for the Losers Portfolio, delivering a negative 9% return, while the Nifty 500 returned 9.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. This underperformance might be linked to drops in mid and small-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>, suggesting the strategy might not perform well during sharp market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   **FY 2019-2020 (COVID Impact)**: The March 2019 portfolio, affected by COVID-19, lost 54% in value, whereas the Nifty 500 lost approximately 27% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This further supported the hypothesis that the [[losers_portfolio_concept | Losers Portfolio]] performs poorly in a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.
*   **FY 2020-2021**: The [[losers_portfolio_concept | Losers Portfolio]] bounced back strongly with a 231% growth, against the Nifty 500's 77% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **FY 2021-2022**: It grew by 9% while the Nifty 500 delivered a negative 1.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
*   **FY 2022-2023**: This year, the Losers Portfolio continued to underperform, yielding a negative 11.8%, while the Nifty 500 returned positive gains of 10.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

Despite annual variability, mathematically, over a 9-year basis, the [[losers_portfolio_concept | Losers Portfolio]] ironically "won the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | performance battle]]" against the broader index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

### Overall Long-Term Performance

If a hypothetical investment of 10,000 rupees was made annually into the top 35 loser stocks from 2015 to 2023, the total staggered investment would be 31.5 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. As of March 31, 2024, the value of this portfolio would have reached 223 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>, resulting in a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of **38.5%** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>. In comparison, the Nifty 50 would have delivered 14.7%, and even one of the best actively managed mutual funds, the Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund, would have delivered 21.5% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

## Key Observations and Considerations

*   **Reliance on Outliers**: The significant performance jumps in the [[losers_portfolio_concept | Losers Portfolio]] are often driven by a few outlier stocks that experience massive gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. For example, Dwarikesh Sugar alone contributed significantly to the FY 2015-2016 portfolio's performance, growing over 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. Similarly, in a previous analysis, removing just four stocks (Orchid Pharma, Best Agrolife, Patanjali Foods, and Raj Rayon Industries) from a 35-stock loser portfolio saw its 5-year CAGR drop from 91% to 31% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of treating it as a "system" and strictly adhering to the rules, rather than selling individual stocks prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
*   **Optimal Holding Period**: Analysis of trailing returns over nine years suggests that the first two to three years are generally the most profitable for loser stocks, with the "bump up" dissipating over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. Therefore, a holding period of one, two, or a maximum of three years is recommended for those experimenting with this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.
*   **Survivorship Bias**: It's crucial to remember that the analysis suffers from survivorship bias, as it only includes companies that are still in existence today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. The exclusion of non-existent loser companies would likely reduce the reported returns, though the exact impact is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

## Implementing the Losers Portfolio Strategy

For investors interested in building their own [[losers_portfolio_concept | Losers Portfolio]], a list of 35 stocks as of May 1, 2024, can be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. While this list provides a starting point, investors can apply additional criteria learned from financial analysis, such as sales growth, EPS growth, PEG ratio, promoter shareholding, interest coverage ratio, and Return on Capital Employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. However, it is advised not to add too many criteria and to treat the portfolio as a systematic methodology with strict adherence to its defined rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

Investing is a game of probabilities, and the [[losers_portfolio_concept | Losers Portfolio]] strategy appears to be a worthy consideration, at least as a small-scale experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.

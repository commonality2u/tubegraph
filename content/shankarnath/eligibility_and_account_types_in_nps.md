The National Pension System (NPS) is a voluntary defined contribution pension scheme initially launched in 2004 for government employees and later extended to all Indian citizens in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Since its inception, the assets under management have grown significantly, reaching almost 9 lakh crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While a substantial portion comes from central and state government employees, approximately 30 lakh subscribers fall under the "all citizen" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Recent statistics indicate that most voluntary subscribers last year were in the 25 to 35 age group, with about 28% being women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## What NPS Is and Isn't

NPS stands for National Pension **System**, not National Pension Scheme, a common misunderstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Despite the prominent use of "pension" in its name, it is not a pension distribution scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Instead, its primary purpose is to help citizens accumulate money for their retirement, which can then be converted into a post-retirement monthly payout, commonly known as a pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

NPS offers several benefits to its subscribers, including a low-cost structure, tax breaks for individuals, market-linked returns, easy portability, and professional management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Eligibility Criteria

Any Indian citizen aged between 18 and 65 years can join the NPS program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This eligibility also extends to Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), although their contributions are subject to regulatory requirements prescribed by the RBI and FEMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

However, certain entities and individuals are **not** eligible to open an NPS account:
*   Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs) or Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   NPS accounts cannot be opened or operated as joint accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   Individuals are not permitted to operate multiple NPS accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>

## How NPS Accounts Operate

The operation of an NPS account is similar to a [[loans_against_mutual_funds_eligibility_and_application_process | mutual fund]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Subscribers open an account, decide their asset allocation (e.g., equities, debt), make systematic contributions, and their portfolio grows over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Upon [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | retirement]], a portion of the money can be withdrawn, and the remainder is used to set up an [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] to provide monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) oversees NPS, with checks and balances involving an NPS trust, a Central Record Keeping Agency (CRA), and a custodian, mirroring the structure of the Indian [[loans_against_mutual_funds_eligibility_and_application_process | mutual fund]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Types of NPS Accounts: Tier 1 and Tier 2

NPS offers two types of accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>:

1.  **Tier 1 Account**: This account is mandatory for all NPS subscribers and is referred to as the pension account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
2.  **Tier 2 Account**: This account is entirely optional and serves as a voluntary savings facility, often called the investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Key differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts include:
*   **Taxation**: Tier 1 accounts receive significant [[tax_benefits_and_withdrawal_rules_for_nps | tax benefits]], whereas Tier 2 [[tax_benefits_and_withdrawal_rules_for_nps | tax benefits]] are generally restricted to government employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: Tier 2 accounts offer greater flexibility, allowing subscribers to withdraw money at any point in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **[[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | Investment Options]]**: NPS allows subscribers to select different [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | investment patterns]] for each account, meaning one could have a debt-focused Tier 1 account and an equity-focused Tier 2 account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Opening an NPS Account

NPS accounts can be opened both physically and online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Offline Mode
To open an NPS account offline, one must visit a Point of Presence (PoP), such as a bank branch or post office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The process involves submitting an account opening form and furnishing Know Your Customer (KYC) documents, including identity and residence proof, a passport-size photograph, and bank and nomination details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

### Online Mode
The online process is faster, allowing an NPS account to be opened in under 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This requires a PAN, Aadhaar, mobile number, and net banking account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Online account opening is available through enps.nstl.com or various other websites and apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

### Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN)
After the initial investment, a 12-digit Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN) is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The PRAN makes the NPS account super portable, allowing subscribers to operate it from anywhere, even if there is a change in city or employment, or if they shift between sectors (e.g., central government to corporate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Initial and Minimum Contributions
An initial minimum contribution is required to open an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>:
*   **Tier 1 Account**: Minimum initial contribution of 500 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Tier 2 Account**: Minimum initial contribution of 1,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

For Tier 1 accounts, a subscriber is expected to invest at least 6,000 rupees per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Failure to meet this minimum contribution will result in the NPS account being frozen, preventing transactions until the minimum contribution and a penalty of 100 rupees per year of non-contribution are paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Online Account Management Services

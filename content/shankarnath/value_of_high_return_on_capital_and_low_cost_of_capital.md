## Understanding the Concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
The value of a high return on capital (ROC) and a low cost of capital (COC) is understood through their relationship in generating free cash flow (FCF) compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Companies with a high ROC typically generate a high free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. For instance, if a company achieves a 40% ROC, it is often perceived as less risky by investors, which in turn leads to a lower cost of capital, perhaps around 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The difference between a 40% ROC and a 10% COC can result in a free cash flow compounding of approximately 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## The Marus Perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>
[[Marus Investment Managers]] seeks businesses that can compound their free cash flow at 25-30% for the next 15 to 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This focus is a core part of their investment strategy, particularly within their emphasis on [[consistent_compounding | consistent compounding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Application in Portfolio Construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>
[[Marus Investment Managers]] incorporates the principle of high ROC and low COC into their portfolio construction process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This approach draws from Robert Kirby's original [[coffee_can_investing_principles | coffee can investing principles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. A key filter involves identifying companies where the [[return_on_capital_employed | return on capital employed]] has consistently exceeded the cost of capital for ten consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Benefits of this Filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>
Data compiled by [[Marus Investment Managers]] indicates that a portfolio constructed using these two filters (double-digit revenue growth and ROC exceeding COC) has historically delivered a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in excess of 20% on most occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This strategy also results in low volatility, similar to a government bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This metric is considered crucial for identifying companies with [[competitive_advantages | competitive advantages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

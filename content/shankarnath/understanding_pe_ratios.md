The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely discussed [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation metric]] used in stock analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. It is calculated by dividing a company's present share price by its past earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. While often used to gauge future returns, this method can be illogical as a company's future earnings, not past ones, determine investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Visible PE of One

A "visible PE of one" occurs when a company's share price is equal to or less than its earnings per share (EPS) over the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. On the Indian Stock Exchange, out of over 4000 companies, a PE of one is a rare phenomenon, with only about 17 companies typically meeting this criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Hidden PE of One

Investor Mohnish Pabrai's concept of a "hidden PE of one" refers to companies that currently have a high PE ratio but are very likely to have future per-share earnings higher than their current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Generally, if one holds a group of stocks with a PE of one, positive outcomes are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

### Identifying Companies with a Hidden PE of One

Identifying companies with a hidden PE of one can be an "excruciatingly difficult and time-consuming exercise" for most decent-sized companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. However, key [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metrics]] and [[factors_affecting_pe_ratios | factors]] can help:

*   **Profit Growth** The primary variable in the quest for finding hidden PE of one companies is profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Companies growing profits by more than 20% (e.g., Avenue Supermarts, Varun Beverages, IRCTC) are more likely to reach a PE of one, even if their current PE ratio is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Starting Point (Low Valuation)** While high growth helps, starting with a low valuation (a low PE ratio) significantly improves a company's chances of achieving a PE of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. For example, a company with a PE of 10 growing at 10% may reach a PE of one faster than a company with a PE of 100 growing at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   **Visibility Timeline** Ideally, investors should look for companies with a "1P visibility" over a maximum of five to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Long-term plans (multi-decade) are less exciting due to potential disruptions like competition, changes in consumer demand, technological advancements, natural calamities, or regulatory changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Company Size** A hidden PE of one might be more visible in mid and small-cap companies rather than large-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

### Challenges in India

When applying these [[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | evaluation methods]] in India, stock screeners often reveal companies with high debt levels, unstable operating margins, or corporate governance issues, making it difficult to find clear PE of one candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Alibaba Group Holdings Limited

Alibaba Group Holdings Limited has shown characteristics of a hidden PE of one, despite significant market valuation drops (around 80% from its peak) and headwinds like geopolitics, President Xi's re-election, China's COVID policy, and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. The company remains highly profitable and trades at low valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

*   **Cash-Adjusted Price:** At a share price of $65, and with a net cash position of $70 billion (approximately $10 per share), Alibaba's cash-adjusted price is $55 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   **Projected Earnings:** Consensus estimates projected an EPS of $7.11 for FY23, resulting in a cash-adjusted PE ratio of 7.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Over the next five years, EPS is projected to grow to $14.29 per share, bringing the PE ratio down to 3.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Earnings (Free Cash Flow):** Earnings can be categorized as:
    *   **Accounting Earnings:** Calculated from a company's profit and loss statement (e.g., EPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Economic Earnings:** Represented by the free cash flow a company generates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
    For Alibaba, free cash flow numbers have consistently averaged 40% higher than its EPS numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. This means a projected FY28 EPS of $14.29 could be reconstructed as a hidden EPS of $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. At a cash-adjusted price of $55, Alibaba's hidden PE based on free cash flow comes to 2.75, moving it much closer to the PE of one target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

## Practical Considerations and Cautions

Finding a PE of one company is an infrequent phenomenon; an investor might be lucky to find such a company only once every three or four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

*   **Cyclical Businesses:** Be cautious with cyclical businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Their PE ratios are volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, and they generally cannot offer visibility beyond one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. In cyclicals, demand-supply dynamics often dictate price more than earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   **Focus Parameters:** When identifying PE of one stocks, focus on direct parameters like sales growth, profit growth, operating margins, and companies with pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   **Turnaround Companies:** Companies that were once strong but are now in trouble, with potential for recovery through capital infusion and talent, can also fit the hidden PE of one profile, though they carry some risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

It is important to look beyond standard screeners and keep an eye out for businesses that can reach a future PE of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

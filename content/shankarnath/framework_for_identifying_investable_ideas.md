This article outlines a framework for [[Investing patterns and strategies | identifying investable ideas]] by "shamelessly cloning" the portfolios of successful investors. This approach aims to create a replicable and profitable [[investment philosophy and strategy | investment strategy]] by leveraging publicly available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Introduction to Shameless Cloning

The concept of "Shameless Cloning" was popularized by Mish Pab, who copied elements of Warren Buffett's partnership structure and often leveraged the high-conviction ideas of other investors to generate profits for himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While many experts offer investment ideas, a structured system for combining them into a clear, replicable, and profitable portfolio has been lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This framework seeks to address that gap, aiming to identify investable ideas from others and package them into a unique, "shamelessly cloned" portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Information Challenge

In today's information-rich environment, discerning trustworthy investment sources from the multitude of online investors is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Many sources offer opinions that are either untruthful or too fluid to be reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Therefore, a key step is to identify genuine investors whose actions can be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Verifiable Data Source: SEBI 1% Shareholding Rule

A crucial source of authentic information comes from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). In 2016, SEBI mandated that all publicly listed companies must disclose the names of shareholders holding more than 1% in that company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This regulation provides a verifiable anchor, allowing investors to "trust but verify" claims made by prominent figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

This 1%+ shareholding pattern serves as a strong indicator of genuine investing intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The data for this cloning study is extracted for free from platforms like Trendline.com, which features over 80 "Superstar shareholder portfolios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

For the purpose of this framework, 10 "Maha investors" (significant investors) were selected based on their sizable capital and holdings in a decent number of stocks where their shareholding exceeded 1% as of December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Collectively, their holdings in 1%+ stocks amounted to over 77,000 crores spread across more than 370 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Methodology for Identifying Investable Ideas

The primary objective is to narrow down the list of 370+ stocks to a more manageable number, ideally around 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. While many variables could be used for filtering, this framework focuses on stocks where the selected "Maha investors" demonstrate their highest conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Defining Conviction

Conviction is defined not by the amount of capital invested, but by the *percentage of shareholding* an investor holds in a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For example, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's holdings, when measured by percentage shareholding, prioritized stocks like Aptech Limited (43%+), Concord Biotech (24%), Star Health (17%), Metro Brands (9.6%), and NCC Limited (13%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This approach was chosen for its authenticity, simplicity, and effectiveness in testing the thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Six-Step Simulation Process

The following steps were used to create and simulate a "shamelessly cloned portfolio":

1.  **Data Extraction**: Extract 1%+ shareholding information from Trendline for the last eight quarters and transfer it to a Google spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
2.  **Code Identification**: Use tools like ChatGPT to obtain BSE and NSE codes for each stock (some manual correction may be needed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
3.  **Price Extraction**: Use Google Finance to extract share prices for approximately 386 stocks across eight quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
4.  **Top Stock Identification**: Identify the top 3-4 stocks per investor using the percentage shareholding method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
5.  **Data Cleanup**: Manually refine the data to understand the original investment entry points and when an investor exited or lost conviction in a stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
6.  **Investment Simulation**: Simulate an investment of 10,000 rupees at each entry point and sell the investment at market price to determine profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Portfolio Performance and Results

A simulation based on this framework involved investing 10,000 rupees in a total of 57 stocks, totaling 570,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Over the last two years, this portfolio would have yielded a profit of 387,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

This translates to an annualized return of **41.4%** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This performance significantly outpaced the Nifty50, which returned 12.5% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Even when compared to the best-performing actively managed small-cap funds, such as the Quant Small Cap Fund (29.9% return), the "shamelessly cloned" portfolio performed exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Important Considerations and Limitations

While the "shamelessly cloned" portfolio shows promising results, it's essential to be aware of several areas that require attention:

*   **Assumptions**: The framework relies on specific assumptions, such as the percentage shareholding method for conviction and selective investor choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Manual Intervention**: Despite using tools like Google Finance and ChatGPT, manual intervention is often needed to correct errors, especially concerning company name changes or stock code assignments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Information Lag**: The shareholding information is disclosed with a 2-3 week delay from the end of the quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. While ignored for broad testing, this delay can be accounted for if precise timing is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Small and Micro Caps**: A significant portion (over 80%) of the filtered stocks were small and micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Investors uncomfortable with the higher volatility associated with smaller companies should exercise caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Losses are Inevitable**: Even with high-conviction bets from top investors, 20 out of 57 stocks (35%) in this simulated portfolio were exited at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This demonstrates that even experienced investors make mistakes, and one should be prepared for a portion of their investments to underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Conclusion

This framework suggests that "shameless cloning" can be a highly effective [[FactorBased Investing | investment strategy]], capable of delivering superior returns with less direct research compared to traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. While mutual funds or small cases built explicitly around this strategy are unlikely to exist due to expense ratio justifications and the optics for fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, the concept of [[developing_small_case_investment_strategies | developing small case investment strategies]] using this framework remains compelling. Further studies could explore alternative selection criteria, different investors, or enhanced tools to refine this replicable, scalable, and profitable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

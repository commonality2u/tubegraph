The term [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | consistent compounder]] is frequently used among Indian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While there isn't a single definition, it can refer to a company that provides consistent stock market returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, steadily generates profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, or shows consistent sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The speaker's personal definition of a [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | compounder]] includes a total of nine variables, combining both [[qualitative_characteristics_of_compounders | qualitative characteristics]] and [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | quantitative parameters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Quantitative Parameters for Identifying Compounders

### 1. Sustainable and High Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
A key [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metric]] for [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | compounders]] is a sustainable and high ROCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This is typically a combination of recurring revenues, high gross margins, and low capital intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Companies from the Marcellus CCP portfolio, such as paint companies, TCS, Page Industries, and Nestle India, demonstrate high and consistent ROCE numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For example, Nestle India's ROCE was calculated at a commendable 56% based on its FY22 annual report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

A practical screening filter for ROCE is a minimum of 20% sustained over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This filter often reveals capital-light B2C companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### 2. Steady Revenue and Earnings Growth
[[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | Compounders]] consistently generate steady revenue and earnings growth over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This growth should be reliable and sustainable, not necessarily spectacular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. For instance, leading paint companies in India have consistently tripled their sales over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, indicating businesses less sensitive to economic fluctuations due to non-discretionary products, strong brand loyalty, and repeat purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. A minimum 12% modest topline growth over many years is a good filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### 3. Opportunity Size
[[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | Compounders]] operate in markets with long growth runways, allowing them to grow for 20, 30, or even 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This "runway" can manifest in two ways:
*   **Small Fish in a Large Pond**: A company with a small market share within a large industry (e.g., Indigo in the paints industry with 2% market share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Increasing Pond Size**: The industry itself is growing rapidly, as seen in sunrise sectors like Renewables, E-commerce, online learning, and [[key_financial_metrics_for_evaluating_specialty_chemicals_companies | Specialty Chemicals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Identifying a [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | consistent compounder]] requires estimating the company's or industry's addressable market, which can be done through industry reports, government data, and trade publications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### 4. Profit Margins and Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth
When evaluating profits, the focus should be on EPS rather than net profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. EPS standardizes earnings for comparison, serves as a useful valuation tool, and accounts for share buybacks and dilution from new share issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A high operating margin is also desirable, reflecting efficiency and a strong business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The criteria for screening are a consistent EPS growth of at least 12% and a consistent operating margin of at least 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### 5. Free Cash Flow (FCF)
Free Cash Flow (FCF) represents the cash remaining for management to use internally or distribute to shareholders after all operating and capital expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. While a high FCF is generally positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, it can be tricky to screen for, as its treatment varies across industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. It's more suitable for established companies than new or growing ones, and a very high FCF could sometimes indicate complacency if growth opportunities are not pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Ideally, a [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | compounder]] would show a 15% and generally consistent growth in free cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### 6. Market Capitalization Filter
To refine the search, focusing research on companies with a market cap of at least 1,000 crores provides a more manageable sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Qualitative Parameters for Identifying Compounders

### 7. High-Quality Franchise
A high-quality franchise is a business with a strong, recognizable brand and a good reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. It possesses sustainable competitive advantages, such as unique technology, exclusive rights, loyal customers, or a superior distribution network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Such businesses have a solid financial track record across economic cycles, good growth prospects, and enduring demand due to their necessary or unique nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

[[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | Compounders]] are less common in capital-intensive and cyclical industries (e.g., utilities, oil and gas, commodities, chemicals, automobiles, real estate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. They are more frequently found in relatively capital-light B2C businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, such as:
*   Branded consumer goods (food and beverages, tobacco, household products, cosmetics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>
*   Pharmaceutical, media, and IT services sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>
*   Financial sector, including established banks, NBFCs, and insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>

### 8. Pricing Power
[[qualitative_characteristics_of_compounders | Pricing power]] is the ability to increase a product or service's price without risking a decline in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. As Warren Buffett stated, it's the single most important decision in evaluating a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Companies with [[qualitative_characteristics_of_compounders | pricing power]] have deep competitive advantages, few or no substitutes, and are often considered essential items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Vedant Fashion Limited is an example of a company that has maintained and increased margins due to brand loyalty, despite offering no discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### 9. Industry Market Share
The relative strength of a company within its industry is crucial for identifying [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | compounders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | Compounders]] often have high barriers to entry and strong market share in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This dominant position is typically a result of their intangible assets and continuous innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Companies that dominate their industry have a higher likelihood of consistent growth over long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### 10. Quality Management
[[role_of_management_in_consistent_compounders | Quality management]] with "character and ability" is a critical factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Investors should examine management based on checklists to understand who is running the business and their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Regularly tracking management through quarterly earnings calls can reveal their quality, discipline, capital allocation thought process, and short-term and long-term focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Example: Asian Paints
Asian Paints Limited serves as a strong example of a company that checks many of these boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>:
*   **Consistent and High ROCE**: A definite "take" for Asian Paints, consistently achieving over 20% ROCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Sales Growth**: Adequately high and consistent sales growth, irrespective of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Sizing**: Despite being a market leader, the domestic paints industry is projected to grow at 11% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Asian Paints also has a broad product portfolio (waterproofing, tools, adhesives, bath fittings, lighting) and international operations, contributing to its growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Profit Margins and EPS Growth**: Operating margins consistently between 16% and 22%, with EPS doubling every 5 years (except for the COVID year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Free Cash Flows**: Asian Paints has historically been a strong FCF generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **High-Quality Franchise**: Ranked among India's top 20 brands, with the widest and strongest distributor base (over 1.5 lakh retail touch points), and enduring demand for its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Pricing Power**: The company has successfully passed on raw material cost increases to consumers and grown its margins, despite the paint industry's reliance on petroleum products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   **Industry Market Share**: As the leader with 53% market share, Asian Paints benefits from economies of scale, leading to lower production costs and higher profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   [[role_of_management_in_consistent_compounders | **Quality Management]]**: The company actively develops managers internally and seeks external talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

## Valuation and Margin of Safety for Compounders
While identifying a [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | compounder]] is important, it doesn't automatically make it a great stock to buy without a proper valuation exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. However, for [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | compounders]], the margin of safety is often less about calculating intrinsic value and more about building confidence that a company's competitive advantages will remain strong or grow stronger over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. This focus on earnings potential can justify high P/E ratios (e.g., 40, 50, or even 80) for companies expected to grow and generate value for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. For instance, Asian Paints maintained a P/E ratio around 60 from 2015 to 2023 but delivered an annualized share price growth of 17% because its sales, cash flows, and profits consistently compounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

This nine-point methodology provides a solid framework for identifying potential [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | compounders]] and building a robust portfolio for wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

When equity markets reach all-time highs, many investors, especially "normal everyday investors," tend to make "ludicrous mistakes" [00:00:10]. These errors often include selling mutual fund units to directly invest in stocks [00:00:16] or dabbling in [[option_trading_strategies | Futures and options]] [00:00:20]. A common pitfall is a sense of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), leading to chasing performance without considering valuations [00:00:25]. Additionally, there's a neglect of risk management strategies, reduced diversification, investment in penny stocks, and excessive confidence in the future [00:00:46].

## Navigating All-Time High Markets
When markets are at their all-time high, there are generally two lines of thought [00:01:03]:
*   **Buy and Hold Approach**: This includes Index Fund buyers who continue to invest [00:01:08].
*   **Traders**: For them, an [[entry_and_exit_strategies_in_investing | in and out strategy]] is a way of life [00:01:18].

For investors in the middle, it's advisable to consider booking profits. This not only helps maximize gains but also aids in reducing [[methods_for_analyzing_and_managing_stock_portfolios | portfolio risk]] and preserving capital [00:01:30].

## Key Profit Booking Strategies

### 1. Avoid the "All or Nothing" Approach
The "All or Nothing" strategy involves selling off every piece of equity one holds when markets are at an all-time high and sitting on cash [00:02:10]. This is generally considered a significant mistake [00:02:16].

> [!NOTE] Why to Avoid "All or Nothing"
> A sizable portion of wealth creation comes from a portfolio's equity allocation [00:02:21]. Even if a large chunk of stock or mutual fund holdings are sold, the cash needs to be redeployed in equities as early as possible [00:02:28]. The stock market tends to rise after a drop in valuations [00:02:39], and the exact timing of a bounce back is unknown [00:02:48].
>
> It is crucial to stick to a minimum equity allocation at all times, such as 50%, 60%, or 70%, based on one's comfort level [00:02:52]. Only the "opportunity part" of the equity portfolio should be churned for tactical calls [00:03:02]. For example, if one's comfort zone is 50% to 70% equity, the 20% difference can be used tactically [00:03:08].
>
> While it's acceptable to exit a particular sector if it's overvalued or facing issues (e.g., policy changes, demand drops, regulations) [00:03:36], an "All or Nothing" strategy for overall equities should be avoided [00:03:52].

### 2. Move Beyond "Free Shares" or Percentage-Based Exits
An outdated concept for profit booking is the "free shares" technique, where if an investment doubles, half the shares are sold to recuperate capital, making the remaining shares "virtually free of cost" [00:04:14].

> [!CAUTION] Limitations of Percentage-Based Strategies
> Relying on percentage appreciation (e.g., selling at 20%, 30%, or 100% profit) is not ideal for long-term investors [00:04:35]. Many stocks, like Titan, have continued to double multiple times [00:04:49]. These strategies are more suitable for short-term traders [00:05:03].

A more effective approach is to pick sell candidates based on **valuation indicators** like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio [00:05:11]. Comparing these ratios within a sector (e.g., cement companies show P/E ratios ranging from 25 to 60) can provide a logical idea of under and overvaluation [00:05:17]. Combining this with other factors such as earnings growth, sales growth, future estimates, and technical indicators (like moving averages and RSI) offers a better understanding of which stocks to sell during market highs [00:05:35].

It is also important to compare the P/E ratio at the time of investment versus the current P/E ratio when considering a sale [00:05:50]. For instance, if a stock like Apollo Tyres was bought at a P/E of 28.1 and is now at 16.6, despite a significant price increase, selling might not be the best decision [00:06:03]. Understanding valuations is more critical than mere percentage price rises, as selling winners might mean letting go of future [[investment_strategies_for_multibagger_stocks | multibaggers]] [00:06:40].

### 3. Sell Low-Conviction Bets
A logical strategy, particularly when markets are high, is to sell your low-conviction bets before your high-conviction ones [00:07:01].
*   **High-Conviction Bets**: These are investments where significant homework, research, and analysis have been done, and the investment thesis still holds [00:07:11].
*   **Low-Conviction Bets**: These are stocks or instruments where little effort was put into understanding the business [00:07:23], bought by simply riding a bull market wave [00:07:28], or acquired based on tips or what "big-name investors" or social media personalities are buying [00:07:34].

If an investor has been fortunate with such stocks, an all-time high market provides an opportunity to sell these low-conviction ideas [00:07:43], retaining instruments where there is better knowledge and conviction in the business and fundamentals [00:07:49].

### 4. Remove Weaker Stocks and Loss-Making Positions
An all-time high market is an excellent opportunity to get rid of fundamentally weaker stocks and even loss-making positions in a portfolio [00:08:00]. While no one buys a stock expecting it to underperform [00:08:09], long-term equity portfolios often accumulate a "long tail" of "dud" stocks, especially in the mid-cap and small-cap segments [00:08:18].

Since "a rising tide lifts all boats" [00:08:31], even these weaker stocks may have risen. This is the moment to push out those fundamentally weak companies or those that have maximized their earnings, indicating their earning cycle is trending downwards [00:08:37].

> [!TIP] Tax Loss Harvesting
> Even if booking losses, the government offers a "discount" on taxes through tax loss harvesting rules [00:08:52]. These rules allow setting off losses against capital gains, helping save on taxes [00:09:00].
>
> Correcting previous investment mistakes is a great benefit of an all-time high market situation [00:09:10].

### 5. Utilize a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)
Many investors use the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) mode for entering the market, which reduces timing risk [00:09:15]. Similarly, it's advisable to use a systematic route during exits, especially if there isn't a specific valuation target [00:09:31]. This is done via a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) [00:09:40].

An SWP allows an investor to sell holdings in a phased manner and in equal lots [00:09:44]. Unlike SIPs, SWPs require defining an exit period [00:09:55]. When markets are at an all-time high, an SWP tenure should ideally not be too long; a six-month tenure is often sufficient [00:10:00].

For example, to reduce an equity allocation from 80% to 65% (a 15 lakh sale), a six-month SWP could involve withdrawing 2.5 lakhs per month from the equity fund into a bank account or a debt/arbitrage fund [00:10:13].

> [!IMPORTANT] Flexibility is Key
> Be ready to cancel the SWP if there's a sudden market fall, as selling at lower valuations should be avoided [00:10:34]. The core point is to avoid panic and never get rid of all positions in one go, which might not maximize profit booking [00:10:43].

### 6. Have a Redeployment Plan
Before selling any stock or mutual fund holdings, always have a redeployment plan for the money received [00:10:52]. Many investors, despite redeeming shares, are guilty of not knowing what to do with the funds [00:11:04].

Here are some suggested redeployment avenues:
*   **Rebalancing**: This is discussed in the next strategy [00:11:19].
*   **Financial Goals**: Use the money for upcoming financial goals like a car down payment or home renovations [00:11:23].
*   **Tactical Redeployment**: Invest tactically into a fixed deposit, arbitrage fund, or short-term debt mutual fund [00:11:34].
*   **Wish List Companies**: Reinvest into a "wish list" of companies one has always wanted to own, assuming these companies are not excessively valued [00:11:47].

### 7. Link Profit Booking to Portfolio Rebalancing
Rebalancing is the fine-tuning of an investment portfolio to align with the original asset allocation plan [00:12:05]. Some investments, like equity, grow faster than others, altering the asset allocation [00:12:21]. Rebalancing helps bring it back to the desired structure [00:12:28].

This involves selling equities when markets are at an all-time high and using that cash to make more investments in non-equity instruments, such as debt [00:12:31]. This not only facilitates profit booking but also improves the portfolio's shape and aligns return expectations with risk tolerance [00:12:44].

In investing terms, rebalancing means divesting from relatively overvalued assets (like equities) and investing that money into undervalued assets [00:12:54]. While it might seem illogical to sell winners and invest in "losers" [00:13:03], numerous studies show that rebalancing improves a long-term investor's risk-adjusted returns [00:13:11]. This averaging technique benefits investors in the long term as markets fluctuate [00:13:19].

By using these strategies, investors can smartly and planfully exit equity markets when at all-time highs [00:13:27].

While the investing world often credits Dolly Khanna, the actual management and strategic decision-making for her portfolio are carried out by her husband, Rajiv Khanna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The fame is associated with Dolly, but the investment strategy is orchestrated by Rajiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Background and Entry into Stock Markets

Rajiv Khanna graduated from IIT Madras in 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. After years of work, he established "Quality Milk Foods" in 1986, which was known for its "Quality Ice Cream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He later sold this business to Hindustan Lever Limited in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

With the capital from this exit, Rajiv Khanna began investing in the stock markets in 1996, using his wife Dolly's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. He was 52 years old when he first entered the stock markets, demonstrating that strategic investing can commence at any age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Like many, he made initial mistakes but crucially learned from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. One of his early successes was Unitech Limited, where an investment of 5 lakh rupees in 2003 grew to 25 crores within three to four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The Khannas maintain a low public profile, typically avoiding interviews and media engagements, which adds an element of mystery to their methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Rajiv Khanna did, however, give a notable talk at his alma mater in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Strategy

Rajiv Khanna's approach, which defines [[dolly_khannas_stock_investment_strategy | Dolly Khanna's stock investment strategy]], has several key pillars:

### Focus on Growth Opportunities
The investment philosophy centers on capturing growth opportunities, particularly within the small and midcap sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The portfolio frequently includes small-cap stocks like Neil Kamill, Rain Industries, Aanti Feeds, Pondi Oxides and Chemicals, Monte Carlo Fashion, and Siman Farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Their preference is for the growth style of investing, favoring sectors like textiles, chemicals, rubber, automotive, and manufacturing-based companies, where they often identify undervaluation and mispricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Investing in Familiar Products/Services
The Khannas prioritize companies that offer products and services they or the general public use in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Examples include:
*   Unitech: Identified when Rajiv Khanna was looking to buy a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   Mjushi Technopac: Discovered while seeking a bottle manufacturer for his food business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   Hawkins Cookers: Relates to common household cooking needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   Femare: Discovered after observing his daughter using their cosmetic products, leading to a 10x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
This preference for small B2C (Business-to-Consumer) companies likely stems from Rajiv Khanna's experience running his own business, Quality Milk Foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Active Portfolio Management and Exit Strategy
A key trait is knowing when to exit a stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Notable exits include IT holdings before the dot-com bubble and Unitech before the global financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Rajiv Khanna is not a rigid buy-and-hold investor and has exited stocks with high allocations when a company's performance dipped or didn't meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, mistakes occur; for instance, during COVID-19, positions were exited due to concerns about lockdowns, and they were slow to re-enter the market when the scenario didn't pan out as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Reliance on Public Data
The investment strategy heavily relies on publicly available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The Khannas rarely meet company management, conduct investigations ("scuttlebutt"), or calculate intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Investment decisions are almost entirely based on making sense of public information, with experience aiding in pattern recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Evolving Strategies and Mental Models
Over time, newer strategies have been incorporated:
*   **Special Situation Investing**: This area is favored by Rajiv Khanna, as it can generate significant returns in a short period, although such opportunities are rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Challenging Buy and Hold**: While not entirely against buy-and-hold, he views it as just one of many available investment techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Technical Analysis Integration**: Despite leaning towards fundamental analysis, Rajiv Khanna's current strategy involves checking the 30-day moving average (DMA) of his portfolio's 500+ stocks nightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. If a stock trades above its 30-day moving average, it indicates a positive breakout prompting investment; if below, it signals a potential sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This simple filter helps him exit before calamities and enter during breakouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Portfolio Characteristics

Rajiv Khanna's management of the portfolio reflects:
*   **Multibagger Focus**: A strong emphasis on identifying multibagger opportunities rather than relying on index or diversified mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Small and Micro Cap Dominance**: The majority of the portfolio is concentrated in the small and micro cap space, where they believe multibaggers are found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Risk Management through Diversification**: Despite sectoral preferences, there's an in-built risk management through [[importance_of_diversified_portfolio | diversification]] across industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Fundamental Analysis with Growth Emphasis**: Investments are based on in-depth research and fundamental analysis, with a high emphasis on growth and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. They target:
    *   Sales growth: At least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
    *   Profit growth: At least 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
    *   Return on Capital (ROC): Minimum 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
    *   Promoter shareholding: Often above 50% in investee companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
    *   Interest coverage ratio: Always comfortable, at least four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
    *   Price to sales ratio: Less than one in many cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Active Portfolio Management**: The portfolio holdings are regularly reviewed and adjusted based on changing market conditions and new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: The Khannas continuously refine their investment approach by incorporating new filters, such as the daily moving average and special situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

Rajiv Khanna's investment approach is described as a blend of analysis, continuous improvement, operating within a circle of competence, and patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The fact that this successful journey began at the age of 52 serves as an inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

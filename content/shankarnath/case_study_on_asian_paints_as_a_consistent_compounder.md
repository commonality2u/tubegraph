The phrase "[[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | consistent Compounders]]" is frequently discussed among Indian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While there's no single definition, it generally refers to a company exhibiting steady generation of profits, sales growth, or consistent stock market returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Identifying a [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | consistent compounder]] involves analyzing nine variables, combining both qualitative and quantitative parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Asian Paints Limited serves as an excellent case study to demonstrate these characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Quantitative Factors

### Sustainable and High Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
A key [[financial_metrics_for_identifying_compounders | financial parameter]] for [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | Compounders]] is a sustainable and high ROCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This metric is a combination of recurring revenues, high gross margins, and low capital intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For Asian Paints, a consistent ROCE of at least 20% is a definite characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### Steady Revenue and Earnings Growth
[[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | Compounders]] consistently generate steady revenue and earnings growth over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This growth is reliable and sustainable, even if not always spectacular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The two leading paint companies in India have tripled their sales over the last decade with consistent growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This indicates that their business, cash flows, and profits are less sensitive to changing economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Asian Paints demonstrates adequately high and consistently growing sales, regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. A modest top-line growth of at least 12% over many years is desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Opportunity Size
[[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | Potential Compounders]] operate in markets with long growth runways, allowing them to grow for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The growth runway can involve a small company within a large industry (like Indigo in paints with 2% market share) or an expanding industry (like [[indias_specialty_chemicals_industry_growth_prospects | Specialty Chemicals]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While Asian Paints is India's largest paint company, ranked second in Asia and seventh worldwide, its growth prospects remain strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The domestic paints industry is projected to grow annually at 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Asian Paints has a broad product portfolio beyond paints, including waterproofing, adhesives, bath fittings, and decorative lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. It also has manufacturing facilities in 14 countries outside India, contributing 9% of total revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. The company's industrial business crossed ₹1,000 crores in the last financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a> and is entering the [[comparative_analysis_of_major_indian_cement_companies | white cement]] manufacturing space through a joint venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

### Profit Margins and EPS Growth
Analyzing profits involves looking at both margins and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Earnings Per Share (EPS) is preferred over net profit to standardize earnings and better reflect shareholder value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. A high operating margin indicates efficiency and business model strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Asian Paints' operating margins have been consistent, ranging between 16% and 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Its EPS has grown every year except for 2022, doubling every five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF)
Free Cash Flow (FCF) represents what remains for management to use internally or distribute to shareholders after covering all operating and capital expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. While its application can vary by industry, a high FCF is generally positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Asian Paints has consistently been a strong FCF generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Despite a planned increase in capital expenditure to ₹2,000-2,300 crores, its history of strong FCF generation remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

## Qualitative Factors

### High-Quality Franchise
A high-quality franchise possesses a strong, recognizable brand, a good reputation, and sustainable competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. These advantages can include unique technology, exclusive rights, loyal customers, or a superior distribution network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Such businesses have a strong track record of solid financial performance across economic cycles and enduring demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Asian Paints fits this description, featuring among India's top 20 best brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. It boasts the widest and strongest distributor base with over 1.5 lakh retail touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The enduring demand for paint ensures consistent financial performance across various economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

### Pricing Power
Pricing power is the ability to increase product or service prices without significantly impacting sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Companies with pricing power often have deep competitive advantages, few substitutes, and are considered essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Even though the paint industry is heavily reliant on petroleum products for raw materials, Asian Paints has successfully passed on cost increases to consumers and even grown its margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

### Industry Market Share
The relative strength of a company within its industry is crucial for identifying [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | Compounders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | Compounders]] often have high barriers to entry and strong market share in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets, usually due to intangible assets and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Asian Paints, with a 53% market share, is a clear leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. This dominant position allows the company to enjoy economies of scale, leading to lower production costs and higher profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Quality Management
The character and ability of [[role_of_management_in_consistent_compounders | management]] are vital factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Regularly tracking management through quarterly earnings calls provides insights into their quality, discipline, capital allocation, and short/long-term focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Asian Paints possesses a strong [[role_of_management_in_consistent_compounders | quality management]] team, which continuously develops internal talent and actively seeks external expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## Conclusion

Asian Paints Limited fulfills numerous criteria in the [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | consistent compounder]] checklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. While identifying the right company for [[consistent_compounding_and_its_importance | consistent compounding]] remains challenging, this nine-point methodology combining [[financial_metrics_for_identifying_compounders | quantitative]] and [[qualitative_characteristics_of_compounders | qualitative]] variables can help in building a solid portfolio of such companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. When it comes to [[what_is_a_consistent_compounder | Compounders]], the margin of safety is less about calculating intrinsic value and more about confidence in the company's competitive advantages strengthening over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. Sometimes, high P/E ratios (e.g., 40-80) can be justified for companies with decades of growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Asian Paints, despite a consistent P/E ratio around 60 between 2015 and 2023, delivered an annualized share price growth of 17% because its sales, cash flows, and profits consistently compounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

The [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | Stock Lending and Borrowing Mechanism]] ([[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]]) is a method that allows stock owners to "rent out" their shares and earn additional income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Globally, this product is very popular, and it has existed in India for over 10 years, since its creation in 1997 as the Securities Lending Scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Understanding SLBM
[[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] involves the temporary advancement of securities by a lender to a borrower for a specified duration and a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It functions much like renting out an idle asset, such as a car, to generate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The three main [[participants_and_process_of_slbm | participants in any SLBM process]] are the lender (owner of shares), the borrower (who temporarily uses the shares), and the exchange (which ensures proper transaction execution within rules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The [[participants_and_process_of_slbm | typical SLBM process]] involves registration via stockbrokers, mutual agreement on loan terms, the borrower placing collateral, share transfer, and finally, the return of shares with payment of the lending fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Anyone, including insurance companies, banks, short sellers, fund houses, high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), and retail investors, can participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Benefits of SLBM

### For Lenders
For long-term investors, [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] provides several advantages:
*   **Extra Income**: It allows investors to earn relatively risk-free returns on their idle stock assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This fee is earned on top of potential dividends and capital appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Counterparty Risk Mitigation**: There is no direct counterparty risk because transactions are guaranteed by a Clearing Corporation (either the National Securities Clearing Corporation of India or the BSE-owned Indian Clearing Corporation Limited) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Corporate Actions Entitlement**: Lenders remain the owners of their shares and are entitled to corporate actions such as dividends, bonuses, and stock splits during the lending period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The exchange facilitates the recovery and transfer of dividends from the borrower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, and adjusts for bonus issues, rights issues, buybacks, and stock splits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Taxation Perspective**: [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] transactions are not treated as a transfer or sale of securities, which helps from a taxation standpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Recall Option**: Lenders have the option to close the contract earlier by placing a "recall order," allowing them to get their shares back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### For Borrowers and the Market
[[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] serves various purposes for borrowers and contributes to market efficiency:
*   **Market Liquidity**: It improves market liquidity, benefiting all stock market participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Efficient Short Selling**: [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] enables more efficient short selling operations, which aids in price discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   **Short Selling**: Borrowers can use [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] to borrow shares, sell them with the expectation of a price fall, then buy them back at a lower price, returning them to the lender and profiting from the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Risk Management**: Traders can use [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] for hedging to manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Asset Exposure**: It allows borrowers to gain exposure to certain assets without directly owning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Stock Price Arbitrage**: Borrowers can exploit price differences of a share on different exchanges to make quick profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Covering Short Positions**: [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] helps borrowers cover their short positions to avoid settlement failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Repay Option**: Borrowers can return shares earlier than the contract settlement period through a "repay option," where the order is executed if it matches a pending order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Risks of SLBM

### For Lenders
While the exchange guarantees transactions by requiring borrowers to put up a margin of 125% of the borrowed stock's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, ensuring sufficient protection for the lender, there is a remaining risk:
*   **Closeout Risk**: This occurs when the borrower fails to return the shares at the agreed time or upon demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### For Borrowers
*   **Market Risk (Implicit)**: Although not explicitly stated as a risk *of SLBM*, a borrower engaging in short-selling faces market risk if the stock price does not fall as expected. If the price increases, the borrower will incur losses when buying back shares to return them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Features and Operational Aspects of SLBM

*   **Tenure**: An [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] contract can range from one month to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Qualifying Stocks**: Over 600 stocks qualify under the [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] framework, including many A-group stocks. This list changes monthly and is available on the NSE website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Expiry**: [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] contracts expire on the first Thursday of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: The highest liquidity for [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] contracts is typically found in the most recent one or two-month contracts, with volumes decreasing rapidly for longer tenures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Minimum Order Value**: Brokerages have varying requirements for minimum order value. For example, Zerodha requires a minimum order value of â‚¹1 lakh per security for lenders and at least 500 shares for borrowers, while Motilal Oswal Securities and HDFC Securities have no such limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Lending Fees Calculation**: The annualized yield for a lender can be calculated by dividing the per-share lending fee by the current share price, then annualizing it based on the contract tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Median yields observed can be around 1.5%, but can be significantly higher for some stocks at certain times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### [[charges_and_taxation_related_to_slbm_transactions | Charges and Taxation]]
*   **Charges**: As per current norms, there are no Securities Transaction Tax (STT) charges, SEBI turnover charges, stamp duty, or transaction charges on [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Taxation**: The movement of shares between demat accounts in [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] is not tagged as a transfer or sale, meaning no capital gains tax is payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. However, the lending fee received by the lender is considered "income from other sources" and is added to the lender's taxable income, taxed according to their income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Commission**: Brokerage commissions vary, for instance, Zerodha charges 20%, while Kotak Securities and HDFC Securities charge 15% of the lending fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The brokerage is paid on the lending fee earned, not on the actual value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. After deducting commission and GST, the net fee is credited to the lender's savings account upon contract expiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Participating in the [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] segment typically involves contacting a stockbroker's relationship manager, as transactions are often managed offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, form the core of a [[defensive_vs_enterprising_investing_strategies | defensive portfolio strategy]] designed to offer stability, resistance to economic downturns, and lower volatility, while aiming for above-average stock market returns [00:00:38]. This approach prioritizes defense over aggressive attack, much like a strong defensive football team winning titles by conceding few goals [00:00:07].

## What Are Defensive Businesses?

A defensive business produces goods and services that consumers continue to purchase even during economic downturns [00:01:38]. Their revenues are less susceptible to economic fluctuations, meaning they are non-cyclical in nature [00:02:35].

Key sectors and examples include:
*   **Utilities** such as electricity, water, and gas connections, which are essential for daily life [00:01:50].
*   **Healthcare Services** including doctor visits, treatments, surgeries, and medicines [00:02:01].
*   **Education**, a priority for most families despite economic challenges [00:02:06].
*   **Personal Care Products** like toothpaste, soap, shampoo, and face wash [00:02:12].
*   **Household Goods** such as cleaning supplies and kitchen essentials, necessary for maintaining a functional living space [00:02:19].
*   **Telecommunications** including mobile plans and internet connections, which have become vital [00:02:25].

Examples of companies in these sectors include HL, Asian Paints, BTI, AEL, and Avenue Supermarts [00:02:47].

## Identifying Defensive Stocks

Two primary methods can be used to identify defensive stocks:

### 1. Industry/Sector Classification
This involves looking for companies within the non-cyclical sectors mentioned above [00:03:08].
*   **Using Stock Screeners:** Platforms like screener.in allow users to filter by industry, while ticker tape offers a sector drop-down menu [00:02:53].

### 2. Stock Beta
A stock's beta measures its volatility relative to the broader market [00:03:12].
*   **Low Beta:** Defensive, non-cyclical stocks typically have a low beta, meaning they are less volatile than the broader market (e.g., Nifty 50) [00:03:21]. A beta of less than one theoretically suggests that including such stocks can reduce the overall risk of a portfolio [00:03:51].
*   **Example:** If the market falls by 10%, a stock with a low beta of 0.19, like Hindustan Unilever, might only fall by 1.9% historically [00:03:30].

### Additional Characteristics
Besides stable demand, resilient earnings, and a low beta, non-cyclical stocks often possess:
*   A history of strong, consistent, and rising [[Dividend Investing Strategies | dividends]] [00:04:02].
*   Strong balance sheets with low debt levels, enabling them to weather economic downturns effectively [00:04:07].
*   Market leadership with established brands and dominant market positions [00:04:15].

## Investing in Non-Cyclical Stocks

### Active Investing: The Coffee Can Approach
One approach is similar to the "coffee can" style of investing, where an equal amount of money is invested in a portfolio of 15-20 defensive stocks and held for several years [00:04:27]. Historically, a portfolio of 30 compiled defensive companies has outperformed the Nifty 50 over 5, 7, and 10-year periods, and in most individual years [00:04:57]. This demonstrates that a [[defensive_vs_enterprising_investing_strategies | defensive portfolio]] can often be an aggressive performer [00:05:14].

### Passive Investing: Nifty Non-Cyclical Consumer Index (NCCI)
For a passively managed portfolio solution, the Nifty Non-Cyclical Consumer Index (NCCI) tracks the performance of a portfolio of stocks representing the non-cyclical consumer theme [00:05:48].

#### NCCI Construction Process
1.  **Identify Industries:** The index focuses on specific consumer-facing sectors from the Nifty industry classification, such as consumer goods, telecom, media services, entertainment, textiles, and FMCG [00:06:07].
2.  **Select Top Companies:** The 30 largest companies from these industries are selected based on their six-month average free-float market capitalization [00:06:31]. This list is reviewed semi-annually in January and July [00:06:46].
3.  **Assign Weightage:** A weight is assigned to each stock based on its free-float market capitalization. Differences in free-float percentages can lead to significant differences in weightage even for companies with similar market capitalizations [00:06:52].
4.  **Risk Management:** The NCCI caps the weightage of each stock at a maximum of 10% to manage risk [00:07:20].

#### NCCI Performance
The NCCI has historically performed better than both the Nifty 50 and Nifty 500 across various time periods, with a total price return of 16.2% since its inception in April 2005 [00:07:47].

*   **Consistency:** The NCCI shows consistent annual returns, with numbers like 20.4%, 23.9%, 32%, and so on, from 2011 onwards [00:08:09].
*   **Resilience during Downturns:** In 2008, when the Nifty 50 lost 52% of its value, the NCCI actually gained 4.6%, demonstrating its stability, low volatility, and ability to absorb economic downturns [00:08:33].
*   **Low Beta:** The NCCI's beta relative to the Nifty 500 averages around 0.78, indicating low volatility and making it a strong [[Asset allocation strategies | diversification tool]], especially for portfolios heavy in large caps and midcaps [00:09:06].

## [[Investing patterns and strategies | Investing Strategies]] with NCCI

An interesting pattern observed is the alternating performance of the NCCI and Nifty 50 on a year-on-year basis [00:09:22]. For instance, if Nifty 50 performs better in one year, NCCI tends to outperform in the next, and vice versa [00:09:28].

This pattern can be converted into an [[Investment and portfolio growth strategies | investing strategy]]:
*   **Alternating Investment:** Based on the previous year's performance, invest in the index that performed worse (assuming it will perform better in the current year) [00:10:00].
*   **Hypothetical Returns:** Applying this alternating sequence from 2014 to 2023, a 1 lakh rupee investment could have grown to 6.6 lakh rupees, representing a pre-tax 10-year CAGR of 20.8% [00:11:19].
*   **Long-Term Returns:** Starting in January 2007, this strategy could have yielded a 17-year pre-tax CAGR of 21.7% [00:11:53]. Even after a 10% long-term capital gains tax, the annualized return would be 19.9% over 17 years, turning 1 lakh rupees into 21.7 lakhs (excluding dividends) [00:12:07].

## Current Investment Options
As of now, the HDFC Non-Cyclical Consumer Index Fund is an available option [00:12:43]. Groww has also filed for a similar NFO (New Fund Offer) [00:12:50].

## Considerations for Investors
This fund is suitable for investors seeking stable and consistent returns with a relatively lower risk tolerance [00:12:56]. However, it's important to acknowledge inherent risks:
*   **Underperformance Periods:** There will be periods where the consumption theme might underperform other sectors or the broader market, as seen in the last three years since COVID [00:13:17].
*   **Valuation Risk:** The consumer theme in India generally has high valuations (high P/E ratios). This makes the timing of lump-sum entry and exit crucial, especially if not planning to hold the investment for a decent period [00:13:31]. Investors should be cautious with valuations, even if they appear to plateau around the 60 P/E mark [00:13:49].

Despite these risks, the NCCI offers a relatively stable way to participate in equities, providing low volatility and a significant degree of recession proofing [00:14:04]. The consumer sector in India also benefits from macro tailwinds such as rising GDP per capita, a young population, urbanization, and a growing organized sector [00:14:36].

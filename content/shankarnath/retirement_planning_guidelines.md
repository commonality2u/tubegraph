Understanding how much money one should have saved at different ages is a common concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide presents a series of numbers indicating appropriate portfolio sizes for various age groups, serving as a tracker or marker to identify potential gaps in savings or wealth building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It's important to note that this is not a precise [[using_customized_financial_planning_for_retirement | financial planning]] or [[using_customized_financial_planning_for_retirement | retirement planning]] calculator, as individual incomes, expenses, habits, lifestyles, and [[planning_expenses_and_investment_for_early_retirement | retirement age]] goals differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The 20s: Laying Financial Foundations

For most 20-year-olds, starting with significant savings is uncommon, often due to student debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This decade is crucial for establishing good financial habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Key financial habits for your 20s:
*   **Budgeting**: Systematically track income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Emergency Fund**: Maintain two months' worth of expenses in an emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Term Insurance**: Secure a term insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Savings Rate**: Aim to save 5-15% of your salary, even if it's a small amount like 2,000 Rupees a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)**: Start an SIP and consistently track wealth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Credit Score**: Use a credit card responsibly to build a credit score, which is beneficial for future loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Always pay outstandings on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## The 30s: Achieving Your First Milestone

By your 30th birthday, your savings or portfolio should ideally equal your annual salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. For example, if your annual income is 12 lakhs, your portfolio should be 12 lakhs or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Assumptions for the 30s:
*   **Annual Income Increment**: Estimated at 12% per annum, factoring in a pay hike and potential job changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Savings Rate**: Settled at 20%, acknowledging that many households have both partners working and children are still young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Return**: Assumed at 10% annually, considering a mix of fixed income instruments (like PPF, EPF) and equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

By age 35, the portfolio-to-income ratio is expected to be almost 2:1, meaning your portfolio is nearly double your annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. By age 39, this ratio can reach 2.7 times your annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. While wealth generation isn't a straight line and returns can fluctuate, these are useful benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Managing Liquidity Needs

In scenarios requiring urgent funds when investments like mutual funds are down, a "loan against mutual fund" platform like Yeno can be an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This digital process allows for efficient loan receipt, management, and repayment, offering attractive interest rates (e.g., 10.5%) which are lower than personal loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Unlike personal loans, only monthly interest might be required, providing better control over cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## The 40s: Maintaining Financial Momentum

As you enter your 40s, questions may arise about including EPF contributions within savings rates or valuing property in corpus calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. There are no strict rules, but it's advisable to be mid-range in your estimates â€“ neither too conservative nor too aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This exercise aims to gauge your financial track and act as a catalyst for increased savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Assumptions for the 40s:
*   **Annual Income Increment**: Assumed at 10% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Savings Rate**: Reduced to 15% to account for growing children's requirements and aging parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Return**: Kept at 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

By age 49, the portfolio should be approximately 3.7 crores, equating to 4.3 times the then-annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## The 50s: Approaching Retirement Goals

Many individuals aspire not to be actively working in their 50s, a valid goal that requires solid financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Assumptions for the 50s:
*   **Starting Corpus (age 50)**: 4.3 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Savings Rate**: Assumed at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Salary Increment**: Assumed at 8% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Return**: Assumed at 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

By age 60, upon retiring from active work, your corpus should ideally be a little over 16 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This translates to a portfolio-to-income ratio of eight times your pre-retirement gross income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This conclusion aligns with studies by firms like T. Rowe Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## The 60s and Beyond: Sustaining Retirement

This period tests the sustainability of accumulated wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Assumptions for post-retirement:
*   **Initial Expenses (age 61 onwards)**: Assumed to be 60% of the 60th-year expenses (which were 80% of income), resulting in 96 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Inflation**: Assumed at 7% per annum, increasing expenses each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Returns**: Maintained at 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

Under these assumptions, the accumulated corpus continues to grow for a few more years, typically until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. However, due to inflation, expenses eventually catch up, and the money could be depleted around the 82nd year mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This highlights the importance of judgment and prudence in spending, potential continued work, and ongoing financial management during [[using_customized_financial_planning_for_retirement | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## Summary of Financial Milestones

*   **Starting Point (Age 30)**: Your savings should at least equal your annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Key Variables**: The simulation uses a few simple variables: income, annual increments, initial corpus, savings rate, and return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **[[determining_your_retirement_number | Retirement Number]] (Age 60)**: Aim for assets totaling eight times your pre-retirement gross income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Exceeding this is even better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

This framework provides a realistic guide for [[planning_expenses_and_investment_for_early_retirement | planning expenses and investment]] across different life stages, offering portfolio benchmarks to help ensure you are on track for your [[using_customized_financial_planning_for_retirement | retirement]] goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

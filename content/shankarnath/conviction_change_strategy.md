The "conviction change" strategy is a [[contrarian_investing_strategy|contrarian investing strategy]] that involves trusting the recommendations of equity analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:01">[05:18:01]</a>. This technique focuses on shifts in analyst consensus regarding a stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:01">[05:34:01]</a>.

## How it Works
The strategy involves investing in stocks where the analyst consensus has shifted from a "net sell" recommendation to a "net buy" recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:01">[05:36:01]</a>. This change in consensus recommendations is considered a robust return predictor, as it incorporates information not available in other predictive variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:01">[05:54:01]</a>.

## Performance
A 2017 report by Motilal Oswal Securities, which analyzed data over a 10-year period, suggested that a portfolio of stocks identified by this method could have delivered an annual return of 24.1% over a one-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:01">[05:31:01]</a>.

## Caveat
The speaker notes that they have not personally tried this technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:01">[05:26:01]</a>. It is advised to verify these claims, adhering to the Russian proverb: "Trust but verify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:01">[06:04:01]</a>.

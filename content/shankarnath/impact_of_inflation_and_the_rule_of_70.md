Thumb rules are guiding principles that, while not 100% accurate, are sufficiently error-free and based on real-life situations rather than theories, aiding in faster calculations and quick decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Many such rules exist to help estimate various financial outcomes.

## The Rule of 70 and Inflation

The [[the_rule_of_70_for_inflation | Rule of 70]] is a thumb rule that estimates the [[effects_of_inflation_on_retirement_savings | impact of inflation]] on one's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Calculating the Impact of Inflation

To use the rule, divide 70 by the long-term inflation rate of a country. The result indicates the number of years it will take for money to halve in value due to [[role_of_inflation_and_money_illusion_in_investing | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

For example:
*   If you have one crore rupees stashed away in a locker and the long-term inflation rate is five percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   Dividing 70 by 5 gives 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   This means that in approximately 14 years, that one crore of rupees will be worth half (50 lakhs) if no action is taken to invest or protect its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

This rule is a very handy tool for understanding the [[role_of_inflation_and_money_illusion_in_investing | time value of money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Thumb Rules

Similar to the [[the_rule_of_72_for_doubling_money | Rule of 72]] (which estimates the time for money to double) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08">[01:08]</a> and the [[the_rule_of_114_for_tripling_money | Rule of 114]] (which estimates the time for money to triple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, the Rule of 70 provides a quick estimate for the corrosive effect of [[effects_of_inflation_on_retirement_savings | inflation]] on savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

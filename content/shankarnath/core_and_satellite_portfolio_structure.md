A portfolio is not merely a collection of assets; when properly constructed, it can function as a powerful wealth creation engine. One effective way to structure an investment portfolio is using the [[core_satellite_asset_allocation_method | core and satellite structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This approach integrates foundational, stable investments with more dynamic, targeted ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Core Portfolio

The core component of a portfolio consists of foundational investments designed to provide stability and broad diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Its primary objective is to offer a low draw-down risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. These foundational investments are typically achieved through:
*   Broad-based Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   Actively managed mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>
*   Index mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>

Certain strategies, such as momentum-value, can evolve to become part of the core portfolio over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Satellite Portfolio

The satellite component allows for more adventurous and tactical investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. These are typically smaller, more concentrated, and carry slightly higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The objective of the satellite portfolio is to:
*   Capture additional growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
*   Further diversify the core holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>

Satellite investments often involve targeted investments in specific sectors, regions, or asset classes, utilizing various ETFs and mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This part of the portfolio typically requires more frequent tracking and review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Core-Satellite Allocation Ratio

A common approach to splitting assets between the core and satellite components is an 80/20 ratio, allowing for a 5% deviation in either direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This ratio is a guideline and can be adjusted based on an individual investor's comfort level and evolving investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Benefits of the Core and Satellite Structure

Implementing a core and satellite structure helps in:
*   **Balancing Stability and Growth**: The core provides a stable base, while the satellite allows for higher growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: It ensures broad market exposure through the core while adding targeted diversification through the satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Structured Investing**: It provides a blueprint for investment, making security selection more coherent and decision-making stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

The speaker notes that using such a structure can make investing more passive, requiring less frequent portfolio reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Gold has been a significant commodity since the start of human civilization, with approximately 200,000 tons mined globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While half of this is used in jewelry and 20% in coins, gold mutual funds, and ETFs, a substantial portion is considered investable gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Even influential investors like Warren Buffett, despite his general dislike for gold, have invested in related precious metals, such as 3,700 tons of [[silver_as_an_investment_compared_to_gold | silver]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Why Invest in Gold?

Investing in gold offers several compelling advantages, making it a valuable addition to an investment portfolio.

### Consistent Returns and Low Volatility

Over the past 40 years, gold has demonstrated a respectable Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. If an annual Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) had been followed, this number would rise to 10.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Key performance indicators include:
*   **Infrequent Price Falls**: The price of gold has fallen on a year-on-year basis only seven times over the last four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Limited Downside**: The maximum annual fall in gold's price over the past 40 years has been 14%, which compares favorably to the BSE Sensex, which experienced annual falls of 14% or more on seven different occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Reduced Volatility**: From a risk perspective, gold exhibits significantly less volatility compared to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Hedging Tool and Portfolio Diversifier

Gold and stock markets often exhibit an inverse correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This characteristic makes gold an extremely efficient hedging tool for asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Gold tends to perform well when stock markets are depressed or during periods of financial calamity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This has been observed during downturns such as 1991-92, 2000, 2008-2009, 2020, and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For this reason, it is often recommended that investors allocate around 10% of their portfolios to gold as a [[gold_etfs_as_a_portfolio_diversifier | portfolio diversifier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Accessibility and Low Entry Points

Gold is available in various forms, including physical gold (jewelry, coins, bullion) and electronic instruments like digital gold, [[gold_etfs_as_a_portfolio_diversifier | Gold ETFs]], gold mutual funds, and Sovereign Gold Bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Most gold investment options are readily accessible:
*   **Physical Gold**: Can be bought from banks or jewelers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold**: Available on many mobile fintech apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, with purchases possible for as little as one rupee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Gold Mutual Funds & ETFs**: Can be bought on aggregator or trading platforms, or mutual fund websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. [[factors_influencing_the_value_and_performance_of_gold_etfs | Gold ETFs]] require a minimum of one unit (0.01 grams of gold, or about 60 rupees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, while gold mutual funds can be started with just 100 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)**: Issued by the RBI in tranches every few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, and also tradable on Indian stock exchanges, much like shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. SGBs require a minimum purchase of one gram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Advantages of Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)

[[risks_and_returns_associated_with_different_gold_investment_options | Sovereign Gold Bonds]] are particularly popular in India, having raised significant capital for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

*   **No Visible Expenses**: Unlike other gold products, SGBs have no explicit expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Online applications with electronic payments even qualify for a 50 rupee per gram discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Fixed Interest Payment**: SGBs offer a fixed interest rate of 2.5% per annum on the initial investment, credited twice a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This feature is unique among gold investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Higher Expected Returns**: Combining the gold appreciation (e.g., 9% annually) with the 2.5% interest, SGBs can offer an expected return of over 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Tax Efficiency**:
    *   The 2.5% annual interest income is added to one's income and taxed at the prevailing income tax slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
    *   Capital gains realized upon redeeming SGBs at their 8-year maturity are entirely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This tax exemption applies whether the SGB was bought during its launch or from the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
    *   Premature encashment after five years (allowed by RBI) may also be tax-free, though it is advised to consult a tax advisor for definitive guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### Liquidity

Generally, gold investments offer good liquidity:
*   **Physical Gold**: Jewelers readily buy back ornaments and coins, often providing payment on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs and Mutual Funds**: Can be liquidated during trading hours, with funds typically reaching bank accounts within a couple of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold**: Offers the highest liquidity, with units available for sale 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

For SGBs, while they have an 8-year maturity, early redemption is possible through the secondary market after six months of issuance (though these bonds often sell at a discount due to low liquidity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> or by premature encashment via RBI after five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Loans can also be obtained against SGBs, for example, up to 20 lakhs with an LTV of 65% from State Bank of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

When considering gold as an investment, it is crucial to assess factors such as the investment objective, holding period, and safety aspects, in addition to availability, risk, returns, costs, liquidity, and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

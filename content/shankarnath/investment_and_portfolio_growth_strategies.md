Many individuals question if they have saved enough for their age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article presents a series of numbers indicating appropriate portfolio sizes at different ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It's important to treat this information as a tracker or marker to identify potential gaps in one's savings and [[Investment strategies for wealth creation | wealth building]] schedule, rather than a definitive financial or retirement planning calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A relevant worksheet is available for examination and personal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Financial Milestones by Age

### The 20s: Foundations of Financial Success
For individuals in their 20s, there's typically no specific savings number, and it might even be negative due to student debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. However, this period is crucial for building good financial habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Key actions include:
*   **Budgeting**: Regularly track income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Emergency Fund**: Save two months' worth of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Insurance**: Acquire a term insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Savings**: Aim to save 5%, 10%, or 15% of your salary, even if it's a small amount like 2,000 Rupees a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Investing**: Set up a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and monitor wealth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   **Credit Building**: Use a credit card responsibly to build a credit score, which is useful for future loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### The 30s: First Financial Marker
By the age of 30, a portfolio should ideally equal one's annual salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. For example, an annual income of 12 lakhs (1 lakh/month) would suggest a portfolio of 12 lakhs or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Variables used in calculations for this decade:
*   **Annual Income Increment**: Estimated at 12% per annum (e.g., 10% pay hike + job change jump) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Savings Rate**: Assumed at 20%, common for households with young children and dual incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Return**: Assumed at 10% annually, considering a mix of fixed income instruments (like PPF, EPF) and equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

**Projected Portfolio Growth**:
*   **Age 30**: Portfolio equals 1x annual income (e.g., 12 lakhs income, 12 lakhs portfolio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
*   **Age 35**: Portfolio is almost 2x annual income (e.g., 21 lakhs income, 42 lakhs portfolio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   **Age 39**: Portfolio reaches 2.7 times annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, with annual income up to 33 lakhs and annual savings reaching 55,000 rupees a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Mutual Funds and Loans Against Mutual Funds
> While [[Investment strategies for wealth creation | wealth generation]] is not a straight line and portfolio returns can fluctuate, platforms like YMO offer loans against mutual funds (LAMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This allows urgent access to funds without prematurely redeeming mutual fund units when underlying investments are strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. YMO offers a 100% digital process, attractive interest rates (10.5%), and flexible repayment terms (monthly interest only, no foreclosure or prepayment fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

### The 40s: Sustaining Growth
The 40s start with an income of 36.6 lakhs and a portfolio just over 1 Crore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

Variables for this decade:
*   **Annual Income Increment**: 10% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Savings Rate**: Reduced to 15% to accommodate growing children's needs and aging parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   **Annual Portfolio Returns**: Maintained at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

**Projected Portfolio Growth**:
*   By the age of 49, the portfolio is projected to be around 3.7 Crores, which is 4.3 times the then-annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

### The 50s: Nearing Retirement
At the age of 50, the expected corpus is 4.3 Crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

Variables for this decade:
*   **Savings Rate**: 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   **Salary Increment**: 8% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **Annual Portfolio Returns**: 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

**Projected Portfolio Growth**:
*   By the age of 60, when active work might cease, the portfolio should reach a little over 16 Crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. This results in a portfolio to income ratio of eight (16 Crores corpus divided by 2 Crores income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. This conclusion aligns with studies by firms like T. Rowe Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

### The 60s and Beyond: Post-Retirement Analysis
The accumulated 16 Crores by age 60 is tested to determine its sustainability in post-retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: While the savings rate at age 60 suggests an 80% expense rate (1.6 Crores), post-retirement expenses are assumed to tighten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. From age 61 onwards, with zero income, expenses are assumed to be 60% of the 60th-year expenses, or 96 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. This expense increases annually by 7% due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Returns**: Maintained at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

**Sustainability**:
*   The corpus, net of expenses, continues to grow for a few more years until around age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. However, due to inflation, expenses eventually catch up, and the money is projected to be depleted by the 82nd year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

## Recap of [[Investment philosophy and strategy | Investment Philosophy and Strategy]]
The [[Investment strategies for wealth creation | financial journey]] effectively starts from age 30, with the goal of having savings at least equal to one's annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. This simulation used basic variables: income, annual increments, initial corpus, savings rate, and return on [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

Key output:
*   Defined age and portfolio bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.
*   For those aiming to retire around age 60, the target is to accumulate assets totaling eight times their pre-retirement gross income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. Exceeding this target is even better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

Users are encouraged to use the provided worksheet to adjust numbers and formulas to suit their individual situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

While there is no formal definition, microcap companies are generally considered a subset of [[basics_of_small_cap_investing | small caps]], including companies ranked beyond the top 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. In terms of market capitalization, this often refers to companies with a market cap below 6400 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It's important to note that many microcap companies are not necessarily unknown and can even be industry leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Identifying and investing in these stocks early can potentially generate excess returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

[[characteristics_of_microcap_investing | Microcap investing]] can evoke various emotions, some based on facts, others on misunderstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Understanding their specific characteristics is crucial for effective selection.

## Characteristics Impacting Selection

*   **Under-researched**: Microcap stocks often operate "under the radar" of research analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A study by Motilal Oswal indicated that 40% of companies in the Nifty Microcap 250 index receive no analyst coverage, and only 12% have five or more analysts tracking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This "blind spot" for institutional investors can be advantageous for individual investors to find undervalued stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **High Insider Ownership**: Microcap companies often have a high degree of insider ownership, with almost half of the companies in the Microcap 250 index having a promoter holding over 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The presence of an ethical, progressive owner-operator is a positive sign from a shareholder's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: This is a debatable point. While microcaps typically have low trading volumes, making entry or exit difficult and transaction costs higher due to wider bid-ask spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, this illiquidity can also be a driver for multibagger returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Illiquid stocks are often inefficiently priced and attract less competition, primarily from retail and long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Volatility**: Microcaps exhibit high volatility, especially over the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. They tend to perform best when markets are rising fast but are the worst performers when markets fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. High volatility is often the price paid for better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Other Factors**:
    *   Generally offer lower dividend payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Less transparency and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   Higher risk of promoter fraud, price manipulation, and pump-and-dump schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   The potential to pick a future large-cap company like HDFC Bank or Reliance Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Selection Criteria

Selecting microcap companies goes beyond typical screening and requires thorough analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Ian Castle's Essential Selection Criteria

Ian Castle, a microcap-focused investor, suggests seven essential criteria:

1.  **Market Leadership**: The microcap company should be a leader in its market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
2.  **Intelligent and Iconoclastic Management**: The company should be run by individuals who are "intelligent fanatics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
3.  **Sustainable Profitability**: The company must be profitable and capable of self-funding its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
4.  **Low or No Debt**: A strong balance sheet with minimal leverage is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
5.  **Clean Capital Structure**: Avoid companies with significant amounts of warrants and options as a percentage of outstanding shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
6.  **Low Institutional Ownership**: Low institutional ownership indicates less analyst coverage and potentially undervalued opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
7.  **Gross Undervaluation**: Invest in businesses that are grossly undervalued, ideally at a 50-60% discount to their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Hard Metrics for Screening

To convert the thousands of microcap companies into a manageable set of potential stocks, specific quantitative metrics can be used:

1.  **Market Capitalization**: Limit the selection universe to companies with a market cap of at least 500 crores (to avoid extremely small companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
2.  **Promoter Shareholding**: Look for owner-operators, ideally with promoter shareholding of at least 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
3.  **Revenue and Profit Growth**: Target companies with at least 15% growth in sales and 20% growth in profit after tax (PAT) annually for the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
4.  **Leverage (Debt-to-Equity)**: Debt as a percentage of equity should be low, ideally 20% or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
5.  **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)**: The effectiveness of turning capital into profits should be high, with ROCE of 20% or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
6.  **Relative Valuation (P/E Ratio)**: Companies whose Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is lower than the industry's average P/E multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

After applying such a screening process, the median five-year sales growth can be significantly higher (e.g., 25% vs. 15% target) and median ROCE much higher (e.g., 38% vs. 20% target) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Post-Screening Analysis

Once a list of potential microcap stocks is generated from the screener, it's essential to look beyond the metrics and examine each company individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This requires a thorough fundamental analysis, including:

*   Examining the last three years of annual reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   Reviewing earnings transcripts from recent quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   Checking for any news surrounding the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   Consulting research reports by equity analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   Evaluating the management team and business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Advanced Selection Criteria (For Your Information)

In more developed markets, fund managers employ additional metrics and factors to refine their selection criteria for microcaps:

*   **QI Value**: Using Qi Value in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Factor-Based Funds**: Microcap funds built around factors like value, momentum, and earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a> (value factor often performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>).
*   **Technical Indicators**: Strategies that use concepts like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Piotroski F-score, and average trading volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## [[behavioral_aspects_of_microcap_investing | Behavioral Aspects]] in Selection

Beyond specific criteria, investor behavior significantly impacts success in microcap investing:

*   **Patience**: Microcap investing requires substantial patience, as it can take years for the share price to reflect a company's true worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Pickiness and Discipline**: The ability to "say no" is crucial; one must be highly selective and disciplined when choosing microcap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Staggered Investment**: Instead of buying everything at once, consider investing capital in stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. For example, one-third after due diligence, one-third after meeting management, and the final one-third after management has executed a portion of their promised plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This allows for averaging up as conviction grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Differentiate Business and Stock Performance**: Understand that a company's earnings per share (EPS) can double while its share price remains stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This often indicates undervaluation and can be a good time to invest, assuming no fundamental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Margin of Safety**: Apply a sufficient margin of safety, focusing on businesses that have the potential to grow profits by 300-500% over the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

Implementing a [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | Coffee Can Investing]] strategy, while potentially rewarding, comes with several [[challenges_and_lessons_in_investing | challenges]] and considerations for investors.

## Initial Research and Stock Selection
The success of a [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can investing]] program hinges entirely on the quality of stocks chosen to be placed inside the "coffee can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This requires significant initial research and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.

Key considerations for stock selection include:
*   **Identification of High-Quality Businesses** A high-quality business is defined by four major characteristics:
    *   **Business Longevity** Operational for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Revenue Growth** Consistent annual growth of at least 10% *every single year* over the last decade, not just a 10-year CAGR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)** An ROCE of 15% is considered ideal, indicating efficient use of equity and debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
    *   **Market Capitalization** A market cap of at least 100 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Applying Filters** Some of these filters can be very difficult for an average investor to implement manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. For example, checking for a minimum 10% revenue growth *every single year* for the last decade requires pulling up specific annual revenue numbers, a task that can be time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Even finding four popular companies meeting the 10% growth in nine of the last ten years took 20 minutes of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond Basic Filters** Even after applying the core [[key_characteristics_of_highquality_businesses_for_coffee_can_investing | coffee can filters]], further manual sifting is required:
    *   **Excluding Cyclical Companies** Blindly filter out cyclical, commodity-based companies and sectors like steel, sugar, metals, infrastructure, power, cement, and real estate, as well as PSU businesses and highly regulated sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Additional Financial Filters** Apply further filters such as:
        *   Debt-to-equity ratio: preferably less than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.
        *   Unpledged promoter holding: ideally 40% to 50% to ensure "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Corporate Governance** Thoroughly check the corporate governance track record of the management, searching for any SEBI-related violations, fines, or criminal cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Valuation** Consider the current valuations of the filtered companies before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.
*   **Diversification for Multibaggers** The objective is to identify 20 to 25 stocks, preferably from multiple sectors, to mitigate the risk of industry-wide disruption and increase the chances of finding one or two [[multibaggers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

## Limitations and Trade-offs
*   **Missing New Opportunities** The strategy's focus on businesses with 10+ years of operational history means investors might miss out on catching new companies and industries in their infancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. This implies potentially missing out on early-stage, huge [[multibaggers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

## Implementation Options
*   **Do-It-Yourself (DIY)**: While not overly difficult, the process requires dedication to apply the necessary filters and conduct in-depth research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
*   **Professional Portfolio Management Services (PMS)**: Firms like Ambit and Maraslos offer portfolios that align with the [[professional_portfolio_management_services_offering_coffee_can_investment_strategies | coffee can approach]], such as Ambit's "Coffee Can Portfolio" or Maraslos' "Consistent Compounders Portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. However, these services typically require a minimum investment size of at least 50 lakh rupees, making them unsuitable for most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
*   **Publicly Available Tools**:
    *   **Mutual Funds**: A search across thousands of mutual fund schemes did not yield any explicitly labeled "coffee can" or "consistent compounders" funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Smallcase**: A search on Smallcase also did not directly yield a "coffee can" portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Screener Platforms (e.g., Screener.in)**: While platforms like Screener.in offer over 4,000 user-generated "coffee can" portfolios, they often have limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. For example, a screener may not be able to identify companies that have exceeded 10% growth *in all 10 years* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. Such platforms typically rely on average growth rates rather than year-on-year growth, which can lead to over 100 stocks needing further manual filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Forums and Social Media**: Platforms like ValuePicker and Twitter can be sources for shared knowledge and user-generated stock lists aligned with the coffee can approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Management
*   **No Churning/Rebalancing**: A crucial aspect of the strategy is to avoid churning or rebalancing the portfolio once the stocks are selected, to minimize transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This "don't do anything" approach is a core part of the [[stepbystep_guide_to_building_a_coffee_can_investing_portfolio | coffee can investing process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_and_lessons_in_investing | challenges]], the strategy is designed to perform well across economic cycles and has generally outperformed benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. Investors should consider allocating a maximum of 10% of their portfolio to this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.

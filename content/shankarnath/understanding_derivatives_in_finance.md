Some people have a fear of certain things, but the speaker describes having "ethnophobia," which began in 2001 with the [[developing_a_model_for_investment_returns | Black-Scholes option pricing model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This model calculates its formula by multiplying the stock price by the cumulative standard normal probability distribution function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## What is a Derivative?

A derivative is a type of financial contract whose value depends on an underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For instance, Nifty Futures are a derivative contract that derives its value from the Nifty 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The term "derivative" comes from the Latin word "derivare," meaning "obtained from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Derivatives can obtain their value from various underlying assets, including single stocks, indices like Nifty 50, commodities (e.g., coffee, crude oil, gold), or even real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) released by the Reserve Bank of India is an example of a derivative instrument that derives its value from the price of physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Why Retail Investors Use Derivatives

Traditionally, investing involves identifying undervalued stocks, investing in them, waiting for the price to increase, and then making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, [[basics_of_futures_and_options | Futures and options]] (F&O) expand possibilities for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. With F&O, investors can potentially make money when the market goes up, when it goes down, or even when it remains relatively flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This flexibility is a significant incentive for participating in F&O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Size of the Derivatives Market

Despite the perception that derivatives might be small, the derivatives market is massive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. It is the biggest asset class in the world, with a global market size of 700 trillion dollars, vastly exceeding the market capitalization of individual companies, the cryptocurrency market, the global gold market, global equity markets, and even the cumulative value of the world's real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Types of Derivatives

There are many types of derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Specific to equities, there are five types of contracts: forwards, futures, options, warrants, and swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. In some countries, like India, forwards, warrants, and swaps are not as popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, so the focus is often on futures and options.

## [[how_futures_contracts_work | Futures Contracts]]

A [[how_futures_contracts_work | Futures Contract]] is a legal agreement for the purchase or sale of a physical asset or security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. It specifies a predetermined price and a time in the future for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Example: Coffee Beans

Consider Nestle, which sells coffee. The price of its raw material, coffee beans, can be highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. To ensure price predictability, Nestle and a coffee bean producer might enter into a Futures Contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. For example, they could agree on a price of 10,000 rupees per bag for coffee beans to be delivered three months from now, irrespective of the market price at that future date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This effectively locks in the price for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Typically, no money is exchanged at the time of agreement, except for an initial margin that the seller might request to reduce [[risk_management_in_investing | the risk]] of non-payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

Futures Contracts are commonly used in agriculture, energy products, metals, currencies, and financial products like indices, bonds, ETFs, and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Futures in a Trading Platform

When looking at stocks like ICICI Bank on a trading platform, an investor might see three future options: the current month's contract (e.g., March Futures Contract), and contracts for the next two months (e.g., April and May) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. These contracts expire on the last Thursday of their respective months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. When a current month's contract expires, a new one for a future month (e.g., June) is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

If an investor is interested in the April Futures Contract for ICICI Bank, and it's available at 845 rupees while a share of ICICI Bank is currently priced at 836 rupees, it means that regardless of the actual share price on the April expiry date, the shares will be traded at 845 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The essence of a Futures Contract is locking in a future price for a future date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Making Money with Futures

Making money from a Futures Contract is similar to stock transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>:
*   **Selling Before Expiry**: If the price of the future goes above the agreed 845 rupees, an investor can sell it (or "square off" the position) and make a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Conversely, selling at a lower price than 845 results in a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **At Expiration**: On the expiry day, if the "spot price" (actual share price) of ICICI Bank goes up to, for example, 870 rupees, the Futures price will also rise to a similar number, resulting in a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. If the share price falls, a loss occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Futures Contract Quantity and Margin

Unlike shares, which can be bought individually, Futures must be bought in a "lot" â€“ a bunch of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This is because Futures were not originally designed for retail investors, and standardizing the lot size helps traders understand pricing, [[risk_management_in_investing | risk]], and trade costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. For ICICI Bank, the current Futures lot size is 700 shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

An investor does not have to pay the full contract value (e.g., 5.9 lakhs for 700 shares at 845 rupees each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Instead, a partial amount called a "margin" is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The margin acts like an advance amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, ensuring the contracting party honors their side of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. For example, a margin of 1.09 lakh rupees might be required, which is about 18% of the contract value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Options Contracts

Options are a type of financial derivative that grants its holder the *right*, but not the *obligation*, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price and date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Example: Nestle and Coffee Beans

Using the Nestle coffee bean example, Nestle might offer a token amount, say 5 lakh rupees, to the coffee bean producer, effectively locking in a deal to purchase coffee beans worth 1 crore rupees within two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This 5 lakh rupees is an options contract, providing Nestle flexibility based on the coffee price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Call Options

A call option gives its buyer the *right*, but not the *obligation*, to buy an agreed quantity of a commodity or financial instrument from the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. It has a specific "expiration date" and is set for a "strike price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. For this right, the buyer pays a small fee called a "premium" to the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

**Applying this to Nestle's scenario (as the option buyer):**
*   Nestle paid a 5 lakh rupee premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a> for the right (but not obligation) to buy coffee beans for 1 crore rupees within two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Scenario 1: Price goes up.** If the coffee price rises to 1.5 crores, Nestle would exercise its call option, buying at 1 crore and saving 45 lakhs (1.5 crores - 1 crore - 5 lakh premium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Scenario 2: Price goes down.** If the coffee price falls to 70 lakhs, Nestle would not exercise the option, simply walking away and buying at the lower market price, saving 25 lakhs (1 crore - 70 lakhs) minus the premium cost of 5 lakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Scenario 3: Price remains flat.** If the price stays at 1 crore, Nestle would again not exercise the option, having spent only the premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
From the coffee bean producer's (option seller's) perspective, they make money from the transaction if the price stays at the same level (they keep the premium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Put Options

A put option is the reverse of a call option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. A put option buyer anticipates a fall in the price of the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> and wants to retain the right to sell it at a higher price until the expiry date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

### Option Strategies

There are four foundational paths for any option strategy, involving buying or selling a call option or a put option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. An investor's choice depends on their market view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>:
*   **Bullish Market View**: Buy a call option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a> or sell a put option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Bearish Market View**: Sell a call option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a> or buy a put option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

Understanding derivatives can be complex and may require further study to fully grasp their inner workings and various trading strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Popular stock futures include those for Reliance, Tata Steel, and HDFC Bank, in addition to Nifty Futures and Bank Nifty Futures, which are traded in huge volumes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

When engaging in a [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | Stock Lending and Borrowing Mechanism (SLBM)]] transaction, it's important to understand the associated charges and tax implications.

## Charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>

As per current norms, several typical charges associated with securities trading are **not** applicable to [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] trades:
*   Securities Transaction Tax (STT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>
*   SEBI turnover charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>
*   Stamp Duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>
*   Transaction charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>

### Brokerage Commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>
Brokerage commissions for [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] transactions are not uniform and vary between different brokerages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>
*   For example, Zerodha charges 20% of the lending fees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>
*   Kotak Securities and HDFC Securities charge 15% of the lending fees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>

Importantly, brokerage is calculated on the *lending fees earned*, not on the actual value of the shares transacted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>

### Goods and Services Tax (GST)
In addition to brokerage commissions, GST (currently 18%) is also deducted from the lending fees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>

## Taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>

### No Capital Gains Tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>
When shares are moved from a lender's demat account to a borrower's account in an [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] transaction, it is not considered a transfer or sale of securities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> This means that no capital gain taxes are payable on the transfer itself. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>

### Income from Other Sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>
The lending fee received by the lender is typically categorized as "income from other sources." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> This income is added to the lender's total taxable income and is taxed according to their applicable income tax slab. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>

The net lending fee, after deducting commissions and GST, is credited to the lender's savings account upon the expiry of the [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] contract. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>

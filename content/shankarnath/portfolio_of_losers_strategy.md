The [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian investing strategy]] involves opposing popular opinion and doing the opposite of what the crowd is doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. One prominent [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian technique]] is the **portfolio of losers strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Concept
This strategy involves intentionally investing in stocks that have performed poorly or experienced significant price declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The core principle is going against the crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

The implicit assumptions behind this strategy are:
*   Stocks that have seen a significant price decline may have been oversold due to negative news, market panic, or other short-term factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   There is an expectation of a reversal of trends, where these stocks will become attractive to investors again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Defining a "Loser"
A consensual definition for a "loser" stock is one that has experienced at least a 40% drop in its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Examples of Indian companies meeting this definition in the past year (as of the video's creation) include Adani Total Gas, Poly Plex, Barbeque Nation, and Balajiya Means, which saw sharp drops despite the Nifty going up by 11.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Performance Analysis
### US Market Data
Professor Ashwath Damodaran's book *Investment Fables* cites an analysis suggesting that if an investor bought the 35 biggest losers over the previous year and held them for the next five years, they would have generated:
*   A cumulative excess return of 30% over the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   An extra 40% when compared to an investment in a "winners' portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Indian Market Data
An exercise conducted for the Indian stock market, by identifying the worst-performing stocks for two years prior to August 2018, created a portfolio of 35 Indian loser stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Over a five-year period, this portfolio yielded a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 91% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A significant portion of this return came from four specific stocks: Orchid Pharma, Best Agrolife, Patanjali Foods, and Raj Rayon Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

After removing the top four and bottom four outlier performers, a revised portfolio of 27 loser stocks still provided a five-year CAGR of 31% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. During the same period, the Nifty grew by 11.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, resulting in an alpha of almost 20% every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. An initial investment of 1 lakh rupees in August 2018 would have grown to almost 4 lakhs by the time of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

For comparison, a "winners' portfolio" of 27 stocks in the Indian market, after removing outliers, yielded a five-year CAGR of 19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This was still 8% more than the Nifty's performance but significantly lower than the revised losers' portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Practical Application
To create a 35-stock portfolio of losers today, one would identify companies that have experienced significant price declines, ideally at least 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Distinction: Cheap vs. Undervalued Companies
It's a common misconception that a [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian]] only invests in stocks with a low Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. It is crucial to differentiate between a "cheap" company and an "undervalued" company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>:
*   **Cheap company**: One that possesses favorable metrics like a low P/E ratio, high dividend yield, and low price-to-book ratio, but it might remain cheap indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Undervalued opportunity**: A great business experiencing temporary headwinds or negative news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Investing in these temporary setbacks within great businesses is a superior strategy compared to focusing on permanently cheap businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Examples include Infosys in 2016 or Maruti Suzuki in 2018, both of which recovered and led to substantial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

## Benefits
A [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian strategy]], like the portfolio of losers, can lead to:
*   Higher portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   Reduction in volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   Less overreaction to market developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   Better diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

Success in this strategy requires patience, discipline, conviction, and superior research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

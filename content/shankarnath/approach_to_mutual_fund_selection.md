Picking a mutual fund is a frequent question that lacked sufficient guidance in the past, leading many to rely on various advisors, bankers, YouTubers, and relatives [00:00:00]. This article outlines a personal approach to [[improving_stock_and_mutual_fund_selection | mutual fund selection]] based on experience and a specific worldview [00:00:20]. The focus is primarily on equity funds, excluding debt funds [00:00:35].

## Current Mutual Fund Landscape
As of the video's recording, there are 1,147 open-ended schemes across 36 categories available for investment [00:00:40]. It can be challenging to choose even a few schemes, and there's a temptation to invest in many [00:00:48]. The speaker admits to currently being invested in 70 schemes, which they consider a mistake and are working to reduce, though taxation complexities with debt schemes make this difficult [00:00:57].

## Core Principles for Mutual Fund Selection

### 1. Asset Allocation Clarity
It is crucial to be clear about your asset allocation mix [00:01:16]. Mutual funds should not be chosen randomly but should align with your desired asset allocation [00:01:18]. The speaker's personal comfortable mix, after much experimentation, is around 65-35 equity to non-equity [00:01:30]. This allocation is flexible, with equity ranging from 45% to 75% depending on market conditions, aiming for comfort and "sleeping well" rather than massive returns [00:01:45].

As of the video's recording, the speaker's portfolio is 58% equity and 42% non-equity (mostly debt and some gold) [00:02:25], simplified to a 60/40 ratio for discussion [00:02:36].

#### Equity Sub-Allocation
Within the equity portion (60%), the comfortable split is:
*   **Large Caps**: 50% [00:02:53] – Provides stability to the portfolio [00:03:00].
*   **Mid Caps**: 20% [00:02:56] – Acts as a fertile ground for "multibaggers" [00:03:05].
*   **Small Caps**: 20% [00:02:56] – Also for "multibaggers" [00:03:08].
*   **International Investments**: 10% [00:02:58] – Satisfies diversification needs [00:03:11].

On an overall portfolio basis, this translates to:
*   30% in Large Caps [00:03:17]
*   12% each in Mid and Small Caps [00:03:19]
*   6% in International Funds [00:03:23]
*   40% in Debt [00:03:25]

This specific mix is a "comfort zone" and is expected to differ for other investors based on income, savings, risk profile, and investment patterns [00:03:28].

### 2. What Not to Do (Common Mistakes)
Investors should be mindful of common mistakes, which the speaker has detailed in another video [00:03:59]. Generally, caution is advised before:
*   Investing in SIPs via regular plans [00:04:23]
*   Investing through the NFO (New Fund Offer) process [00:04:26]
*   Using sectoral funds [00:04:28]
*   Investing in credit risk funds [00:04:30]
*   Investing in debt funds with low AUM (Assets Under Management) [00:04:31]

### 3. Focus on the Fund Manager
Since an equity fund is a basket of stocks over which investors have no control, [[selecting_mutual_funds_for_a_lifetime_portfolio | picking a fund]] is primarily about picking the fund manager [00:04:40]. Limited information is available on this subject, but investors can learn a lot by reading and listening to interviews given by fund managers [00:05:01].

#### Understanding Investing Styles
It is crucial to understand the investing style of the fund manager and make it part of your own identity rather than just treating it as a statistic [00:06:09].
*   **Prashant Jain (formerly CIO of HDFC Mutual Fund)**: Believes strongly in value investing, evident from his interviews often featuring terms like "margin of safety," "risk and reward," "herd behavior," and "intrinsic value" [00:05:19]. Value investing faced challenges from 2018-2020 but was rewarding in 2021-2022 [00:06:27].
*   **Jinesh Gopani (Heads Equities for Axis Mutual Funds)**: Prefers the growth style of investing, using terms like "earnings growth," "long-term story," "growth runway," and "P multiplier" in his interviews [00:05:37]. Growth strategies excelled from 2018-2020 but have struggled more recently [00:06:51].

Investing styles, like sectors and companies, tend to work in cycles [00:06:38]. Fund managers are unlikely to abandon their identified styles, which provides comfort to investors as they know what to expect and can shape their portfolios accordingly [00:07:01].

### 4. Consistency over Historical Returns
Instead of focusing too much on historical returns (1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, trailing, or rolling returns), a larger focus should be placed on consistency over the benchmark [00:07:36].

#### The "2-2-1" Approach
As part of the [[strategies_for_enhancing_mutual_fund_returns | Equity Fund selection process]], the speaker follows a "2-2-1" rule [00:08:04]:
*   In the last five years, the scheme was **well above the benchmark** in two years [00:08:09].
*   It was **somewhat around the benchmark** for another two years [00:08:14].
*   It may have been **below the benchmark** in one year [00:08:16].

This approach helps prevent the use of only recent information in evaluating a fund and improves long-term performance odds by selecting funds with a decent track record [00:08:31].

### 5. Sector Concentration
When selecting potential equity schemes, it's important to understand *how many* sectors the fund is betting on [00:08:58]. It's acceptable if a fund focuses on just five or six sectors, reflecting the fund manager's conviction [00:09:05]. However, funds betting on only one sector or an excessive number like 15 different sectors should be avoided [00:09:15].

### 6. Expense Ratio
While not a stickler for the absolute lowest expense ratio, the speaker prefers a "reasonable" number [00:09:25]. Anything less than one percent is considered acceptable, as it provides sufficient incentive for the fund management team to perform their job well, ensuring they don't cut corners on information collection, analyst recruitment, or stock research [00:09:30].

### 7. Role of Passive Funds
Passive funds have become a significant part of the speaker's investment strategy in recent years [00:09:50]. Currently, almost half of the SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) are in passive funds, with the other half in actively managed ones [00:09:54]. However, actively managed funds still account for about 80% of the total asset value, a percentage expected to gradually decrease over time [00:10:01].

## Speaker's Current SIP Strategy
Despite past mistakes resulting in 28 different equity schemes, the speaker's nine current SIPs are chosen to align with their asset allocation preferences [00:10:18].
*   **Large Caps (30% of total portfolio)**: No actively managed large cap funds are currently held. Instead, investments include a factor-based fund, a flexi-cap fund, a [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | multi-cap fund]] (noted as a favorite category), and an ELSS fund [00:10:38].
*   **Mid Caps**: One SIP from a factor-based scheme and another actively managed mid-cap fund [00:10:56].
*   **Small Caps**: Invested through an actively managed small-cap fund [00:11:03].
*   **International Funds**: One actively managed fund and another index-based international fund [00:11:08].

The names of specific funds are not disclosed, as the aim is to provide a customizable framework rather than direct recommendations [00:11:15]. Many of these SIPs have been held for over five years, with no current reason to exit [00:11:33].

## Long-Term Perspective
Data suggests that the longer an investor stays in a fund, the less significant the scheme's original selection becomes [00:11:42]. For example, a table of flexi-cap funds showed that, excluding the [[quant_mutual_fund_investment_strategy | Quant flexi-cap]] (an outlier), the next nine schemes' 10-year SIP performance differed by only 1.5% to 2% [00:11:49]. This data-driven information reinforces the focus on asset allocation fit, fund manager's investing style, performance consistency, and avoiding problematic funds, rather than being swayed by historical returns [00:12:05].

The ultimate goal is to provide a framework for investors to make informed decisions themselves, rather than relying on a list of specific funds [00:12:53].

Ambit Capital has developed a portfolio selection strategy known as the "10 Bagger Portfolio," which has achieved an annualized return of 22% over 11 years, converting one rupee into nine rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This strategy is based on a "Greatness Framework" designed to identify companies with strong structural strengths that can potentially become [[concept_of_100_bagger_stocks | 10-bagger stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## Ambit Capital's Greatness Framework

The Greatness Framework, initially released in 2012 by Gaurav Mehta and Saurabh Mukherjee, has evolved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. It focuses on how a company consistently improves its structural strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

The framework assesses companies based on six foundational blocks, which are then equally weighted to generate a "greatness score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>:

1.  **Investment (Incremental Capex)**: This is measured by the improvement in the capital expenditure to depreciation ratio over a six-year period (recent three years divided by past three years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* Balakrishna Industries, Coromandel International, and Page Industries have increased funds towards manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
2.  **Efficiency in Converting Investments to Sales**: This factor assesses how efficiently a firm translates investments into sales. While earlier versions considered asset turnover ratio and sales growth, recent presentations focus on incremental sales growth measured against its standard deviation to ensure consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* Deepak Nitrite, Gland Pharma, and SRF Limited significantly increased sales from FY 2020-22 compared to FY 2017-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
3.  **Efficiency in Capital Employed**: Measured as an improvement in the capital employed turnover ratio, which is calculated by dividing a company's sales by its average capital employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
4.  **Pricing Discipline**: Refers to the improvement in PBIT (Profit Before Interest and Tax) margins. Ambit assesses growth in margins over a six-year block and checks for consistency against standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
5.  **Balance Sheet Discipline**: Examines a company's de-leverage ratio, specifically how much the debt-equity ratio has been reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
6.  **Cash Generation and Profitability Improvement**: Measured by an increase in the company's cash flow from operations and its consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

### Exclusions and Company Examples
This framework explicitly excludes financial institutions such as banks, NBFCs, and insurance companies. Therefore, the "10 Bagger" list typically includes manufacturing, IT, pharma, and services companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

Persistent Systems, for instance, received a greatness score of 100 from Ambit Capital, demonstrating higher capex, increased sales, consistent profit margins, and a significant jump in cash flow from operations in 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

## Actionable Criteria for "Great Companies"

Ambit's 2023 presentation outlines specific growth targets that distinguish a "great" company:
*   Sales growth: At least 15% over the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
*   Cash from operations (CFO) growth: At least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   Profit After Tax (PAT) growth: At least 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
*   Return on Capital (ROC): 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.

## Ambit's 10-Bagger Ideas and Performance

Ambit provides two lists of potential 10-bagger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>:
1.  **Within the BSE 500 Universe**: Companies with a market capitalization of at least 5000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
2.  **Beyond the BSE 500**: Often referred to as micro caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

These lists include specifics on sales growth, return on capital employed, and accounting scores (related to internal fraud and governance checks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

The performance of these portfolios has been strong:
*   BSE 500 picks: Delivered a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   Sub-BSE 500 selections: Delivered an even higher CAGR of 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

## Valuation Considerations

Beyond identifying structurally strong companies, it's crucial to determine if it's the right time to buy their shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Ambit's model addresses this by examining:
*   Current Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

If these current ratios are below their historical five-year average, Ambit's model considers the stocks to be cheap and attractively priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

*   **Attractively Priced (as of Feb 10, 2023):** Ultratech, Dr. Reddy's, Gland Pharma, Indiamart, CAMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   **Deemed Expensive (as of Feb 10, 2023):** SRF, Balakrishna Industries, Tata ELXSI, Persistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Revisions and Consistency

The "10 Bagger" framework is not a fixed, one-time selection. Portfolio revisions are made annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. It has been observed that only about 35% of the companies initially qualifying for the list continue to do so over the subsequent two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

Out of over 100 companies identified by Ambit's framework, only five have been consistently listed as 10-baggers: Nestle India, Hindalco Industries, Abbott India, Page Industries, and Tata ELXSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. This highlights the need for ongoing investor work to maintain a portfolio aligned with the framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

## Summary of 10-Step Stock Screener for Multibagger Stocks

To apply Ambit Capital's 10-bagger framework using a stock screener, consider these ten points, which form a comprehensive [[investment_strategies_using_stock_screeners | investment strategy]]:

1.  **Increasing Capital Expenditure**: Look for companies incrementally increasing their capex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
2.  **Sales Growth**: Companies must demonstrate consistent growth in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
3.  **Efficient Capital Usage**: Identify companies that generate revenue while efficiently using their capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
4.  **Improving Profit Margins**: Seek firms that are improving their profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
5.  **Decreasing Debt-Equity Ratio**: Companies whose debt-equity ratio is consistently coming down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
6.  **Increasing Cash Flow from Operations**: Companies where cash flow from operations is increasing along with profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
7.  **Consistency Check**: All the above points should be checked for consistency over two blocks of three years (total six years), factoring in standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
8.  **Dividend Reinvestment**: The model assumes that any dividends received from the stock are reinvested back on the ex-dividend date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.
9.  **Accounting and Governance Check**: Filter out companies with corporate governance issues, questionable auditor reports, or high percentages of promoter-pledged shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
10. **Attractive Valuation**: Select stocks that are attractively valued compared to their historical valuations, by examining current P/E, P/B, and EV/EBITDA ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

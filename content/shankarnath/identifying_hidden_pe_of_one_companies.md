A **PE of one** occurs when a company's share price is equal to or less than its earnings per share (EPS) over the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. However, the concept of a "hidden PE of one" refers to companies that currently have a high PE ratio but are very likely to have future per-share earnings higher than their current price per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. According to Mr. Pabrai, holding a "bunch of stocks at a PE of one" generally leads to positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Understanding the PE Ratio
The [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] is a widely discussed [[evaluating_stocks_using_peg_and_pe_ratios | valuation metric]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. It's calculated by dividing the present price by past earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. However, this approach can be illogical because a company's future earnings are what truly determine the return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

### Why Focus on Hidden PE of One?
The core idea is that if a company's future earnings per share are projected to significantly outpace its current share price, it effectively trades at a very low future PE, potentially even a PE of one. For example, if a company currently has a PE of 112, like Avenue Supermarts (DMART), but grows its earnings by 25% annually, it could theoretically reach a PE of one in 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Reaching a PE of one can be an "excruciatingly difficult and time-consuming exercise" for many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## Key Learnings for Identifying Hidden PE of One Companies
There are four primary factors to consider when identifying companies with a hidden PE of one:

1.  **Profit Growth**: The main variable is profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Companies growing profits by more than 20% are more likely to reach a hidden PE of one, even if their current PE ratio is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Starting PE Ratio**: The initial [[factors_affecting_pe_ratios | valuation]] matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. A company growing at 10% but starting with a PE of 10 may reach a PE of one faster than a company growing at 20% but starting with a PE of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. A low starting [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] significantly improves the chances of reaching a PE of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Time Horizon**: An ideal hidden PE of one company should have visibility within a maximum of five to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Multi-decade plans are less exciting due to potential disruptions like competition, changing consumer demand, technology, natural calamities, or regulatory changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
4.  **Market Capitalization**: A hidden PE of one might be more commonly found in mid- and small-cap companies rather than large-cap ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Screening and Practical Considerations
Standard stock screeners, even with good combinations of PE ratio and earnings growth, often yield companies with high debt levels, unstable operating margins, or corporate governance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

Finding a PE of one company is an infrequent phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. While using a stock screener is acceptable, caution is advised for cyclical businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Cyclical businesses:
*   Should not offer visibility beyond one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.
*   Have volatile [[factors_affecting_pe_ratios | PE ratios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   Their price is more determined by demand/supply gaps than earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

When identifying hidden PE of one stocks, focus on direct parameters like sales growth, profit growth, and operating margins, and give extra consideration to companies with pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

[[identifying_turnaround_stocks | Turnaround stocks]] can also fit the hidden PE of one criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. These are good companies currently in trouble, but with a small capital infusion and good talent, they can return to normalcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Alibaba Group Holdings Limited
Alibaba, a popular Chinese company, appears to have a hidden PE of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Despite an 80% drop in market valuations from its all-time high and ongoing geopolitical and regulatory headwinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, the company remains highly profitable and trades at very low [[evaluating_stocks_using_peg_and_pe_ratios | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

### Valuation Analysis
*   **Current Price**: One share traded at $65 at the time of recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   **Net Cash Position**: $70 billion, equating to about $10 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Cash-Adjusted Price**: $55 per share ($65 - $10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   **Projected EPS (FY23)**: Consensus estimate of $7.11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
*   **Cash-Adjusted PE (FY23)**: 7.7 ($55 / $7.11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   **Projected EPS (Next Five Years)**: Expected to grow to $14.29 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **Cash-Adjusted PE (Next Five Years)**: 3.8 ($55 / $14.29) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

### Economic vs. Accounting Earnings
Alibaba's numbers reveal a deeper hidden value by looking at economic earnings (Free Cash Flow) versus accounting earnings (EPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Alibaba's free cash flow numbers have averaged 40% higher than its EPS numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

*   **Reconstructed Hidden EPS (FY28)**: $20 ($14.29 + 40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
*   **Hidden PE (Cash-Adjusted, FY28)**: 2.75 ($55 / $20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

This demonstrates how a deeper examination can reveal a company is much closer to a "PE of one" target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. Finding a "bunch of 1P or even 2P stocks" can significantly contribute to wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

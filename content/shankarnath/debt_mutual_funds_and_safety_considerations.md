[[understanding_debt_mutual_funds_and_bond_investments | Debt mutual funds]] are presented as a viable option for parking money, especially during uncertain market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Given their varying forms, selecting the most suitable one can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Selection Criteria

When considering [[approach_to_mutual_fund_selection | debt mutual funds]], the selection process primarily focuses on two variables: safety and interest rate sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### Safety

Certain [[understanding_debt_mutual_funds_and_bond_investments | debt mutual fund]] instruments are considered safer due to their lower credit risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. These include:
*   Liquid funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>
*   Overnight funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>
*   Money market funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>
*   Government bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>

In contrast, funds that invest in 'A' or lower-rated papers, such as credit risk funds, carry a higher credit risk and thus lower safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. When exploring a pure play [[understanding_debt_mutual_funds_and_bond_investments | debt fund]], always prioritize safety and interest rate sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

### Interest Rate Sensitivity

Another key variable is interest rate sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Funds with lower duration, like liquid and ultra short-term schemes, are less affected by changes in RBI's repo rates compared to long-duration funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. For parking money for 6 to 12 months, short duration schemes like money market and ultrashort duration funds are generally sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

## Taxation of Debt Mutual Funds

Historically, [[understanding_debt_mutual_funds_and_bond_investments | debt funds]] offered a taxation benefit on long-term capital gains, but this is no longer available since April of last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## Deploying Parked Money

Once market clarity emerges, money parked in [[understanding_debt_mutual_funds_and_bond_investments | debt mutual funds]] can be deployed into equity schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. A common method is the Systematic Transfer Plan (STP), where money is moved from the [[understanding_debt_mutual_funds_and_bond_investments | debt fund]] or hybrid fund into a pure equity fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

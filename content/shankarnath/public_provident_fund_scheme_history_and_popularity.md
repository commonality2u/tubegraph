The Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme was introduced in 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Since its inception, it has grown significantly, with over 25 crore PPF accounts opened, holding a collective balance of approximately 14 lakh crore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Reasons for Popularity

The scheme is exceptionally popular due to several key features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   Its tax-free status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   Guaranteed returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Its long-term investment horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

These attributes make the PPF a "very clean, clear, and useful financial instrument" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### [[triple_e_tax_benefits_of_ppf | Triple E Tax Benefits]]

A major draw of the PPF is its adherence to the [[triple_e_tax_benefits_of_ppf | Triple E]] (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) model of taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:
1.  **Exempt (Contribution)**: Contributions made to the PPF are eligible for tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  **Exempt (Interest)**: The interest earned on the PPF account balance is completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  **Exempt (Maturity/Withdrawal)**: All maturity proceeds are exempted from capital gains or wealth tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This triple benefit also applies to partial withdrawals and premature closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

This tax structure makes PPF a "must-have" for risk-averse individuals in the 30% tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For example, to match the 8% tax-free returns offered by PPF, a debt mutual fund would need to consistently yield 11.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) Caveat
> A rule introduced in 2021 states that if a person has not filed income tax returns in the previous three years, a TDS ranging from 2% to 5% will apply to withdrawals exceeding a certain limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

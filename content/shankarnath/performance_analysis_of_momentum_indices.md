Investment styles often define fund managers, with many finding it difficult to transition between approaches like value or growth investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While traditional value investing focuses on identifying gaps between value and price and applying a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, which can create mental boundaries, momentum investing is another concept that has gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Understanding Momentum in Investing

In investing, momentum refers to the tendency for investments that have performed well to continue doing so, and similarly, for poorly performing stocks to continue performing poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This means investing in a stock that has already gone up significantly, which can seem counterintuitive to those trained in value investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The study of momentum as an investment strategy began in the 1990s with researchers like Fama, French, and Jagdish Moskowitz, who observed that momentum delivered returns often higher than market cap or value style funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. One explanation for this anomaly comes from behavioral finance, suggesting investors tend to overreact or underreact to information, causing stock prices to shoot up or depress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These distortions tend to reduce over the long term, which is why momentum investing is often viewed as a short-term strategy, typically played out over a 3 to 6-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## [[construction_of_a_momentum_stocks_portfolio | Building a Simple Momentum Portfolio]]

A portfolio of momentum stocks can be constructed with minimal investing knowledge, primarily requiring standard screening software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. A simple three-step process for [[construction_of_a_momentum_stocks_portfolio | building a momentum portfolio]] includes:
1.  **Define the universe**: For mid-caps, this might involve applying a market cap range (e.g., 25 to 75,000 crores), yielding a diverse set of stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
2.  **Sort stocks**: Arrange these stocks in descending order based on their share price return over the past 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
3.  **Select top performers**: Pick the top 10 stocks from this sorted list to form the momentum portfolio for the next 3 to 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Example Performance
A hypothetical portfolio constructed using August data from the previous year delivered a 34% point-to-point return over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This significantly outperformed the Nifty 50 (11%) and the Midcap 150 (26%) over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Performance of Momentum Indices in India

While the above example shows strong performance, it's important to analyze [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | performance comparison with market indices]] over longer periods. The Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index serves as a useful reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index Performance
On an overall basis, the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index has generally outperformed the Nifty in most years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Highly Profitable Years**: 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2021, and notably 2023, where it delivered 23% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Poor Performance Years**: 2018 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Market Conditions**: The momentum index performs well during market uptrends but struggles in flat or bearish markets, sometimes delivering negative returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This highlights that momentum accelerates returns in bullish markets but faces challenges when markets are range-bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Key Indian Momentum Indices
India offers specific [[performance_analysis_of_indian_index_funds | Indian Index Funds]] to participate in the momentum opportunity:
*   **Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index**: Composed mostly of large-cap stocks (70-75%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index**: Consists entirely of mid-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Both these indices have performed exceptionally well:
*   **5-year CAGR**: The Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index delivered 23%, and the Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index delivered 32% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Nifty 50**: Over the same 5-year period, the Nifty 50 returned only 16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Monetary Impact**: An investment of ₹1 lakh in the Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index in January 2019 would have grown to over ₹4 lakh, nearly double the ₹2.1 lakh from an equivalent investment in the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Participating in Momentum Investing

Investors can participate in momentum strategies through several avenues:

### Passively Managed Funds
*   **Mutual Funds and ETFs**: Available for both the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 and Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Selection Criteria**: When choosing, consider brand preference, expense ratio (should not be too high or too low), and Assets Under Management (AUM), ideally above ₹100 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Actively Managed Offerings
*   **Mutual Funds**: Examples include the Samco Active Momentum Fund and the Quant AMC Momentum Fund, which use proprietary models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Smallcases and PMS Offerings**: Many smallcases are built around different momentum strategies, with offerings from firms like Right Research, Capital Mind, Weekend Investing, and Windmill Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. These have varying methodologies, fee structures, and performance metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Passive vs. Active Momentum Funds
There are distinct differences between passive and active momentum investment instruments:

| Feature           | Passive (Index Funds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>                                  | Active (Samco, Quant, Smallcases, PMS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>                                          |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universe**      | Restricted to large caps or mid-caps with a defined number of stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> | Broader mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>                                                      |
| **Investment Style** | Always invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>                                               | Tend to enter and exit the market based on conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>                 |
| **Rebalancing**   | Fixed and rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>                                                  | Can rebalance as needed, useful during sudden price shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>     |
| **Strategy**      | Primarily use relative momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>                                   | Use a variety of methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>                                               |
| **Expense Structure** | Lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>                                                       | Much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>                                                          |

## Advanced Momentum Techniques

Beyond basic price momentum, several advanced strategies exist:
*   **Price Momentum**: Investing in stocks with strong recent price performance, assuming continuation of the upward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Relative Strength Momentum**: Comparing an asset's performance to its benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Cross-sectional Momentum**: Comparing price movement of two stocks within the same sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Time Series Momentum (Trend Following)**: Another technique tracking trends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Moving Average Momentum**: Used by traders and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **52-Week High Momentum**: Revolves around the idea that stocks at or near their 52-week highs will continue to perform well in the short run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Stock selection involves screening for 52-week highs and applying positive momentum factors like trading volumes, favorable news, or positive earnings surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Combination of Momentum and Value**: Explores the idea that momentum and value factors are weakly correlated, and an equal 50/50 allocation can potentially achieve around 15% per annum on a 3, 5, 7, or 10-year rolling basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This is discussed further in [[performance_analysis_of_momentum_vs_value_funds | performance analysis of momentum vs value funds]] and [[momentum_and_value_index_strategy | Momentum and Value Index Strategy]]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Dual Momentum**: Proposed by Gary Antonacci, it involves two different momentum calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>:
    *   **Absolute Momentum**: Compares a stock's recent price performance to its own historical performance (e.g., current price divided by historical price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   **Relative Momentum**: Compares the stock's performance to a broader benchmark like a sector or an index (e.g., Nifty 50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    These scores are then combined, often with a 50% weight each, to derive a "dual momentum score," which is used to rank and select stocks for the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Samco's momentum fund reportedly utilizes dual momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

Momentum as a strategy is expected to persist, as it continues to capitalize on market trends and deliver significant returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

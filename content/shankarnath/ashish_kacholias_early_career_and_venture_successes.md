He did so in collaboration with prominent figures like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Neeraj Roy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Shift to Stock Market Focus

A significant turning point in Ashish Kacholia's career occurred in 2003, when he shifted his entire focus to stock market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. He carved out a unique niche by concentrating on midcap and small cap stocks, an area that was largely overlooked by most investors at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Known for maintaining a low profile, Kacholia avoids interviews, rarely tweets, and generally steers clear of publicity stunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

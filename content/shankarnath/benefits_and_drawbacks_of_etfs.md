Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are significant financial instruments globally, managing almost $11.5 trillion as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While launched in India in 2002, they remained largely non-existent for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Their growth in India was significantly boosted by government initiatives, including recognition as an asset class in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> and the Employee Provident Fund Organization's (EPFO) decision to invest a portion of its monthly inflows into ETFs, which has since increased from 5% to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. As a result, the asset class grew over 50 times larger from 2015 to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

An [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] is a tradable security that tracks an index, bond, commodity, a bunch of stocks, or any basket of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Key foundational elements of an ETF are its trackability and tradability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, a Nifty50 index ETF closely follows and replicates the Nifty 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, and a [[gold_etfs_as_a_portfolio_diversifier | Gold ETF]]'s value is dependent on the price of the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Benefits of Investing in ETFs

ETFs offer several compelling [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | advantages]] for investors:

### Simplicity and Diversification
ETFs are generally simple to understand due to their structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. They are typically designed as a diversified portfolio, allowing investors to own a piece of many popular stocks within a sector (e.g., FMCG ETF) at a fraction of the cost of buying individual shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Transparency
Most ETFs disclose their holdings daily, and their prices are available in real-time, offering high transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Tradability and Real-Time Pricing
ETFs can be bought and sold on a stock exchange during trading hours, similar to how stocks are traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This real-time pricing allows investors to react quickly to market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Wide Range of Choice and Diversity
Indian investors can choose from almost 200 ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. These are mostly passively managed, providing clear investment objectives and keeping costs low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The diversity of [[different_types_of_etfs_and_investment_strategies | ETFs]] is impressive, covering:
*   **Broader Market ETFs**: Nifty50, Nifty Next50, Nifty Midcap 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   **Thematic ETFs**: Banking, Auto, Pharma, IT, Consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>
*   **Commodity ETFs**: [[gold_etfs_as_a_portfolio_diversifier | Gold]] and Silver ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>
*   **Factor-Based/Smart Beta ETFs**: Momentum, Alpha, Low Volatility, Quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
*   **International ETFs**: NASDAQ, Fang Plus index, Hang Seng <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
*   **Debt-Based ETFs**: Government securities, Bharat bonds, Overnight funds, State Development Loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
An investor can even construct an entire portfolio using only ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Low Expense Structure
ETFs typically have a low expense ratio, often below 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. For instance, in 2023, Nepon India reduced its Nifty50 Bees ETF charge to 0.037%, and ICICI Prudential brought its Nifty50 ETF expense ratio down to 0.0279% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Drawbacks and Concerns of ETFs

While offering numerous benefits, ETFs also come with certain [[investment_considerations_for_liquid_etfs_including_risks_tracking_error_and_taxation | concerns]]:

### Incidental Costs
Despite low expense ratios, investors incur several incidental costs when trading ETFs, including:
*   Broker commission for buying or selling ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
*   Demat charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>
*   Securities Transaction Tax (STT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>
*   SEBI turnover fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>
*   Stamp Duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
*   GST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>
*   Bid-ask spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>
*   Market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
These costs can add up, making it crucial to consider total expenses when comparing ETFs to index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Heavily traded ETFs (like Nifty50 or [[factors_influencing_the_value_and_performance_of_gold_etfs | Gold]]) generally have lower total expenses than thinly traded ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Liquidity Concerns
[[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | Liquidity]] refers to the ease of buying or selling an ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Low-liquidity ETFs pose a risk because there might not be enough corresponding buy or sell orders to execute a transaction when desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. For example, some Nifty50 ETFs have significantly higher trading volumes than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Low liquidity can also lead to wild price swings in an ETF's Net Asset Value (NAV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Investors should be particularly careful about volumes when evaluating thematic, factor-based, or International ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Tracking Error
Tracking error is the standard deviation between the ETF's performance and the performance of its tracking index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. It can be influenced by factors such as:
*   Delay in purchasing or selling securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>
*   ETF's cash holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>
*   Delays in dividend deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>
*   The scheme's expense ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
A smaller tracking error indicates superior index replication and is more attractive to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Impact Cost
Impact cost refers to the potential cost incurred by a buyer or seller due to prevailing liquidity conditions for a specific order quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. It is a measure of liquidity risk, reflecting how much an ETF's market price is influenced by the size of an investor's trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. For example, if a large order is placed, the actual execution price might deviate significantly from the ideal price, leading to a higher impact cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The less liquid a security, the higher the impact cost, which reduces total returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Impact cost can range from 0.03% to 1.3% for Nifty50 ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## ETF vs. Index Funds

[[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | ETFs and index funds]] share similarities: both constitute a portfolio of assets, track an index, have low expenses, and are mostly passively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, key differences exist:

| Feature           | ETFs                                                                      | Index Funds                                                              |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Market Impact** | Investor buys/sells do not directly impact other unit holders; new shares created for buys, existing redeemed for sells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> | Investor buys/sells directly affect all other unit holders as the fund must purchase/redeem underlying securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a> |
| **Tradability**   | Listed on stock exchange, can be bought/sold during market hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a> | Not tradable on a real-time basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>                                       |
| **Demat Account** | Required for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>                                                               | Not needed for investing or redeeming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>                                   |
| **SIPs**          | Some stock brokers offer SIPs for ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>                                          | More aligned with SIPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>                                                       |
| **Tracking Error**| Generally lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>                                                              | Can be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>                                                               |
| **Total Costs**   | Expense ratio is low, but incidental costs (demat, STT, impact cost, etc.) add up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> | May appear more expensive due to higher expense ratio, but fewer incidental costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> |
| **Liquidity**     | Can be an issue for less liquid ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>                                          | Fund house honors every buy and sell order, so liquidity is not an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a> |

## Practical Applications of ETFs

ETFs can be used strategically in investing:
*   **Tactical Opportunities**: Useful during sharp market dips (e.g., Sensex/Nifty drops) for profitable index buying, as the real-time trading allows immediate action that may not be possible with index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Such opportunities arise not just in broader markets but also across sectors like banking, IT, pharma, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Expense Ratio Differences**: Preferred when the expense ratio between an ETF and its corresponding index fund or fund of funds is significantly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Access to Specific Markets/Factors**: When an international index or a particular factor is only available via an ETF and not as an index fund or fund of fund option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## How to Invest in ETFs

Like company shares, ETFs have a primary and a secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Primary Market**: Initial allocation of ETF units, similar to a mutual fund NFO (New Fund Offer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Secondary Market**: Once initial allotment is done, the ETF is listed on the stock exchange, and further purchases or sales happen here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

To buy and sell ETFs, you need a trading account (with a broker like Zerodha, ICICI Direct, MStock, Groww, Upstox) and a demat account (with NSDL or CDSL) for holding the units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Each ETF is identified by a specific symbol on the trading platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## Other Important Considerations

### Dividend Reinvestment
Dividends received by an ETF on its underlying shares are typically reinvested back into the scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Prompt reinvestment by the ETF issuer is crucial to minimize tracking error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### Taxation
[[understanding_etf_costs_and_taxation | ETF returns]] are primarily from dividend income and capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

#### Dividend Income
Any dividend income received is added to the investor's annual income and taxed according to their income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

#### Capital Gains
Taxation on capital gains depends on the type of asset class and the holding period:
*   **Equity ETFs**: Similar to equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
    *   **Short-Term Capital Gain (STCG)**: If held for less than 12 months, taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
    *   **Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG)**: If held beyond a year and earnings exceed ₹1 lakh, gains are subject to a 10% tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Non-Equity ETFs (Gold, Debt, International ETFs)**: Post April 2023 amendment in the finance bill, these are taxed at the existing income tax slab rate, irrespective of the holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
*   **Asset Allocation ETFs**: If equities are typically in the 35-65% range, and units are held for more than 36 months, LTCG rules apply. These gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

It is important to factor in taxes when evaluating ETFs, in addition to returns, expenses, volumes, and tracking error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

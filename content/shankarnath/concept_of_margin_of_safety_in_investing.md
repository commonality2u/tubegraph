The concept of a [[risk_management_in_investing | margin of safety]] is a widely discussed topic in investing, highlighted in Chapter 20 of Benjamin Graham's "The Intelligent Investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. It is considered a central principle of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## What is Margin of Safety?
Essentially, the [[risk_management_in_investing | margin of safety]] is a method of reducing the risk of being wrong in an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Graham insisted that all investors should apply some [[risk_management_in_investing | margin of safety]] when investing in stocks or any other security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Practical Analogy
Consider a scenario where you need to travel from point X to point Y for an important meeting, and it typically takes 30 minutes to arrive. To account for potential issues like traffic jams, flat tires, or VIP movements, you add a 15-minute buffer. This buffer serves as your [[risk_management_in_investing | margin of safety]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Application in Stock Investing
In the context of stock market investing, the [[risk_management_in_investing | margin of safety]] is applied by purchasing a stock at a price significantly below its intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

### Benjamin Graham's Intrinsic Value Formula
Benjamin Graham provided a formula to calculate a stock's intrinsic value, using a combination of its earnings per share, growth rate, and the yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This formula was introduced in an updated 1974 edition of "The Intelligent Investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. While the formula itself might be considered outdated today, the underlying principle of a [[risk_management_in_investing | margin of safety]] remains crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

The speaker, for instance, personally insists on having at least a 30% [[risk_management_in_investing | margin of safety]] before investing in any company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Risk and Reward in Value Investing
Graham's teachings, particularly concerning the [[risk_management_in_investing | margin of safety]], highlight that [[risk_management_in_investing | risk]] and reward are not always positively correlated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. In a value portfolio, the greater the potential for reward, the lesser the [[risk_management_in_investing | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This foundational principle of value investing emphasizes that buying assets at a discount to their true worth reduces downside [[risk_management_in_investing | risk]] while increasing potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Endorsement from Warren Buffett
Warren Buffett, a renowned investor and student of Benjamin Graham, stated that Chapter 8 (Mr. Market) and Chapter 20 (Margin of Safety) have been the "Bedrock of my investing activities for more than 60 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. He recommends all investors read and re-read these chapters, especially during periods of strong or weak market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

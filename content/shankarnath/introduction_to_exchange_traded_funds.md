Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are financial instruments that have gained significant prominence globally and in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. As of 2023, ETFs globally manage nearly $11.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

While ETFs were first launched in India in 2002, they remained largely non-existent for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Their resurgence began with the Government of India's initiatives:
*   Recognizing ETFs as an asset class in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Including them in the government's disinvestment initiative in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   The Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) decided to invest 5% (now 15%) of its incremental monthly inflows into ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

These steps led to remarkable growth, transforming ETFs from an asset class of just 12,000 crores in 2015 to over 50 times that size today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It is anticipated that ETFs could become an even larger asset class than mutual funds over the next 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## What is an ETF?

An ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is a tradable security that tracks a specific index, bond, commodity, a group of stocks, or any basket of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

There are two fundamental characteristics of an ETF:
1.  **Tracking**: ETFs derive their value by closely following and replicating the performance of an underlying asset or index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, a Nifty50 index ETF mirrors the performance of the Nifty50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Similarly, a [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | Gold ETF]]'s trading value is dependent on the price of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
2.  **Tradability**: ETFs can be bought and sold on a stock exchange during trading hours, much like individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Trackability and tradability form the basic foundations of any Exchange Traded Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_etfs | Benefits of Investing in ETFs]]

ETFs have become an $11.5 trillion asset class globally, attracting significant net inflows, largely due to their advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

1.  **Simplicity, Diversification, and Transparency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>:
    *   ETFs are typically designed as diversified portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Instead of buying individual stocks, an investor can purchase an ETF (e.g., an FMCG ETF) to own a piece of many popular stocks in that sector at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   Most ETFs are highly transparent, disclosing their holdings daily, and their prices are available in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

2.  **Tradability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>:
    *   ETFs can be easily bought and sold on the stock exchange with a real-time Net Asset Value (NAV) during market hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for investors who want to react to market movements promptly, unlike [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] where transactions are processed based on the next day's NAV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

3.  **Choice and Diversity of Investment Strategies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>: [[different_types_of_etfs_and_investment_strategies | Different Types of ETFs and Investment Strategies]]
    *   Indian investors have access to almost 200 ETFs, most of which are passively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Passive management offers a clear investment objective and helps keep costs low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   The diversity in the ETF universe is extensive, catering to various market segments:
        *   **Broader Market ETFs**: Nifty50, Next50, Nifty Midcap 150, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
        *   **Thematic ETFs**: Banking, Auto, Pharma, IT, Consumption, among others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
        *   **Commodity ETFs**: [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | Gold]] and [[factors_influencing_the_value_and_performance_of_gold_etfs | Silver ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
        *   **Factor-Based/Smart Beta ETFs**: Momentum, Alpha, Low Volatility, Quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
        *   **International ETFs**: NASDAQ, Fang Plus index, Hang Seng, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
        *   **Debt-Based ETFs**: Government securities, Bharat bonds, overnight funds, state development loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   Investors can construct an entire portfolio using various ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

4.  **Low Expense Structure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>: [[Understanding ETF Costs and Taxation | Understanding ETF Costs and Taxation]]
    *   ETFs often have significantly lower expense ratios compared to [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]], with some going below 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   For example, in 2023, Nippon India reduced the charge on its Nifty50 BS ETF to 0.037%, and ICICI Prudential's Nifty50 ETF scheme had an expense ratio as low as 0.0279% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_etfs | Concerns and Drawbacks of Investing in ETFs]]

Despite their advantages, ETFs have several associated costs and potential concerns:

1.  **Incidental Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>: [[Understanding ETF Costs and Taxation | Understanding ETF Costs and Taxation]]
    *   Beyond the expense ratio, investors incur various charges, including broker commissions for buying/selling ETFs, demat charges, STT, SEBI turnover fees, stamp duty, GST, and the bid-ask spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   These costs can add up, making it important to consider the total expenses involved when comparing ETFs to [[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | index funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Heavily traded ETFs (e.g., Nifty50 or gold) generally have lower overall expenses compared to thinly traded ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

2.  **Liquidity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>: [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | Understanding and benefits of liquid ETFs]]
    *   Liquidity refers to how easy it is to buy or sell an ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Issues arise with low-liquidity ETFs where there might not be enough corresponding buy orders when an investor wants to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   Liquidity directly impacts an ETF's NAV; less liquid ETFs can exhibit wild price swings depending on the size of buy or sell orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Investors should especially monitor volumes for thematic, factor-based, or International ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

3.  **Tracking Error** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>:
    *   Tracking error is the standard deviation between the ETF's performance and the performance of the index it tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
    *   Factors contributing to tracking error include delays in security purchase/sale, ETF cash holdings, delays in dividend deployment, and the expense ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. A smaller tracking error indicates superior index replication and is more attractive to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

4.  **Impact Cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>: [[Understanding ETF Costs and Taxation | Understanding ETF Costs and Taxation]]
    *   Impact cost is the potential cost a buyer or seller incurs for a specific order quantity due to prevailing liquidity conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. It measures liquidity risk and reflects how the ETF's market price is influenced by the trade size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   A wider bid-ask spread or larger order size can lead to higher impact costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Less liquid securities typically have higher impact costs, which can reduce total returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This "hidden cost" can range significantly, for example, from 0.03% to 1.3% for Nifty50 ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | ETF vs. Index Funds]]

ETFs and [[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | index funds]] share commonalities: both comprise a portfolio of assets, track an index, have low expenses, and are mostly passively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. However, there are significant differences:

| **Impact of Inflows/Outflows** | When an investor buys or sells, the fund creates new or redeems existing shares, typically without directly impacting other unit holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.                                                                                                                                                                     | When an investor buys or sells, it directly affects all other unit holders as the fund must purchase/redeem underlying securities to match demand, impacting all investors proportionately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Personal Investment Strategies with ETFs

ETFs can be utilized strategically in various investment scenarios:

*   **Tactical Opportunities**: Useful for capitalizing on sharp market dips. For instance, during a sudden market fall (like the 2016 US election results), ETFs allow for immediate buying to take advantage of temporary dips, which might not be possible with [[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | index funds]] due to delayed transaction processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Expense Ratio Discrepancies**: Preferred when the expense ratio difference between an ETF and its corresponding [[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | index fund]] or fund of funds is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. For example, opting for an ETF that is significantly cheaper than an [[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | index fund]] tracking the same index, even considering incidental costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Access to Specific Markets/Factors**: ETFs provide access to international indices (e.g., NASDAQ, Fang Plus index) that might not be available via [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] due to regulatory limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. They also offer exposure to specific factors or themes that might only be available in an ETF format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

It is important to remain flexible with investment instruments, as a diversified portfolio can include a mix of actively managed funds, [[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | index funds]], ETFs, and stocks, each playing a role in achieving investment goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## How to Invest in ETFs

ETFs operate in both a primary and secondary market:
*   **Primary Market**: This is where ETF units are first allocated, similar to a [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual fund]] New Fund Offer (NFO). Investors apply for units during the NFO period, pay the money, and units are allotted when the window opens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Secondary Market**: Once initial allotment is done, the ETF is listed on the stock exchange. All further purchases and sales happen here, similar to stock trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

To buy and sell ETFs, an investor needs:
*   **A Trading Account**: Obtainable through a broker (e.g., Zerodha, ICICI Direct, MStock, Groww, Upstox) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **A Demat Account**: Required to hold the ETF units, with depositories like NSDL or CDSL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## Important Considerations

### Dividend Reinvestment

For most ETFs, any dividends received on the underlying shares are reinvested back into the scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This reinvestment should happen as quickly as possible to minimize [[factors_influencing_the_value_and_performance_of_gold_etfs | tracking error]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Only in exceptional cases are dividends credited directly to the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

### Taxation

[[Understanding ETF Costs and Taxation | ETF returns]] are subject to two types of taxation:

1.  **Dividend Income**: If an ETF distributes dividends, this amount is added to the investor's annual income and taxed according to their income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
2.  **Capital Gains**: Taxation depends on the asset class and holding period.
    *   **Equity ETFs**: Taxation is similar to equity shares and equity-oriented [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]]:
        *   **Short-Term Capital Gain (STCG)**: If units are held for less than 12 months, gains are taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
        *   **Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG)**: If held beyond a year and earnings exceed ₹1 lakh, gains are subject to a 10% tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
    *   **Non-Equity ETFs (e.g., Gold, Debt, International ETFs)**: Following the April 2023 amendment in the finance bill, these are now taxed at the existing income tax slab rate, regardless of the holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
    *   **Asset Allocation ETFs**: If equities constitute 35-65% of the portfolio, and units are held for more than 36 months, LTCG rules apply. Gains are taxed at 20% with indexation [[Understanding ETF Costs and Taxation | benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

Factoring in taxation, along with other variables like returns, expenses, volumes, and tracking error, is crucial when evaluating ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

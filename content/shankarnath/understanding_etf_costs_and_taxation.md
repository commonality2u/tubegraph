Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have become a significant financial instrument globally, with nearly $11.5 trillion under management as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. In India, after remaining relatively non-existent for over a decade since their 2002 launch, ETFs received a fresh lease of life from the government of India. This included recognizing them as an asset class in 2013, making them part of the government's disinvestment initiative in 2014, and the Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) decision to invest an increasing percentage of its incremental monthly inflows into ETFs (initially 5%, now 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This governmental support transformed ETFs from a ₹12,000 crore asset class in 2015 to over 50 times that size, with expectations of them becoming an even larger asset class than [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] in the next 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_etfs | Understanding ETF Costs]]

While ETFs are known for their efficiency and [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | transparency]], it's crucial for investors to understand all associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Low Expense Ratios

One of the primary [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | benefits of ETFs]] is their typically low expense structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Unlike [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] which can have scheme expense ratios of 1% to 2%, some ETFs can go below the 0.1% mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. In 2023, several Asset Management Companies (AMCs) reduced their Total Expense Ratios (TERs) for ETFs; for instance, Nippon India reduced its Nifty50 BS ETF charge to 0.037%, and ICICI Prudential brought its Nifty50 ETF scheme expense ratio down to 0.0279% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Incidental Costs

Despite the low expense ratio, investors incur several incidental costs when buying or selling ETFs:
*   **Broker Commission:** Charges from your broker for buying or selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Demat Charges:** Fees associated with holding units in a dematerialized account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Securities Transaction Tax (STT)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **SEBI Turnover Fees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Stamp Duty** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **GST** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Bid-Ask Spread:** The difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Market Impact:** The cost incurred due to the size of an investor's trade, especially for less liquid ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

It is important to consider all these costs to determine if an ETF is truly cheaper than an index fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Generally, heavily traded ETFs, such as those tracking the Nifty50 or [[factors_influencing_the_value_and_performance_of_gold_etfs | gold]], tend to have much lower expense ratios and impact costs compared to thinly traded ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Impact Cost

Impact cost refers to the potential cost a buyer or seller incurs for a specific order quantity due to prevailing liquidity conditions around that security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. It measures [[investment_considerations_for_liquid_etfs_including_risks_tracking_error_and_taxation | liquidity risk]] and reflects how much an ETF's market price is influenced by the size of an investor's trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

For instance, if a buyer wants 500 units of an ETF, it's matched against the best available sell order (e.g., ₹99) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. If a seller wants to redeem 500 units, the best buy order might be ₹98, leading to a bid-ask spread of ₹1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. However, for a larger order, say 1,500 units, the actual price might deviate significantly from the ideal price (e.g., ₹99.3 instead of ₹98.5), resulting in a higher impact cost (e.g., 0.84% for 1,500 shares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

The less [[understanding_and_benefits_of_liquid_etfs | liquid]] a security is (i.e., fewer buyers and sellers), the longer it takes to execute a trade, leading to a higher impact cost and consequently lower total returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Investors can find the impact cost on the NSE India website under each ETF's details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Industry insiders often call impact cost the "hidden cost" of an ETF, with figures ranging from 0.03% to 1.3% for Nifty50 ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## ETF Taxation

[[tax_implications_of_bond_investments | Taxation]] is another critical factor for ETF investors. ETF returns generally fall into two categories:

### Dividend Income
Any dividend income received on the shares held by the ETF is typically reinvested back into the scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Only in exceptional cases are dividends credited directly to the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. If received by the investor, this amount is added to the investor's annual income and taxed according to their income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### Capital Gain
Income from capital gains depends on two variables: the type of asset class and the holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

#### Equity ETFs
*   **Short-Term Capital Gain (STCG):** If units are held for less than 12 months, a 15% tax applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG):** If held beyond a year, and for earnings exceeding ₹1 lakh, gains are subject to a 10% tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

#### Non-Equity ETFs
For non-equity ETFs such as [[factors_influencing_the_value_and_performance_of_gold_etfs | gold]], debt, and [[different_types_of_etfs_and_investment_strategies | international ETFs]], post the April 2023 amendment in the finance bill, assessing tax liability based on the holding period is irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. These are now taxed according to the investor's existing income tax slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

#### Asset Allocation ETFs
For asset allocation ETFs where equities typically range from 35% to 65%, if units are held for more than 36 months, LTCG rules apply, taxing these gains at 20% with indexation [[tax_implications_of_bond_investments | benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

It is important to factor in taxes when evaluating ETFs, in addition to returns, expenses, volumes, and tracking error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

The concept of the [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] was developed by Mohnish Pabrai, an investor who manages over $700 million in Assets Under Management (AUM) through Pabrai Investment Funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Pabrai gained significant public attention after paying $650,000 for a lunch with Warren Buffett in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. He also founded the Dakshana Foundation in 2005, which tutors and assists economically disadvantaged children in attending elite higher learning institutions like the IITs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Genesis of the Free Lunch Portfolio

The idea for the [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] originated from an article Mohnish Pabrai co-wrote for Forbes in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. In this article, he outlined a strategy of "shameless cloning" â€“ copying the investment moves of other successful investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This strategy leverages the fact that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandates quarterly disclosure of holdings for individuals and entities with at least $100 million invested in U.S. equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

A simple cloning strategy outlined by Pabrai yielded an annualized return of 15.5% over a 17-year period, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 4.8% return during the same period, resulting in an alpha of 10.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This impressive performance prompted Pabrai to establish his own [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Structure of the Free Lunch Portfolio

The [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] is composed of 15 stocks, divided into five stocks across three distinct categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>:
1.  **Spawners** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
2.  **Shameless Cloners** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
3.  **Uber Cannibals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

While this specific portfolio is not identical to Mohnish Pabrai's actual holdings, it reflects his investment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The list of constituents is dynamic, with Pabrai announcing changes annually and allowing flexibility for replacements throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For investment, Pabrai recommends equal weighting the stocks in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## 2023 Free Lunch Portfolio Stock Categories

### Spawners

Spawners are companies with "incubation in their DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. They possess the ability to allocate capital, infrastructure, and human resources to launch new businesses that have the potential to grow into multi-billion dollar entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. These companies typically use a "cash cow" business to fund new ventures, even if unrelated to the core business, to fuel future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Examples include Alphabet (Google), which started as a search engine but now encompasses ventures like YouTube, Nest, Fitbit, and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The five spawner stocks recommended by Mohnish Pabrai for the current year are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>:
*   **DAV Airports**: Operates 15 airports across eight countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Restaurant Brands**: Owns 28,000 restaurants in over 100 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Starbucks**: Known for its coffee sales and customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**: Actively expanding its spawning capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Brookfield Corporation**: Recently spun off an asset management division and holds significant real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, and private equity assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Berkshire Hathaway was part of this list until last year but was pushed out for the current selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Shameless Cloners

Mohnish Pabrai openly refers to himself as a "Shameless Cloner," having invested in stocks purchased by Berkshire Hathaway and even emulated the Buffett partnership structure for his own investment funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This category involves identifying value-oriented investors who are experts in specific sectors and then copying their high-conviction bets by examining their 13F filings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Key investors often cloned include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>:
*   Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger (Berkshire Hathaway) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
*   Bill Ackman (Pershing Square) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
*   Eddie Lampert (ESL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
*   Guy Spier (Marine Fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
*   David Tepper (Appaloosa Management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   Li Lu (Himalaya Capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>

The 2023 Shameless Cloners list features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>:
*   **Resource Logistics**: A Turkish company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Alphabet**: Picked by the Children's Investment Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Chipotle**: A high-conviction bet by Pershing Square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Alibaba Holdings**: A holding of Appaloosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Tencent**: Value Partners is bullish on this stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Notably, three of these five companies are not domiciled in the United States (one Turkish, two Chinese), providing international diversification due to their potentially low valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Uber Cannibals

Uber Cannibals are companies that actively buy back their own shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Companies that engage in buybacks typically have substantial cash reserves, anticipate minimal competition or disruption in their business model, and believe their stock is currently undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Share buybacks can increase an investor's ownership stake and boost earnings per share without requiring additional capital investment from the shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

The five Uber Cannibal companies identified by Pabrai for their consistent share repurchases are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>:
*   **Assured Guaranty**: An insurance and asset management firm, which has reduced its outstanding shares from 183 million in 2011 to 86 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Primerica**: Outstanding shares decreased from 72 million to 40 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Navient**: A business process solutions company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Discover Financial Services**: Bought back over 40% of its shares in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Jack in the Box**: Shares reduced from 31 million in 2017 to 21 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

These companies are characterized by solid free cash flows, which are deployed to repurchase their own shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Recently, Pabrai replaced Navient and Discover Financial Services with eBay and Toll Brothers in his Uber Cannibals list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Portfolio Performance

The performance of the [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] has not always met initial high expectations, particularly in its first three years (2018, 2019, 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. However, after methodological changes in 2021, the portfolio's performance has more closely aligned with the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The portfolio is built on value investing principles such as spin-offs, cash flows, and moats, which often require time to materialize and show results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Creating an Indian Version of the Free Lunch Portfolio

The framework of the [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] can be adapted to the Indian market.

### Indian Spawners

Other examples include the Adani Group (ports, power, airports, renewable energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, State Bank of India (incubating digital platforms like Yono) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, Info Edge India (acting as a digital Berkshire Hathaway) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, IndiaMart (acquiring numerous businesses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, and IEX (Indian Energy Exchange Limited) which spawned IGX (Indian Gas Exchange) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Indian Shameless Cloners

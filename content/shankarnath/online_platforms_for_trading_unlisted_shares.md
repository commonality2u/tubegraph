## How to Buy Unlisted Shares via Online Platforms

The [[steps_to_buy_unlisted_shares | process of buying unlisted shares]] on an online platform like Precise involves several straightforward steps:

1.  **Registration**: Register online, which typically doesn't require attaching physical documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
2.  **Discover Companies**: Navigate to the "discover private equity" section to view available [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted companies]] whose shares are available for over-the-counter purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Platforms may also list "coming soon" companies, allowing users to set alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Review Details**: Select a company to view details such as share price, lot size, and applicable fees, including an upfront transaction fee (e.g., 2%), stamp duty, GST, and documentation charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
4.  **Due Diligence**: Access research documents provided by the platform, which may include information on the sector, company, market data, products, management, financials (balance sheet, P&L, cash flow), ratios, competitors, and shareholder information, sometimes including annual reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
5.  **Verify Profile**: Input additional information like bank account details, Demat number, and PAN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
6.  **Add Funds**: Deposit funds into the account using methods like UPI, bank transfer (NEFT, RTGS, IMPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
7.  **Place Order**: Confirm the purchase. The buying journey moves into a "processing stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
8.  **Share Transfer**: Shares bought via the platform are typically deposited into the investor's depository account within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The investor receives confirmation once shares are credited to their Demat account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Online platforms also provide resources to help investors understand the [[process_of_buying_unlisted_shares | buying journey]] and the maintenance of [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Once the IPO occurs and unlisted shares become listed, they can be traded on a stock exchange, though a typical holding period of 6 months may apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Taxation on Unlisted Shares

Regarding [[taxation_on_unlisted_shares | taxation on unlisted shares]], the holding period to differentiate between short-term and long-term capital gains remains 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Capital Gain (STCG)**: If an [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted share]] is sold within 24 months of purchase, STCG tax is applicable, computed per the investor's slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG)**: If sold after 24 months, LTCG tax applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Recent changes have set the LTCG tax at 12.5%, compared to an earlier 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This change is seen as a significant benefit for the [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares industry]] and is expected to further grow this market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. It is advisable to consult a tax advisor or chartered accountant for specific tax guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Risks and Mitigation

While online platforms enhance transparency, the gray market where pre-IPO shares are traded is not regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India), implying a higher inherent [[investment_risks_in_unlisted_shares | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
[[risks_and_challenges_of_investing_in_unlisted_shares | Risks and challenges of investing in unlisted shares]] include:
*   **Capital Loss**: If an [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted company]] fails or goes bankrupt, the entire capital can be at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Issues**: It can sometimes be difficult to buy or sell [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, though platforms like Precise assist with liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **IPO Delay**: Delays in a company's IPO can lead to a drop in the unlisted share's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Dilution**: Share value and ownership can reduce as more investors are issued shares through ESOPs, rights issues, or preferential allotments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Fraud**: There is a risk of scams and manipulations, such as fake shares, inflated stock prices, or misrepresentation of financials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Online platforms attempt to mitigate some of these [[risks_and_challenges_of_investing_in_unlisted_shares | risks]] by offering good research, keeping ticket sizes low, and providing a well-laid-out workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The market for [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | pre-IPO unlisted shares]] is expected to grow as more private companies move towards public listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

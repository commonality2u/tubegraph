[[benefits_of_asset_allocation_in_diversifying_investments | Diversification]] and [[rebalancing_and_switching_strategies_in_mutual_funds | rebalancing]] are two critical pillars when constructing an "all-weather portfolio," which aims to be prepared for any economic condition or calamity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> The goal of such a portfolio is not to outperform but to sustain economic surprises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

## Diversification

[[importance_of_diversified_portfolio | Diversification]] involves getting the asset mix right within a portfolio. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> Different asset classes perform differently at any given time, and it is highly unlikely that all will be negative simultaneously, even in the worst of times. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a> The aim is to build a portfolio where the sum of its parts is greater than the individual components, meaning if one or two asset classes falter, others can perform well. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>

### Key Principles of Diversification

*   **Negative or Low Correlation:** It is crucial to diversify with assets that are negatively or at least have a low correlation to one another. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> For instance, equities and gold have historically shown tangential performance over different time periods, making gold a solid hedge for equities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> This is why Ray Dalio recommends an allocation of 7.5% to 15% in hedge assets like gold and commodities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   **Avoiding Highly Correlated Assets:** Investors should avoid diversifying with assets that might appear different but in reality tend to move together. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> For example, the Nifty50 and the Nifty Midcap 150 indices are tightly correlated over long periods, which does not effectively serve diversification goals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> In contrast, gold demonstrates significant divergence from equity indices, making it an excellent diversifier. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>

## Rebalancing

[[rebalancing_and_switching_strategies_in_mutual_funds | Rebalancing]] is the second essential pillar of an all-weather strategy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> It involves periodically adjusting a portfolio to maintain its original asset allocation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> Ray Dalio highly recommends annual rebalancing and employs it for his own all-weather portfolio. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

### Impact of Rebalancing

The practice of rebalancing can impact portfolio returns. For example, an Indian all-weather portfolio with annual rebalancing yielded an annualized return of 9.5%, while without rebalancing, the yearly returns were slightly lower at 9.3%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a> Although the performance difference with or without rebalancing can vary across different time periods, maintaining the original asset allocation through rebalancing is fundamental to the concept of the all-weather portfolio. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>

## Conclusion

A robust all-weather strategy is built upon [[benefits_of_asset_allocation_in_diversifying_investments | multiple diversified assets]] like equity, gold, and debt, along with a layer of annual [[portfolio_management_and_rebalancing_for_trending_value_strategy | rebalancing]] and [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | systematic investing]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> This approach helps in navigating tough economic conditions and can historically offer stable returns at low volatility. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>

An investor's primary reason for buying stock is to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. When a promoter increases their stake in a company, it suggests they believe the company is more valuable than its current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This action can serve as a promising signal for other investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This article explores the significance of promoter stake changes as an investment strategy, drawing heavily from a talk by Mr. Maran Goind Swami of UniFi Capital titled "Indian promoters are the best contrarians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## [[comparing_promoterdriven_ownership_in_india_versus_western_markets | Promoter Ownership: India vs. Western Markets]]

In Western markets (like the US, Europe, Canada, Australia), there is a clear separation between ownership and management, with institutions typically owning a large portion of shares and professional managers running the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

In India (Bhat), the owner and manager are often the same person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Among the top 500 companies (representing 94-95% of total market cap), 70-75% have a CEO or Managing Director who is either the promoter or appointed by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Promoters hold the largest share of ownership by market capitalization, fluctuating between 45% and 55% over the past 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   While some companies like TCS, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Adani Enterprises, and DLF have high promoter holdings (65-75%), the average across companies is around 50%, which is a significant number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   Monitoring increases or decreases in promoter holdings can provide more valuable information than focusing solely on institutional holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## [[methods_promoters_use_to_increase_their_stake_in_a_company | Methods Promoters Use to Increase Their Stake]]

Promoters typically increase their stake through five methods:
1.  **Open Market Purchases**: Promoters buy shares directly from the open market, subject to regulatory norms and laws like the Takeover Act and insider trading regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
2.  **Preferential Issue**: Shares are issued to a select group of investors, including promoters, which can also be a quick way to raise capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
3.  **Warrants**: These give promoters the right to buy a specified number of shares at a predetermined price within a set timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Promoters typically exercise warrants if the current share price exceeds the exercise price, increasing their stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
4.  **Rights Issue**: This involves offering existing shareholders, including promoters, the right to purchase new shares pro-rata to their existing holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
5.  **Buybacks**: Unlike other methods, promoters can increase their shareholding by *not* participating in a company buyback, as the total number of outstanding shares decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Retail investors can potentially profit from buyback opportunities, as seen with TCS and Suhani Ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Promoters as Contrarian Investors

Promoters are often shrewd businessmen who understand valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. They tend to buy when the odds are in their favor and may dilute their stake when valuations are unfavorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Buying Behavior**: During periods when the midcap index was cheap, such as throughout 2009 and from April to December 2020 (the COVID months), promoters significantly increased their stakes. Over 100 companies saw promoters increase their stake by at least half a percent within a quarter during these times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Promoters generally avoid buying when conditions suggest high valuations, such as record mutual fund collections, high FII inflows, strong stock market returns, increased retail investor participation, and numerous IPOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Selling Behavior**: Conversely, when the midcap index experienced a massive run-up in 2016-2017, promoters refrained from additional stock purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Some promoters even strategically dilute their stake during periods of high valuations. For instance, in April-June of the previous year, when mid and small caps reached all-time highs, promoters of over 100 companies reportedly sold shares worth more than â‚¹16,000 crores in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This includes promoters of HDFC AMC, Vedant Fashions, Coforge, TD Power, and MTAR Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Sectoral Trends**: This contrarian phenomenon is also evident on a sectoral basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. While the FMCG sector performed exceptionally well in 2018-2019 with stocks trading at high P/E multiples (50-70), there was virtually no promoter buying activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. In contrast, sectors like Auto, Pharma, and Metals, which performed poorly during the same period, saw significant insider buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_based_on_tracking_promoter_activities | Investment Strategy: Shadowing Promoters]]

Given their contrarian nature and insider knowledge, tracking promoter activity can be a valuable [[investment_strategies_based_on_tracking_promoter_activities | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Existing Strategies**: UniFi Capital, led by Mr. Maran, has an "Insider Shadow" strategy, and previously, a Rubic PMS with an investment objective to build a portfolio of multi-cap companies where promoters are gradually increasing their stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Nepean Capital also actively looks at promoter buying, terming it "smart money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Performance Evidence**:
    *   A random sample of 30-35 companies where promoter stakes increased by at least 3% showed that, as a portfolio, these companies performed exceedingly well, with returns 10-11% higher than the Nifty 500 Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   A 15-year study by Mr. Maran's team, tracking companies with increased promoter shareholding, found that over three-year periods:
        *   Approximately 11% of companies showed no movement or negative returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
        *   14-15% had single-digit returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
        *   A substantial 73% delivered significant investor returns, potentially 20-30% higher than the index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This demonstrates a strong [[performance_analysis_in_indian_stock_market | correlation between promoter buying and company performance]].
*   **Common Characteristics**: Companies where promoters increase their shareholding often possess characteristics indicative of financial strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. A study revealed that over half (56%) of these companies had zero debt or a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This suggests promoters commit capital when a company is in good financial health or is expected to be so in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This also highlights the importance of [[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | evaluating stock performance using financial ratios]].

### Considerations and Recommendations

While shadowing promoters merits attention, it's not an infallible rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   There are cases where stock prices continue to decline even after promoters increase their stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   Some stocks may stagnate for one to three years after an increase in promoter stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   It is advisable to view this as a portfolio strategy rather than relying on individual stock picks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

**Suggested Approach**:
1.  Extract a list of companies where promoter holding has increased (e.g., by 1%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
2.  Conduct necessary checks on financial metrics like the P/E ratio, ROC (Return on Capital Employed), sales growth, and free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. These are key [[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | financial ratios]] and [[business_operations_metrics_in_stock_analysis | business operations metrics]] for stock analysis.
3.  Shrink the list to a manageable number (e.g., 30 companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
4.  Examine each company individually to determine those with the highest chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
5.  Finalize a list of 10-12 companies comfortable for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

By shadowing promoters, who have proven to be smart contrarian investors, one can potentially achieve excess profits over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This strategy adds another valuable evaluation point to an investor's toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

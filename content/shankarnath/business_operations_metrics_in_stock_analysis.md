Dr. Vijay Malik's "final checklist for buying stocks" includes business parameters as a key category for evaluating potential investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This category, which is one of four major areas (alongside [[Financial metrics for evaluating stocks | financial metrics]], [[Valuation metrics in stock selection | valuation related numbers]], and [[Management analysis for stock investment | management of the company]]), focuses on the operational health and competitive standing of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

There are five key metrics related to a company's business and operations:

## 1. Comparison with Industry Peers
A desirable company should exhibit sales growth that is higher than its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This superior performance suggests the company possesses an "economic moat" that it is effectively utilizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. For example, Pi Industries, operating in the agrochemical sector alongside competitors like UPL, Sumitomo Chemicals, Rallies India, and Sharda Crop Chem, has consistently grown its sales at a faster rate than its peers, which is considered a significant positive in this checklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:08">[05:43:08]</a>.

## 2. Increase in Production Capacity and Sales Volume
It is important to assess if a company is increasing its production capacity and sales volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:11">[06:09:11]</a>. While evaluating the "delta" in production capacity can be challenging, companies performing well in this aspect are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

## 3. Conversion of Sales Growth into Profit Growth
This metric examines the alignment between sales growth and profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:09">[06:23:09]</a>. Ideally, profits should grow in tandem with sales. Scenarios to avoid include:
*   Flat sales accompanied by growing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   Sales growing significantly faster than profits, as observed with Sharda Crop Chem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

## 4. Conversion of Profits into Cash
This factor, also present in the [[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | financial metrics]] section, emphasizes the importance of a company's cash flow from operations being in close proximity to its net profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:03">[06:45:03]</a>. When operational cash flow aligns closely with net profits, it indicates that reported earnings are supported by actual cash inflows from core operating activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Divergence between these figures might suggest an aggressive revenue recognition policy, working capital changes (such as lenient credit terms for customers), or a high percentage of non-cash items like depreciation and amortization that reduce net profits but don't directly impact cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

## 5. Creation of Shareholder Value from Retained Profits
This metric assesses whether the company is effectively utilizing its retained profits to increase shareholder value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. It means that the company's market capitalization increase over the last 10 years should be greater than the increase in its retained earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. For instance, Signity Technology was noted for its market capitalization growing at a slower pace compared to its reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

These business operations metrics, when combined with [[Financial metrics for evaluating stocks | financial metrics]], [[Management analysis for stock investment | management analysis]], and [[Valuation metrics in stock selection | valuation parameters]], form a comprehensive framework for stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. While all categories are important, Dr. Malik suggests that if any category can be relaxed, it is the [[Valuation metrics in stock selection | valuation parameter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. This is because the first three categories help identify a fundamentally strong company, and an expensive valuation only means adjusting return expectations, not necessarily avoiding a quality business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.

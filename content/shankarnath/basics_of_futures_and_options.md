Many investors traditionally identify undervalued stocks, invest in them, wait for prices to rise, and then profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, [[how_futures_contracts_work | Futures]] and [[option_trading_strategies | options]] (F&O) expand possibilities, allowing investors to profit when the market goes up, goes down, or remains relatively flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This article provides a beginner's understanding of these financial instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Understanding Derivatives

The term "[[understanding_derivatives_in_finance | derivative]]" refers to a financial contract whose value is dependent on an underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For example, Nifty Futures is a derivative contract that derives its value from the [[function_and_advantages_of_the_nifty_1day_rate_index | Nifty 50 Index]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The word "derivative" comes from the Latin "derivare," meaning "obtained from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Derivatives can obtain their value from various underlying assets, including:
*   A single stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   An index like the [[function_and_advantages_of_the_nifty_1day_rate_index | Nifty 50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   A basket of commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   Houses, crude oil, fruits, vegetables, coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Gold, such as the Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) released by the Reserve Bank of India, which derives its value from the price of physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The global derivatives market is enormous, with a value of 700 trillion dollars, making it the largest asset class in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Specific to equities, there are five types of derivative contracts: forwards, futures, options, warrants, and swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In India, forwards, warrants, and swaps are less popular, so the focus is often on futures and options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Futures Contracts

A [[how_futures_contracts_work | Futures Contract]] is a legal agreement to purchase or sell a physical asset or security at a predetermined price and a specified time in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### How Futures Work: An Example

Consider Nestle, which sells coffee and wants price predictability for its raw material, coffee beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. A coffee bean producer and Nestle might enter into a futures contract to lock in a price for a future date, such as three months from now, regardless of the market price at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

*   No money is exchanged initially, except for an initial margin that the producer might ask for to reduce non-payment risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   This mechanism is common in agriculture, energy products, metals, currencies, and financial products like indices, bonds, [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]], and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Trading Futures

When trading futures, such as for a stock like ICICI Bank, there are typically three future options presented: the current month's contract, the next month's, and the month after that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

*   **Expiry**: Any month's future contract expires on the last Thursday of that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. When one expires, a new contract for a future month (e.g., June after March) is added, maintaining a three-month sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Price Locking**: If you buy an April Futures Contract for ICICI Bank at 845 rupees, you agree to receive the shares at 845 rupees on the expiry date, regardless of the spot (actual) share price at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss**:
    *   Similar to stock transactions, if the futures price goes above your agreed-upon price (e.g., 845 rupees), you can sell (square off) your position for a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Conversely, selling at a lower price results in a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   At expiration, if the spot price of the underlying asset (e.g., ICICI Bank) goes up to 870 rupees, the futures price will also align, resulting in a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. If the share price drops, you incur a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Quantity and Margin

*   **Lot Size**: Unlike shares that can be bought individually, futures must be bought in specific quantities called "lots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Futures were not designed for retail investors, and standardizing lot sizes helps traders understand pricing, risk, and trade costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. For example, the current lot size for ICICI Bank Futures is 700 shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Margin**: Investors do not pay the full contract value (e.g., 5.9 lakh rupees for an ICICI Bank lot) upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Instead, they pay a partial amount called a "margin," which acts like an advance to ensure parties honor their transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This margin might be around 18% of the contract value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

Futures are available for many stocks (currently around 198) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:09:01]</a>, as well as for the popular [[function_and_advantages_of_the_nifty_1day_rate_index | Nifty Futures]] and Bank Nifty Futures, which are traded in huge volumes daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Options Contracts

[[Option Trading Strategies | Options]] are a type of financial [[understanding_derivatives_in_finance | derivative]] that give the holder the *right*, but not the *obligation*, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price and date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### How Options Work: An Example

Using the Nestle and coffee bean producer example: Nestle might offer a token amount (e.g., five lakh rupees) to the producer to lock in a deal to purchase coffee beans worth one crore rupees within the next two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This five lakh rupees is an options contract, providing Nestle with flexibility based on future coffee prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Types of Options: Call and Put

#### Call Option

A [[comparing_call_and_put_options | call option]] grants its buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy an agreed quantity of a commodity or financial instrument from the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   It has a time window ending on an **expiration date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   The transaction is for a certain price, known as the **strike price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   The buyer pays a small fee to the seller, called a **premium**, for this right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

In the Nestle example, Nestle (the option buyer) paid five lakh rupees (premium) to the producer (option seller) for the right (but not obligation) to buy coffee beans worth one crore (strike price) within two months (expiration date) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

Consider these scenarios for Nestle:
1.  **Price goes up**: If coffee price rises to 1.5 crores, Nestle would exercise its call option, buying at one crore and saving 45 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Price goes down**: If coffee price falls to 70 lakhs, Nestle would *not* exercise the option. It would walk away from the deal and buy coffee at the lower market price, saving 25 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
3.  **Price remains flat**: If the price stays at one crore, Nestle would again *not* exercise the option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

The Coffee Bean producer makes money from the premium if the price stays at the same level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

#### Put Option

A [[comparing_call_and_put_options | put option]] is the reverse of a call option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The put option buyer anticipates a fall in the price of the underlying asset and wants to retain the right to sell it at a higher price until the expiry date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Option Strategies

There are four foundational paths in any [[option_trading_strategies | option strategy]]: buying a call, selling a call, buying a put, and selling a put <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:30]</a>.

*   **Bullish View**: If an investor is bullish on a stock or the [[function_and_advantages_of_the_nifty_1day_rate_index | Nifty]], it is ideal to buy a [[comparing_call_and_put_options | call option]] or sell a [[comparing_call_and_put_options | put option]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Bearish View**: If an investor is bearish, they should sell a [[comparing_call_and_put_options | call option]] or buy a [[comparing_call_and_put_options | put option]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

These are just the basics. Further reading on terms like Amo, Stop Loss, Intraday Cover Order, Market Order, and Limit Order is recommended before executing any trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. There are also many different ways to trade in futures and options and various strategies one can employ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

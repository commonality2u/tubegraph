Over the nine years of the Narendra Modi government, the Indian stock market has experienced significant growth, with record inflows from domestic and foreign investors. The market capitalization has tripled from 1.2 trillion to 3.5 trillion dollars during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. An article in The Economic Times identified 44 stocks that delivered over 1000% returns in these nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The objective of analyzing these "superstar stocks" as a portfolio is to identify reasons for their success and improve personal [[investment_strategies_for_wealth_creation | investing decisions]], potentially identifying future [[investment_strategies_for_multibagger_stocks | multibaggers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This analysis integrates concepts from various [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing strategies]] previously explored, including [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | coffee can investing]], [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | Peter Lynch's]] small-cap framework, the Magic Formula, Ambit Capital's Ten Bagger framework, and the Monopoly portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Key Variables and Metrics for Analysis

To understand the success of these superstar stocks, several variables were studied. While some difficult-to-discover metrics like market share and P/E ratio relative to the industry were excluded, along with useful variables like earnings yield and free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, the following were considered crucial:

### Sales Growth
A bare minimum of 10% sales growth over the last 10 years is sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The superstar stocks averaged nearly 15% 10-year sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, sales journeys are not linear, as seen with Electra Green Tech, which despite a 31.6% 10-year annualized sales growth, had inconsistent year-on-year growth concentrated in the last few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It's also important to differentiate between sales growth due to volume increase versus price hikes, as exemplified by the FMCG industry in Q4 2021, where sales value increased despite a volume degrowth due to price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth
EPS growth is a fundamental metric directly correlated with share price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A study of over 600 companies showed that a 15.1% EPS growth over 10 years correlated with an average share price appreciation of almost 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. For the 44 superstar companies, an EPS growth of less than 10% was not observed in any 10-bagger, with the "sweet spot" for long-term investors being a 20% to 25% EPS growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Return on Capital Employed (RoCE)
RoCE is a popular metric favored by various [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investment strategies]], including [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | Robert Kirby's coffee can investing]] (recommending at least 15% RoCE) and the Massless team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A majority of the 44 superstar stocks exceeded 15% RoCE, with the average at 23.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Top performers showed an ability to increase their RoCE over many years, indicating higher profits relative to capital invested and a strengthening competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### PEG Ratio
Created by [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | Peter Lynch]], the PEG ratio (P/E ratio divided by expected EPS growth rate) incorporates both valuation and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Lynch suggested that stocks with a PEG ratio above one are overvalued, and below one are undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Surprisingly, eight of the superstar stocks had a PEG ratio less than one based on current data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The median PEG ratio for Nifty 500 companies is 1.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, suggesting that superstar companies with a PEG ratio of 1.4 or less warrant deeper investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Capital Employed Turnover Ratio
Learned from Ambit's Ten Bagger framework, this ratio measures how effectively a company uses fixed assets to generate sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. A higher ratio is generally better, but it's industry-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. While about half of the superstar companies had a ratio above their industry average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, companies that delivered 4000%+ returns consistently had a capital employed turnover ratio significantly higher than their industry benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)
Increasing CFO is crucial for covering operational expenses, reducing reliance on external financing, enabling investments (R&D, expansion, acquisitions), and providing shareholder returns via dividends or buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Most superstar companies showed consistent CFO growth, such as SRF, Balaji Amines, Astral, and Tata Elxsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Inconsistent or declining CFOs were observed in others, like KPR Mills and Sonata Software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Forensic Analysis
This involves accounting checks to assess a company's financial cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Cash Flow from Operations as a Percentage of EBITDA**: This metric shows if reported earnings translate into actual cash receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. A high value is preferred, and deviations require scrutiny, as they could indicate financial mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The average for superstar stocks (excluding financial companies) was 67%, but relative comparison over time and with industry peers is more insightful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Contingent Liabilities as a Percentage of Net Worth**: This indicates potential future obligations. A value exceeding 20% is a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. While most superstar stocks had this metric in low single digits, a few had it at 20% or higher, representing significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, such as Sonata Software Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

### Fragility Scorecard
This scorecard assesses a company's robustness using four metrics:
1.  **Equity as a percentage of total liabilities**: Desired to be high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
2.  **Break-even sales as a percentage of actual sales**: Ideally low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
3.  **Return on Capital Employed (RoCE)**: Higher is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
4.  **Cash flows from operations as a multiple of annual debt obligations plus replacement capex**: Should be a high multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

Most superstar companies were robust, with a median equity as a percentage of total liabilities of 63%, break-even sales of 22%, median RoCE of almost 23%, and a CFO multiplier of 1.6 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. However, exceptions like Trent showed significant issues across all four parameters, despite a beautiful share price arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Key Characteristics of Superstar Stocks (Reverse Screen Criteria)
Based on the analysis, a "superstar stock" ideally exhibits the following characteristics:
*   Sales growth of over 15% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   EPS growth of over 24% year-on-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) of 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   PEG ratio lower than 1.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   Capital employed turnover ratio higher than its industry average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   Increasing cash flow from operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   High operational cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
*   Low contingent liability as a percentage of net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   Exhibits robustness according to the fragility scorecard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

## Identifying Future Multibaggers
No single company among the 44 superstar stocks complied with every variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. However, a viable subset that largely aligns with these criteria includes:
*   Balaji Amines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>
*   APL Apollo Tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>
*   SRF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>
*   Astral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>
*   Tata Elxsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>
*   Deepak Nitrite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>
*   KPR Mills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>
*   Tanla Platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>
*   Alkyl Amines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>
*   KEI Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>

This analysis, primarily based on historical data, serves as a useful reverse screen exercise to improve [[investment_strategies_for_wealth_creation | investing decisions]] and increase the odds of picking potential [[investment_strategies_for_multibagger_stocks | multibaggers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

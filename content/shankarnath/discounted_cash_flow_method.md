The [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] of a share represents its true worth, and calculating it is a core quest for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method is one of three primary approaches used to determine a company's [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This method aims to assess how much a business might be worth based on its future cash generation potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Understanding the Concept

Imagine every business as a "money printing machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. When considering buying such a machine, like Infosys for 5.84 lakh crores, the key is to determine if the price is justified by the money it will print in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A proper assessment of [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] helps prevent overpaying for a stock and identifies undervalued opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

However, there is no 100% accurate answer to [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. An investor computing it is making an estimation of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Therefore, before beginning the quantitative process, it's crucial to understand the company's current condition and growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The quantitative calculation of [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] should only be done if the company passes a qualitative checklist first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. As Warren Buffett stated, it's "far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than to buy a fair company at a wonderful price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Warren Buffett defines [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] as the present value of all the cash a business will generate from now until "judgment day," discounted at the proper rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Essentially, for a "money printing machine," an investor wants two pieces of information:
1.  How much cash the business will generate in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
2.  What those future cash flows are worth in today's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Steps for Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (Infosys Example)

There are five main steps to conduct a DCF exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Step 1: Understand Owner's Earnings

Owner's earnings represent the amount of money a business makes for its owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
The formula for owner's earnings is:
`Operating Cash Flow - Maintenance Capital Expenditure` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>

*   **Operating Cash Flow (OCF)**: This is the cash generated by a company's core business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. For Infosys in FY23, OCF was over 31,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Maintenance Capital Expenditure (Maintenance Capex)**: This is the money a company *must* spend to continue operations and sustain growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. For Infosys, this includes property expenses and buying laptops for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. While challenging to pinpoint in financial statements, it can be estimated from the expenditure row in the cash flow statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Using the Infosys example:
31,261 crores (OCF) - 2,579 crores (Maintenance Capex) = 28,682 crores (Owner's Earnings for FY23) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Some investors tweak this formula based on their understanding of financial statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. If maintenance capex cannot be found, total capex (which includes both maintenance and growth spending) can be used. This leads to the definition of [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | free cash flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Infosys, for instance, reported a [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | free cash flow]] of 20,443 crores, which was a significant variation from the calculated owner's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Step 2: Project Future Cash Flows

This step involves imagining the business's future over a reasonable period, such as the next 10 years for a large company like Infosys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

#### Part 1: Buildup of Owner's Earnings
Forecast the growth of owner's earnings over the projection period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. For Infosys, a 7% growth tapering down to 5% could be assumed, leading to earnings growing from 28,000 crores to 50,000 crores by 2033 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

#### Part 2: Calculating Terminal Value
At the end of the projection period (e.g., 10th year), an investor assumes the entire business will be sold, receiving a "terminal value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This concept is similar to the [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | relative value model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
For IT services businesses, one could assume a valuation based on owner's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Historically, Infosys's market cap to owner's earnings ratio has averaged 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. A conservative estimate might use a multiple of 16 for the terminal value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

Terminal Value Calculation for Infosys (10th year):
16 (multiple) * 50,867 crores (projected owner's earnings) = 8,13,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

DCF modeling is complex and tricky due to these many assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. For example, slight changes in growth rates or terminal value multiples can significantly alter the total projected cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. It's crucial for investors to be objective and not let emotions influence projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Step 3: Discount Future Cash Flows to Present Value

This step involves bringing the future cash flows back to their worth in today's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This is analogous to a fixed deposit: if you put 1,000 rupees in an 8% FD, you get 1,080 rupees back in a year. Conversely, if promised 1,080 rupees in a year, you'd only pay 1,000 rupees today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The formula for discounting future cash flows is:
`Future Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^Number of Years Away` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>

For Infosys:
*   FY24 (1 year away) projected cash flow of 30,690 crores at an 8% discount rate: 30,690 / (1 + 0.08)^1 = Present Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   FY25 (2 years away) projected cash flow of 32,838 crores at an 8% discount rate: 32,838 / (1 + 0.08)^2 = Present Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

Summing the present values of all future cash flows (including the terminal value) provides the total present value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Using an 8% discount rate, Infosys's sum total of present values is 6.4 lakh crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

#### The Discount Rate
The discount rate is a critical number in DCF because a higher discount rate leads to a lower present value of future cash flows and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. For instance, increasing the discount rate to 14% for Infosys would drop the sum total of present values to 4.2 lakh crores, a 35% reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

There are several ways to arrive at a discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>:
*   **Cost of Capital Approach**: Reflects the average return rate a company pays to its debtors and equity shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Hurdle Rate Approach**: Sets the discount rate based on the minimum target rate of return a business must achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Market Data Approach**: Looks at discount rates of comparable projects or companies in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Intuition**: Many practitioners rely on their experience and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The speaker generally uses a 12% discount rate for their own calculations, seeing it as the minimum percentage return acceptable for investing in a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Applying a 12% discount rate to Infosys's estimated future cash flows results in a present value sum total of 4.8 lakh crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Step 4: Add Cash and Liquid Investments

To the present value of the discounted cash flows, add the company's cash and liquid investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
For Infosys, this includes 12,000 crores in cash equivalents and over 19,000 crores in liquid investments (mutual funds, government securities, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
Adding these to the 4.8 lakh crores (present value of cash flows) gives a total [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] of 5,12,145 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Step 5: Calculate Intrinsic Value Per Share

Divide the total [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] by the number of shares outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
For Infosys, with approximately 420 crore shares:
5,12,145 crores / 420 crores shares = 1,221 rupees per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

### Step 6: Apply Margin of Safety

Since DCF relies on a "bunch of assumptions" and estimations, a "margin of safety" is crucial to add a layer of protection to the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
The margin of safety is an additional discount applied to the calculated [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

For Infosys, applying a 30% margin of safety to the 1,221 rupees intrinsic value:
1,221 rupees * (1 - 0.30) = 854 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
This means an informed investor would ideally buy Infosys shares only when they come down to 854 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This 30% margin of safety is also an assumption and can be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Conclusion and Comparison

Based on the calculations:
*   **Total Intrinsic Value (Infosys)**: ~5.12 lakh crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>
*   **Intrinsic Value per Share (Infosys)**: 1,221 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>
*   **Current Market Price (Infosys, at time of recording)**: 1,424 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>

According to these DCF calculations, Infosys is currently overvalued by about 16% (1424 vs 1221) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
The defined buy price with a 30% margin of safety is 854 rupees a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Despite requiring estimations and assumptions, the DCF method provides a great starting point for understanding a business's probable value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

Silver, often termed "poor man's gold," has recently seen a surge in interest as an investment, challenging the traditional preference for [[benefits_of_investing_in_gold | gold]]. This shift became notably apparent during Dhanteras, a Hindu festival where purchasing precious metals is customary to usher in good fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Recent Trends During Dhanteras
During a recent Dhanteras, the demand for silver surpassed that of gold for the first time ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Sales of [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]] were approximately 15% lower than the previous year, while silver demand soared by 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This occurred despite a 28% rise in gold prices and an even higher 36% increase in silver prices over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Some experts predict the price of silver to rise by another 28% by the end of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, with some even forecasting it could reach $100 an ounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Applications of Silver
Silver has been utilized as a store of value for over 5,000 years, with modern coins like the UK's Royal Mint 2024 1 oz Silver Britannia containing 99.99% pure silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. It is also used extensively in jewelry, as evidenced by ancient excavations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

However, unlike [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]] which is primarily used for jewelry and as a reserve, silver's demand is largely industrial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, finding its way into:
*   Mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   Laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
*   Space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   Renewable energy solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>
    *   Electric vehicles (EVs) use twice the amount of silver compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, with demand set to increase as the EV market grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   Solar panels are a vital component, with a typical 3x5ft panel containing up to 20 grams of silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. India imported over 4,000 metric tons of silver in the first four months of 2024, largely due to the rise in solar cell and module manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## [[factors_influencing_silver_prices | Factors Influencing Silver Prices]]
The value of silver is driven by three primary factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>:
1.  **Demand and Supply**: Specifically, supply has not kept pace with requirements for the last four years, contributing to an uptrend in silver prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
2.  **Industrial Output**: The level of manufacturing activity, monitored by indicators like the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index, directly impacts silver demand and price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
3.  **Inflation**: Generally, the price of silver shows an upward trend during periods of increased inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Silver's Performance and Volatility
Silver is a volatile commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Over the last 30 years, its price has seen periods of:
*   Stability (1990s to 2004) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>
*   Acceleration (600% rise over 6 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Decline (70% crash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
*   Current growth (20% CAGR since March 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>

Its volatility implies potential for significant gains if entry and exit points are timed properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Silver, like [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]], has provided strong protection during crises (e.g., Covid pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war), often outperforming equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Correlations
*   **Gold**: Silver has a moderately strong positive correlation with [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]], often moving in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Equities**: It has a weak correlation with equities, which turns negative during economic downturns, making it attractive when stock markets are volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Bonds**: During inflationary periods, silver tends to move in the direction of bond yields, making it a considered hedge against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Is Now the Right Time to Invest in Silver?
Several converging factors suggest a unique situation for silver investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>:

*   **Supply Deficit**: The market is experiencing the largest supply deficit in silver's history, which could tighten further in 2025 as production struggles to meet industrial demand from EVs, military equipment, and solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Growing Industrial Demand**: Solar manufacturers already consume about 20% of the annual silver supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. By 2050, solar panel production is projected to use 85-98% of current global silver reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Instability**: Global events (e.g., Russia, Iran, China, India, Middle East) encourage investors to seek safer assets like precious metals, including silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Purchases**: Traditionally, central banks have bought [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]] for reserves (e.g., Reserve Bank of India holding over 850 metric tons of [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. However, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation recently announced plans to purchase silver as part of its reserves, a move that could significantly raise silver prices if other central banks follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### The [[factors_influencing_silver_prices | Gold-Silver Ratio]]
The [[factors_influencing_silver_prices | gold-silver ratio]] is calculated by dividing the current price of [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]] by the current price of silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Traders use this ratio to identify opportunities for long or short positions in either metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

For instance, if gold is ₹8,174/gram and silver is ₹99/gram, the ratio is 82.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. A high ratio, like what was seen in March 2020, signals that [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]]'s price may drop relative to silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The long-term average [[factors_influencing_silver_prices | gold-silver ratio]] is around 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. When the ratio is significantly above 60, as it is currently, it theoretically suggests that silver might be undervalued and [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]] overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Historically, high [[factors_influencing_silver_prices | gold-silver ratio]]s have coincided with crises such as conflicts, pandemics, or stock market bubbles, often preceding economic recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## [[methods_to_invest_in_silver | Methods to Invest in Silver]]
While considering the current market dynamics, it's crucial to understand how to invest in silver:

### Physical Silver
Traditionally, silver is bought in physical forms like jewelry, bars, biscuits, or coins from jewelers or online stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Disadvantages for Investment**:
    *   **Impurities**: Deductions for impurities may occur during resale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   **Maintenance**: Jewelry requires regular polishing and shining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   **Storage Costs**: Holding bulk silver, often purchased due to its lower price than [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]], can lead to higher bank locker rental costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Digital Silver
Platforms offer the service to buy and store silver digitally, backed by actual physical silver held by the provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Considerations**:
    *   3% GST on purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
    *   Transaction costs may apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
    *   A significant differential (3-3.5%) between buy and sell rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Other Investment Options
*   **Silver Futures and Derivatives**: Offered by exchanges like MCX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

*   **Stocks of Silver Mining Companies**: Examples include Hindustan Zinc (a significant silver producer) and NMDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### Silver ETFs and Mutual Funds
These are recommended options for investing in silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) permitted silver-based financial products only in September 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

*   **How they work**: A silver ETF tracks the domestic price of silver, allowing investors exposure without holding the physical metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. These funds themselves invest in physical silver (30 kg bars of 99.9% purity), adhering to London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. ETFs and mutual funds fragment silver into units as low as 1 gram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: A unit of silver ETF can be purchased for around ₹95-₹96 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) are available for ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Key Metrics**:
    *   **Expense Ratio**: Most ETFs charge between 0.4% and 0.5% in expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
    *   **Liquidity**: Larger funds generally ensure sufficient liquidity for most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
    *   **Impact Cost**: Generally not a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### Benefits of Investing via Silver ETFs and Mutual Funds:
*   **Accessibility**: Units are affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **No Making Charges**: Unlike physical jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **No Storage Costs**: Eliminates the need for bank lockers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Helps diversify a portfolio, with 5-10% allocation to commodities like [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]] and silver being advocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Purity**: Backed by 99.9% pure physical silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: Adequate, with easy buying and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

In conclusion, the current confluence of high industrial demand, supply deficits, geopolitical uncertainties, potential central bank interest, and an elevated [[factors_influencing_silver_prices | gold-silver ratio]] suggests a promising outlook for silver as an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. This perspective, coupled with increasing household adoption of silver over [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold]], indicates a potentially significant opportunity for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

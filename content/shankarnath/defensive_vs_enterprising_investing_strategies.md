*The Intelligent Investor* by Benjamin Graham, first published in 1949, offers practical guidance for investors aiming to build a long-term [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investment strategy]] based on value investing principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. While the book does not teach how to "beat the market" in the conventional sense, it focuses on minimizing losses, maximizing sustainable gains, and controlling self-defeating investment behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The book's timeless wisdom has been endorsed by figures like Warren Buffett, who considers it "the best book on investing ever written" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Investment vs. Speculation

Benjamin Graham clearly distinguishes between investing and speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He defines investing as an activity characterized by:
*   **Fundamental analysis of companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Deliberate protection from serious losses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Seeking adequate returns rather than extraordinary performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Any operation that fails to meet these three requirements is deemed speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Modern examples of speculative activities, according to Graham's principles, include cryptocurrencies, NFTs, GameFi tokens, virtual real estate, and some AI-related investments that are not fully understood by most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## The Investor Types: Defensive vs. Enterprising

Graham categorizes investors into two main types: the defensive investor and the enterprising investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### The Defensive Investor

A defensive investor is someone who:
*   Maintains a long-term portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   Lacks the time to research and analyze individual companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Prefers to put their investments on "autopilot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

This type represents the majority of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Graham's approach for building a [[defensive_stocks_and_portfolio_strategies | defensive portfolio]] involves four key steps:

1.  **Decide on a Stock-to-Bond Split:** Determine an asset allocation ratio (e.g., 50/50, 60/40) based on individual life situation and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Graham discussed asset allocation as early as the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
2.  **Restore Allocation Regularly:** Rebalance the portfolio once or twice a year to maintain the desired stock-to-bond ratio. For instance, if stocks grow to 70% of the portfolio, and the target is 60/40, sell some stocks and buy bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This rebalancing is a disciplined practice often neglected by investors today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
3.  **Invest Fixed Amounts Regularly:** Invest a consistent amount of capital at regular intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, a practice now common through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
4.  **Follow Eight Rules for Stock Picking:** For defensive investors, Graham suggests adhering to specific criteria for selecting stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, which include:
    *   Diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   Company size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   Current ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   Profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   Price within range of its net asset value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   A P/E ratio not higher than 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   *Note:* Some of these rules from the 1940s and 50s have "faded in light of how modern business and valuations work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. However, embracing principles of systematic investing, asset allocation, rebalancing, and incorporating ETFs or index funds can still make a defensive investor successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### The Enterprising Investor

In contrast to the defensive investor, an enterprising investor:
*   Aims to beat the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Actively researches and analyzes companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Requires significant patience, discipline, eagerness to learn, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Graham believed that most investors are not suited for this type of active investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. He generally advised against practices like day trading, foreign bonds, IPOs, and growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Graham particularly warned against growth stocks, whose valuations are based on less reliable future earnings rather than current earnings or net asset value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, which was relevant for the less developed financial system of the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

While the criteria for an enterprising investor are "a bit more relaxed than the defensive one," a significant addition is the requirement to study a company's annual report and other financial statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Core Investment Principles

Regardless of investor type, Graham's work highlights several fundamental principles:

### The Importance of Price

"No investment is good or bad, but it's the price we pay that makes it an excellent decision or a horrible one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. As Graham stated, "a great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for the stock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This underscores the need to assess the value of a business relative to its market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Mr. Market

Introduced in Chapter 8, Mr. Market is an allegorical character representing the stock market's emotional swings and herd mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Mr. Market is bipolar, letting enthusiasm or fear guide his daily offers to buy or sell businesses, often at wildly fluctuating prices without any underlying change in the business's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Graham's advice is to avoid reacting to Mr. Market's moods and to view a stock as an ownership stake in a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Investors should only invest when the odds are in their favor and they are comfortable holding the stock regardless of short-term price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Margin of Safety

Chapter 20 of *The Intelligent Investor* introduces the margin of safety, a concept central to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. It is a way of reducing the risk of being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Graham insisted that all investors should build in a buffer, like planning extra travel time for a meeting, when investing in any security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. While Graham provided a formula for intrinsic value calculation (combining EPS, growth rate, and corporate bond yield), this formula, updated in 1974, is considered outdated for modern companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. However, the *concept* of margin of safety remains crucial, with a suggested minimum of a 30% margin before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### Inverse Understanding of Risk and Return (Value Investing)

Contrary to classical finance, which posits a positive correlation between risk and reward, Benjamin Graham suggests that in a value portfolio, the greater the potential for reward, the lesser the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This foundational principle of value investing implies that buying an asset far below its intrinsic worth offers both higher potential returns and reduced downside risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

*The Intelligent Investor* continues to provide valuable lessons on discipline, patience, and maintaining a long-term perspective in investing, remaining as relevant today as it was when first published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

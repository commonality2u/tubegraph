When markets experience a downturn and assets like equities, [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual funds]], and stocks become cheaper, it can be challenging to find funds to invest without selling existing holdings at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While options like [[benefits of loans against mutual funds compared to personal loans | personal loans]] or credit cards exist, they are often very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. A third, more advantageous option is a loan against [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual funds]] (LAMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This type of loan does not require liquidating your [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual funds]], charges interest only on the money used, allows you to retain any dividends, and offers a much lower [[interest_rates_and_fees_associated_with_loans_against_mutual_funds | interest rate]] than [[benefits of loans against mutual funds compared to personal loans | personal loans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## How a Loan Against Mutual Funds Works

Like any secured loan, the process involves three key steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>:
1.  **Estimating Loan Eligibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>: The loan eligibility limit is determined by the value of your [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual fund]] corpus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  **Pledging Mutual Fund Units** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>: Your [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual fund]] units are pledged to the loan provider, who then places a lien over these units in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  **Loan Disbursement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>: The loan amount can be transferred to your account via NEFT or, more commonly, made available as a credit limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Your [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual fund]] units serve as security until the loan is repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. If the loan cannot be repaid, the provider has the right to sell the units to recover their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Eligibility for Loans Against Mutual Funds

Anyone over the age of 18 who has money invested in [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual funds]] can apply for a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, final disbursement is subject to the loan provider's terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Applicant Types and Fund Schemes
*   **Equity Mutual Funds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>: Most loan providers allow only individuals to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   [[understanding_debt_mutual_funds_and_bond_investments | **Debt Mutual Funds**]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>: Lenders are more flexible, accepting units from individuals, partnerships, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), sole proprietors, and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Many institutions, including popular banks like HDFC, State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, and Bank of Baroda, as well as large NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Tata Capital, offer LAMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. However, the range of [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual fund]] schemes they accept can be surprisingly limited, often based on an approved list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. For example, ICICI Bank and SBI only accept schemes where the AMC is registered with CAMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Each bank and NBFC will have its own terms and conditions and approved schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Loan Limits
The loan amount an investor is eligible for largely depends on two factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>:
1.  **Type of Mutual Fund Scheme** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>:
    *   For [[understanding_debt_mutual_funds_and_bond_investments | debt funds]], lenders typically offer a loan limit of up to 80% of the Net Asset Value (NAV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   For equity funds, this limit is usually around 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
2.  **Lender's Internal Policies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>: These policies, including internal guidelines and pricing, can cause the eligibility amount and percentage to vary between providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Certain schemes, like ELSS (tax saver funds), may not be eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Application Process

There are two primary methods for applying for a LAMF:

### Offline Method (Complex)
The traditional offline method is often time-consuming and involves several steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>:
*   Approaching a bank or agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Submitting KYC documents (address proof, photographs, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   Providing a [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual fund]] holding statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   Signing a pledge form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   In some cases, submitting income proof like Form 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

This process involves extensive document collection and verification, followed by sending details to underwriters, loan processing teams, and registrars for lien marking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Online Method (Efficient)
The faster and easier way to apply for LAMF is online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. With institutions like banks, NBFCs, CAMS, KFintech, DigiLocker, and Aadhaar integrated via APIs, the entire process—from application and lien marking to loan processing and receiving funds—is fully digital and can be completed in minutes or hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

It partners with major NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Tata Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

The process on [[digital_platforms_for_managing_loans_against_mutual_funds | Yeno]] includes:
1.  **Eligibility Check** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>: Users can check their eligibility by entering PAN details and OTPs, which typically takes about 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
2.  **Loan Amount Selection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>: Select the desired loan amount up to the eligible limit. This can be increased later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
3.  **Scheme Selection for Lien Marking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>: The system may automatically select suitable [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual fund]] schemes for pledging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
4.  **Review Loan Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>: A one-time processing fee (e.g., ₹1179 including GST) is charged only on the first transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Subsequent withdrawals do not incur this charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
5.  **Document Fetching (DigiLocker)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>: [[digital_platforms_for_managing_loans_against_mutual_funds | Yeno]] utilizes DigiLocker for fetching necessary documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
6.  **Bank and Personal Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>: Provide required banking and personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
7.  **E-Agreement and E-Mandate Registration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>: Review and electronically sign loan agreements and register for e-mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
8.  **Video KYC** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>: A video KYC process is conducted for identity verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

After these steps, the credit limit becomes available on the app, often within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Users can then manage their loan, including changing credit limits, prepaying, or withdrawing funds, directly from the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Funds withdrawn can hit the account within a few hours, even on weekends (though it might take slightly longer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Nature of Loan Disbursement (Credit Limit)
Unlike [[benefits of loans against mutual funds compared to personal loans | personal loans]] where the entire amount is transferred, LAMF typically provides an overdraft limit via a current account (for banks) or a credit limit (for NBFCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This means [[interest_rates_and_fees_associated_with_loans_against_mutual_funds | interest]] is charged only on the amount actually withdrawn, not the entire approved limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This flexibility is a significant advantage, particularly for individuals with fluctuating cash flows, as it allows for borrowing only what is needed and repaying without prepayment charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Important Considerations and FAQs

### Returns on Pledged Investments
Yes, you will continue to make returns on your pledged [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual funds]] in the form of capital appreciation and dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This is a key reason to consider LAMF for temporary money requirements instead of redeeming units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### Safety of Funds with Platforms
Loans against [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual funds]] are regulated by the RBI, with strict compliance rules for all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Platforms like [[digital_platforms_for_managing_loans_against_mutual_funds | Yeno]] do not hold your pledged [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual funds]]; your holdings remain with the registrars (CAMS and KFintech), where a lien is marked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

### Impact of Market Fluctuations on Credit Limit
Lenders (banks and NBFCs) conduct periodic reviews of the fund value and corresponding credit limit, often on a weekly or fortnightly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. If the market crashes significantly, reducing the value of your pledged corpus, your eligible credit limit would also decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. If you have already maxed out your original limit, you might need to immediately pay the difference to the lender and work out a plan to bring the credit limit percentage to an acceptable level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### [[interest_rates_and_fees_associated_with_loans_against_mutual_funds | Interest Rates]] and Fees
[[interest_rates_and_fees_associated_with_loans_against_mutual_funds | Interest rates]] for LAMF generally range from 10% to 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. For example, [[digital_platforms_for_managing_loans_against_mutual_funds | Yeno]] currently offers 10.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Beyond the one-time processing charge, reputable platforms typically do not levy foreclosure, withdrawal, or prepayment fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. However, some lenders may apply additional charges in exceptional circumstances like bounces or liquidation penalties, which are detailed in the lender's agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

While LAMF is popular among High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs), it has not yet reached a mass retail audience who still often rely on more expensive [[benefits of loans against mutual funds compared to personal loans compared to personal loans | personal loans]] and credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. However, [[digital_platforms_for_managing_loans_against_mutual_funds | digital platforms]] are making this product more accessible and efficient for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

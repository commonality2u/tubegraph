The trending value strategy, a robust investment approach, combines elements of both momentum and value investing to identify stocks with significant outperformance potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:58">[03:00:58]</a>. This strategy has demonstrated a remarkable ability to outperform broader market indices over extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.

## Historical Performance Highlights

A portfolio of 25 stocks selected using the trending value strategy delivered an annualized gain of 96.9% over approximately 11 months, significantly outperforming the Nifty 50 (30% gain), Midcap 150 index (52% increase), and even factor funds like momentum and Alpha (Nifty 50 delivered 82%) during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Over 45 years, from 1964 to 2009, the strategy yielded annualized returns of 21.1% compared to the S&P 500's 9.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. A $10,000 investment in 1964 would have grown to over $69 million by 2009, showcasing the strategy's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Origin and Core Concept

The concept of trending value was first introduced by James O'Shaughnessy in his book, *What Works on Wall Street* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. The strategy relies on two key elements:
*   **Trending (Momentum)**: Refers to stocks that are already showing an upward price movement, catching the market's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Value**: Involves [[identifying_high_growth_potential_companies | fundamentally strong yet undervalued companies]] that the market has not yet fully recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

The objective is to maximize the potential of both [[momentum_and_value_investing | momentum investing and value investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Performance Comparison of Investment Strategies (45-Year Backtest)

O'Shaughnessy's backtest over 45 years revealed the following annualized returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>:
*   **S&P Index**: Approximately 11.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>
*   **Momentum Only Strategy**: 14.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>
*   **Undervalued Stocks (Value Composite 2 Indicator)**: 17.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>
*   **Combination of Value and Momentum (Trending Value Strategy)**: 21.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>

## Constructing a Trending Value Portfolio

The construction of a trending value portfolio involves a systematic approach, often using a stock analysis platform like Ticker Tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### Part 1: Calculating the Value Score

The value score is derived from a combination of six financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>:

1.  **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)**: Current market price per share divided by earnings per share. A lower P/E is preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)**: Useful for capital-intensive businesses. Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
3.  **Price-to-Cash Flow from Operations**: A low number indicates an attractive business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
4.  **Price-to-Sales (P/S)**: O'Shaughnessy's preferred metric. Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
5.  **EV/EBITDA Ratio (Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)**: Enterprise Value (market cap + net debt) divided by EBITDA. A lower number is preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
6.  **Dividend Yield**: A higher dividend yield is more favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

**Methodology Steps**:

*   **Step 1: Define the Universe**: Select companies with a minimum market capitalization, e.g., at least 500 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. This filters the universe of stocks to a manageable yet relevant base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
*   **Step 2: Extract the Six Metrics**: Utilize a screener (like Ticker Tape's valuation filter) to pull data for all six metrics for the defined universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
*   **Step 3: Download Information**: Export the data into a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel from CSV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.
*   **Step 4: Allocate Deciles for Each Metric**:
    *   For each metric (e.g., P/E ratio), sort the companies in ascending order (for P/E, P/B, P/CF, P/S, EV/EBITDA) or descending order (for Dividend Yield) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
    *   Divide the sorted list into 10 deciles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
    *   Assign a score from 1 to 10 to each company based on its decile rank. For metrics where lower is better (P/E, P/B, etc.), the lowest decile (e.g., rank 1-184 out of 1840 companies) gets a score of 1, the next decile gets 2, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. For Dividend Yield, the highest decile gets a score of 1.
    *   Handle missing data or negative ratios by assigning the 10th decile (10 points) to avoid skewing the analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. A score of 1 indicates undervaluation, while a higher score (7-10) indicates the company is more expensive from a valuation perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.
*   **Step 5: Replicate for Remaining Metrics**: Repeat the decile allocation process for all six valuation variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Step 6: Calculate Cumulative Value Score**: Sum up the decile scores across all six metrics for each company. A lower cumulative score indicates a more undervalued company (e.g., a score of 6 is the lowest possible if a company falls into the first decile for all six metrics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

### Part 2: Arriving at the Momentum Score and Final Portfolio

1.  **Reduce Universe by Value**: Filter the companies to only those in the top decile (lowest cumulative value score) based on their combined value scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. For example, if there are 1,840 companies, select the top 180-190 companies with a value score ranging from 6 to 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.
2.  **Extract Momentum Data**: For this truncated list, extract the 6-month stock price return data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. While 6 months is commonly used, one could experiment with 3 or 4-month cycles depending on volatility comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.
3.  **Sort and Select**: Sort this list in descending order based on the 6-month price return (highest return first) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. From this sorted list, the top 25 stocks are chosen to form the trending value portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

## Additional Considerations for Implementation

*   **Number of Stocks**: While the number can vary, O'Shaughnessy's backtesting suggests a 25-stock portfolio generally yields the highest risk-adjusted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.
*   **Rebalancing**: The portfolio should ideally be rebalanced semi-annually. For a more aggressive approach, quarterly rebalancing can also be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. The rebalancing process involves repeating the entire stock selection methodology: pull a new list of companies, extract metrics, compute value scores, filter for top value deciles, combine with momentum metrics, finalize the top 25, sell underperformers, and replace them with new top-ranking stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. All stocks should be equally weighted in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.
*   **Company Characteristics**: The trending value strategy typically identifies companies with low valuation metrics (low P/E, P/B, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>. Often, these stocks also show a high Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), indicating efficient capital utilization and reducing the risk of a "value trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>. Tools like Ticker Tape's Value Momentum Score and Fundamental Score can provide external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.

## Performance in the Indian Market

A study by Capitalmind, which backtested the trending value strategy on Indian stocks from 2007 to 2023, confirmed its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>.
*   The study showed that trending value tends to be more of a [[strategies_for_smallcap_and_midcap_stock_selection | small-cap strategy]], with almost 90% of the identified stocks being small or micro-cap in terms of market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.
*   It delivered a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.6% over the 16-year period, while the Nifty 50 returned 9.9%, indicating a 10% Alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>.
*   Rolling returns over a 10-year period consistently showed outperformance compared to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>.
*   One observed drawback is higher portfolio volatility due to significant exposure to small-cap and micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.

Despite its volatility, the trending value strategy has consistently performed well across various global markets and remains a valuable addition to an investor's toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.

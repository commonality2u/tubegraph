Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are tradable securities that track various assets, such indices, bonds, commodities, or baskets of stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. As of 2023, ETFs globally manage nearly $11.5 trillion, and their popularity is growing, especially in India where assets under management have increased over 50 times since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This rise is partly due to the Indian government recognizing ETFs as an asset class in 2013 and the EPFO's decision to invest a portion of its inflows into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Understanding ETFs: Trackability and Tradability

The core foundations of any ETF are trackability and tradability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Trackability**: An ETF's value is derived by closely following and replicating the performance of an underlying asset or index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. For example, a Nifty50 index ETF mirrors the Nifty 50 index's performance, and a gold ETF's trading value is dependent on the price of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Tradability**: ETFs can be bought and sold on an exchange during trading hours, similar to stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This allows for real-time pricing and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Variety of ETFs Available

The ETF universe in India offers a wide range of options, allowing investors to build an entire portfolio using these funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. As of now, there are almost 200 ETFs available to Indian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Most are passively managed, offering clear investment objectives and low costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

Key types include:
*   **Broad Market ETFs**: These cater to the broader market indices like Nifty 50, Nifty Next 50, and Nifty Midcap 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Thematic ETFs**: Focused on specific sectors such as banking, auto, pharma, IT, and consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **Commodity ETFs**: Popular options include gold and silver ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   [[Smart Beta ETF Strategies | Factor-based ETFs]] / [[Smart Beta ETF Strategies | Smart Beta ETFs]]: These are gaining popularity and offer options around factors like momentum, alpha, low volatility, and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **International ETFs**: Allow investment in global markets, including indices like NASDAQ, FANG+ index, and Hang Seng <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Debt-based ETFs**: Cover various debt instruments such as government securities, PSU bonds, overnight funds, and state development loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

## [[Investing patterns and strategies | ETF Investment Strategies]]

ETFs can be effectively integrated into various [[Investing patterns and strategies | investment strategies]]. Here are some approaches where ETFs prove particularly useful:

### 1. Tactical Opportunities During Market Dips
ETFs are suitable for capitalizing on sharp, temporary market dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. For instance, during a significant market correction, an investor can quickly buy ETF units at a lower price and benefit from the subsequent rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. This is advantageous over mutual funds, where transaction processing delays might mean missing the opportunity for real-time pricing benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.

### 2. Expense Ratio Advantage
When the expense ratio between an ETF and its corresponding [[Comparison of ETFs and Mutual Funds | index fund]] or fund of funds is significantly high, opting for the ETF can be a cost-effective choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. Despite incidental costs like brokerage and demat charges, ETFs often remain cheaper due to their typically lower expense ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

### 3. Accessing Specific Markets or Factors
ETFs provide access to international indices or specific market factors that might not be available through traditional mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. For example, if an international index can only be invested in via an ETF due to regulatory limits or if a particular [[Smart Beta ETF Strategies | factor-based]] strategy is exclusively offered as an ETF, it becomes the preferred instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.

### 4. Diversified Portfolio Construction
A well-rounded portfolio can include a mix of actively managed funds, [[Comparison of ETFs and Mutual Funds | index funds]], ETFs, and direct stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. Each instrument plays a role in shaping and improving the portfolio's overall performance and diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. An ETF, being a diversified portfolio by design, can provide broad market or sector exposure at a fraction of the cost of buying individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Important Considerations for [[ETF selection and investment styles | ETF Selection]]

When evaluating ETFs for investment, consider these points:
*   **Total Expenses**: Beyond the expense ratio, factor in incidental costs like broker commissions, demat charges, STT, SEBI turnover fees, stamp duty, GST, the bid-ask spread, and market impact cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. More heavily traded ETFs (like Nifty50 or gold ETFs) generally have lower expense ratios compared to thinly traded ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: Assess how easily an ETF can be bought or sold. Low liquidity can lead to difficulty executing trades, especially for large orders, and may result in wild price swings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Always check volume data on stock exchange websites for the ETF you are considering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   **Tracking Error**: This measures the deviation between the ETF's performance and the performance of its underlying index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. A smaller tracking error indicates superior index replication and is more attractive to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.
*   **Impact Cost**: This refers to the potential cost incurred due to the prevailing liquidity conditions when placing an order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. It reflects how much an ETF's market price is influenced by the size of an investor's trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. Higher impact cost means lower total returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. This can be found on exchange websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.
*   [[Investment considerations for liquid ETFs including risks tracking error and taxation | Taxation]]: ETF returns are subject to taxation. Dividend income is added to annual income and taxed at the investor's income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. Capital gains taxation depends on the asset class and holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Equity ETFs**: Short-term capital gains (held < 12 months) are taxed at 15%. Long-term capital gains (held > 12 months) over â‚¹1 lakh are taxed at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Non-Equity ETFs (Gold, Debt, International)**: Post-April 2023 amendments, these are taxed at the existing income tax slab rate, regardless of holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[18:59:00]</a>.
    *   [[Asset allocation strategies | Asset Allocation ETFs]]: If equities are typically in the 35-65% range and units are held for more than 36 months, long-term capital gains (LTCG) rules apply, taxed at 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

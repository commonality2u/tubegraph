Analyzing financial metrics like sales growth, Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth, and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) is crucial for improving [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | investing decisions]] and identifying future "multibaggers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Studying a portfolio of 44 stocks that delivered over 1000% returns over nine years can help isolate reasons for their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This analysis combines various [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investing strategies]] and frameworks previously discussed, including Coffee Can investing, Peter Lynch's small-cap framework, the Magic Formula, Ambit Capital's 10-bagger framework, and the Monopolies portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

While many variables contribute to a company's success, this article focuses on key metrics such as sales growth, EPS growth, and ROCE, along with others like the [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratio]], [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | capital employed turnover ratio]], and cash flow from operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Sales Growth
Sales growth is a fundamental [[business_operations_metrics_in_stock_analysis | business operations metric]] for evaluating stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. A bare minimum target is 10% growth over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. "Superstar stocks" have shown strong performance, averaging a 10-year sales growth of almost 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

However, it's essential to be mindful of certain factors:
*   **Non-linear Growth**: A company's sales journey is rarely linear, with many ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For instance, Electra Green Tech showed a 10-year annualized sales growth of 31.6%, but a large portion of this growth occurred in the last two to three years, indicating inconsistent growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Volume vs. Value**: Sales figures are a product of volume and average sales value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. In Q4 2021, the FMCG industry saw a 9.6% sales growth in value, but a 2.6% volume degrowth, with the increase in value primarily due to manufacturer price hikes of 5% to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Understanding *why*, *when*, and *how* sales growth occurred is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## EPS Growth (Earnings Per Share)
Growth in Earnings Per Share (EPS) is a fundamental [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metric]] with a direct correlation to a company's share price increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Data across over 600 companies shows a positive correlation between EPS growth and share price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Companies that grew EPS by 15.1% over 10 years saw an average share price appreciation of almost 24%, meaning one rupee became eight and a half rupees in 10 years, excluding dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

For "Superstar companies," it is clear that no company achieved "10-bagger" status with EPS growth of less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The "sweet spot" for long-term investors aiming for significant returns is an EPS growth in the 20% to 25% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) is a popular metric favored by many investors and [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. It is recommended by strategies such as Robert Kirby's Coffee Can Investing (at least 15% ROCE), Saurabh Mukherjee and the Marcellus team, Ambit Capital reports, and is a pillar of strength in the Fragility Scorecard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:05:05]</a>.

For the 44 "Superstar stocks," a majority were above the 15% mark, with the average ROCE based on last year's data being 23.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Top performers have demonstrated an ability to increase their ROCE by a few percentage points over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. An increasing ROCE indicates:
*   Higher profits relative to capital invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   Strengthening of a company's competitive advantage, making it more attractive to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Companies with a consistently high [[value_of_high_return_on_capital_and_low_cost_of_capital | return on capital]] employed offer investors a better chance of achieving "10, 20, 30-bagger" returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Conclusion
Identifying companies with strong and consistent sales growth (over 15% per annum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, high EPS growth (over 24% year-on-year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, and a high [[earnings_yield_and_return_on_capital_metrics | Return on Capital Employed]] (around 23%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, along with other favorable [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation metrics]] and [[business_operations_metrics_in_stock_analysis | business operations metrics]], is key to increasing the odds of picking potential "multibaggers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. While no single company may meet all criteria, studying these characteristics based on historical data can serve as a useful reverse screening exercise for future [[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | stock performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

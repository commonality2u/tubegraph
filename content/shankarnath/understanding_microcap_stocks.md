## What Are Microcap Stocks?

Unlike large-cap, mid-cap, and [[basics_of_small_cap_investing | small cap]] stocks, there is no formal definition for what constitutes a microcap company [00:00:05]. However, if a formal definition existed, microcaps would form a subset of [[basics_of_small_cap_investing | small caps]], including companies ranked beyond the top 500 [00:00:12]. In numerical terms (referring to Indian context), this often means companies with a current market capitalization below 6400 crores [00:00:17].

Despite often being overlooked, many microcap companies are not completely unknown and can even be industry leaders [00:00:24]. Examples of known microcap companies include:
*   Borosil Renewables: A leading player in solar glass manufacturing [00:00:28].
*   Quess Corp: India's largest employer in the private sector [00:00:32].
*   SIS: A significant name in the security industry, with over 11,000 crores in sales in the prior year [00:00:37].
*   Other well-known names such as Symphony, Greenlam Industries, and JK Tyres [00:00:46].

Historically, many of the world's most successful investors have generated significant wealth by identifying stocks early in their development [00:00:57]. A proper understanding of microcap investing can help generate excess returns over time [00:01:08].

## [[characteristics_of_microcap_investing | Characteristics of Microcap Investing]]

The term "microcap" often evokes various emotions, some based on facts and others on misunderstanding [00:01:25]. It's crucial to examine the specific [[characteristics_of_microcap_investing | characteristics]] of these stocks.

### Lack of Analyst Coverage
Microcap stocks are often compared to "stealth fighter jets" because they typically fly under the radar of research analysts [00:01:40]. A study by Motilal Oswal revealed that 40% of companies in the Nifty Microcap 250 index receive no analyst coverage, and only 12% of these 250 stocks are tracked by five or more analysts [00:01:45]. This "blind spot" among institutional investors can create opportunities for individual investors to find undervalued stocks [00:02:00].

### High Insider Ownership
A unique characteristic of microcap companies is their high degree of insider ownership [00:02:11]. Nearly half of the companies within the Microcap 250 index have a promoter holding of over 60% [00:02:17]. This "skin in the game" from owner-operators is generally a positive sign for shareholders, assuming the promoter is progressive and ethical [00:02:23].
On the flip side, these businesses typically have very little "free float," which can make it difficult for large investors to acquire a significant stake [00:02:35].

### Liquidity and Volatility
Liquidity is a debatable point for microcaps, with two main perspectives [00:02:49]:
*   **Challenges**: Microcaps often have low trading volumes, making it difficult to enter or exit positions [00:02:54]. Bid-ask spreads can be wider, increasing transaction costs [00:03:00]. A lack of liquidity also leads to a higher degree of volatility [00:03:07].
*   **Opportunities**: Conversely, this illiquidity can be a major driver for achieving multi-bagger returns [00:03:13]. Many microcap stocks are inefficiently priced, and there is less competition from large institutional investors, primarily attracting retail and long-term investors [00:03:17].

### Performance
Over 18 years, the Nifty Microcap 250 index has performed strongly, coming in a close second among broader indices with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 16.5% on a rolling return basis [00:03:28].
*   **Volatility**: As expected, the swings in this index are high and wild over the short term [00:03:40]. However, over a longer period, it tends to stabilize in the 14-15% range [00:03:45].
*   **Market Conditions**: Microcaps generally perform best when markets are rising fast, as seen in 2007, 2009, 2014-15, 2017, 2020, and 2021 [00:03:54]. Conversely, they are the worst performers when markets fall, as experienced in 2008, 2011, and 2018-19 [00:04:09].
*   **Peak and Trough**: The movement of microcaps is highly volatile; among all indices, they generally peak the most and fall the most [00:04:21]. This high volatility is often considered the price one pays for potentially better performance [00:04:31]. Managing this volatility is possible to achieve high returns at both the index and portfolio levels [00:04:39].

### Other [[characteristics_of_microcap_investing | Characteristics]]
Beyond these major points, microcaps typically offer [00:04:49]:
*   A slightly lower dividend payout [00:04:51].
*   Less transparency and information flow from the companies [00:04:53].
*   A higher chance of promoter fraud, price manipulation, and pump-and-dump schemes [00:05:01].

However, the enduring appeal for microcap investors is the potential to pick a future industry giant like HDFC Bank, Titan, or Reliance Industries, leading to wealth multiplication by thousands of times [00:05:05].

It is suggested that microcaps should not be viewed as an isolated decision point but rather as part of an entire portfolio, with allocation determined by an individual's risk profile [00:05:27].

## [[microcap_investment_options | Microcap Investment Options]]

Investors have several ways to invest in microcap companies.

### Mutual Funds
A recent development in the market is the introduction of mutual funds specifically for microcaps [00:05:47]. For example, a Microcap 250 Index Fund was introduced by Motilal Oswal AMC, which covers a basket of 250 stocks with a market cap ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 crores [00:05:51]. This scheme is passively managed, replicates the Nifty Microcap 250 TRI, is well-diversified across sectors, and has historically outperformed most broad market indices in backtesting, albeit with higher volatility [00:06:05].
A 5-10% exposure to microcaps via such funds can be considered as part of a larger wealth-building portfolio [00:06:48].

### Actively Managed Products
Given the pricing discrepancies, lack of liquidity, and valuation gaps in microcaps, there is also a strong case for actively managed products [00:06:58]. These include:
*   **Portfolio Management Services (PMS)**: Some microcap-specific PMS offerings include those by Quant Central Micro Cap, Equitas India Opportunities Portfolio, Pipe Strategy by ICICI Prudential PMS, and a Small and Micro Cap Portfolio by SageOne [00:07:09]. However, the minimum ticket size for most PMS offerings is substantial [00:07:30].
*   **Smallcase**: A more affordable alternative to PMS [00:07:37]. Examples include offerings by Quant, Hidden Gems by Ceteris, a smallcase by Omkara Capital, and another Hidden Gems by Summit Capital [00:07:40].
Before investing, it's crucial to research these products, their construction, fund manager, fee structure, and redemption rules [00:07:54].

### Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Approach
The DIY approach involves investors actively selecting microcap stocks themselves [00:08:05].

## [[selection_criteria_for_microcap_companies | Selection Criteria for Microcap Companies]]

Ian Castle, a microcap-focused full-time investor, proposes seven essential [[selection_criteria_for_microcap_companies | selection criteria]] for identifying hidden gems [00:08:17]:
1.  The microcap company should be a **market leader** [00:08:29]. Examples include Tata Coffee, Borosil, Antony Waste Management, Sagachi Industries, and HPL Power Systems [00:08:33].
2.  It should be **run by "intelligent fanatics"** (iconoclasts) [00:08:42].
3.  The company should be **profitable and sustainably profitable**, capable of self-funding its growth [00:08:52].
4.  It should have **low or no debt** [00:08:58].
5.  Possess a **clean capital structure** with low amounts of warrants and options as a percentage of outstanding shares [00:09:00].
6.  Have **no or low institutional ownership** [00:09:07].
7.  The business should be **grossly undervalued**, ideally trading at a 50-60% discount to its intrinsic value [00:09:11].

### Hard Metrics for Screening
To translate these criteria into actionable steps for screening thousands of microcap companies, specific hard metrics can be employed [00:09:20]:
*   **Market Capitalization**: Limit the selection universe to companies with a market cap of at least 500 crores [00:09:36].
*   **Owner Operators**: Ideal if promoter shareholding is at least 50% [00:09:44].
*   **Growth and Profitability**: Aim for at least 15% growth in sales and 20% growth in profit after tax (PAT) every year for the last five years [00:09:50].
*   **Leverage**: Debt as a percentage of equity should be low, ideally 20% or lower [00:10:02].
*   **Capital Effectiveness**: Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) should be 20% or higher [00:10:10].
*   **Relative Valuation**: The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio should be lower than the industry's P/E multiple [00:10:19].

Applying such a screening process can significantly narrow down a large pool of microcaps to a manageable number of potential stocks (e.g., from 3,000-4,000 to 21 in an example backtest) [00:10:23].
Once screened, investors should look beyond the screener and conduct thorough fundamental analysis [00:10:34]. This includes examining annual reports, earnings transcripts, news, and research reports [00:10:42]. The screening process itself, however, can make stock selection much more powerful, often yielding companies with median sales growth and ROCE significantly higher than the initial screening thresholds [00:11:01]. For instance, a screener aiming for 15% sales growth and 20% ROCE might yield companies with median 5-year sales growth of 25% and median ROCE of 38% [00:11:01].

Further refinements can include using a grading mechanism or a ranking-based [[small_cap_and_micro_cap_strategies | selection of stocks]] (like the Magic Formula) [00:11:41]. In more developed markets, fund managers utilize additional metrics and factors like value, momentum, earnings, RSI, Piotroski F-score, and average trading volumes for their [[small_cap_and_micro_cap_strategies | microcap strategies]] [00:12:03].

## [[behavioral_aspects_of_microcap_investing | Behavioral Aspects of Microcap Investing]]

When working with microcaps, investor behavior is equally important [00:12:51]. Key investing rules, while seemingly basic, are powerful:

1.  **Patience**: Microcap investing requires significant patience, as it can take years for a share price to reflect a company's true worth [00:13:02]. Impatient investors may sell before the upside materializes [00:13:13].
2.  **Ability to Say No**: Investors must be picky and disciplined when selecting microcap stocks [00:13:19].
3.  **Phased Investment**: Avoid buying everything at once [00:13:28]. Ian Castle suggests investing one-third of capital after initial due diligence, the second third after meeting management, and the final third after management has executed at least 25% of their initial promises [00:13:31]. This allows for averaging up as conviction grows [00:13:48].
4.  **Differentiate Business vs. Stock Performance**: It's crucial to distinguish between a company's business performance and its stock performance [00:13:57]. In microcaps, EPS might double over three years while the share price remains stagnant, often indicating undervaluation and a good time to invest, unless fundamental issues exist [00:14:03].
5.  **Margin of Safety**: Provide a sufficient margin of safety, especially for microcaps [00:14:24]. This margin refers to the company's growth potential, seeking businesses that can grow profits by 300-500% over the next three years [00:14:32].

Investing in microcaps requires moving beyond simple screeners to spend time evaluating management, business models, and growth runways [00:14:50]. Checklists and forums like Valuepickr or Reddit can be helpful resources for ideas and thesis validation [00:15:01].

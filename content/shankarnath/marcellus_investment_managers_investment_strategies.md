Marcellus Investment Managers is a boutique asset management firm established in 2018 by Saurabh Mukherjea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The firm focuses on creating long-term wealth for its clients through various funds and portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Guiding Principles

The [[Investment philosophy and strategy | investment philosophy]] of Marcellus is built around four recurrent themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:

### 1. Polarization

Marcellus observes a significant market polarization where large companies are growing bigger, while smaller players are declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Data supporting this includes:
*   Of the trillion dollars of wealth created in the Indian stock market over the last decade, 80% came from just 16 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The top 10 Nifty companies account for 85% of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Over 70% of Indian companies report negative free cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

This trend is attributed to fundamental changes in India over the past 10-15 years, such as doubled road networks, 50x mobile connectivity, 4x air traffic growth, and initiatives like UPI, GST, and Jan Dhan Yojana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These changes facilitate national players consolidating power, thereby compounding at high rates (20-27% CAGR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### 2. Great Businesses Run by Great People

Marcellus prioritizes companies with strong ethics and governance due to prevalent issues like creative accounting, financial irregularities, and embezzlement in Indian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. They believe that only a small percentage of Indian companies (around 20-25 out of 1000) would pass a "governance washing machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. These "clean" companies have historically outperformed the Indian stock market by 10% year-on-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### 3. Consistent Compounding

The firm seeks businesses that exhibit consistent and non-volatile earnings growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. While finding such companies is challenging (e.g., only four companies consistently grew revenue by 10% for 10 years in the coffee can investing study) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, Marcellus prefers consistency for managing portfolio volatility targets and reducing entry point risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

For compounding, Marcellus prefers using free cash flow (FCF) as the primary factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. FCF represents the money remaining after all expenses and payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Companies with a high return on capital (ROC) typically generate high FCF. If a company has a 40% ROC and a 10% cost of capital (COC), it can achieve a free cash flow compounding of around 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Marcellus seeks businesses that can compound their FCF at 25-30% for 15-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### 4. Valuation

Marcellus considers the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio a redundant metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Their view is that if a company can grow its earnings and FCF by 25% year-on-year, it's acceptable to purchase its stock at a high PE ratio, even up to 80 or 100 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Examples include Asian Paints (24% CAGR FCF for 25-30 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> and Titan (40% annual compounding since 2000, justifying a PE of 200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

While value investors find high PEs difficult to accept due to challenges in predicting far-future cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, Marcellus counters this by focusing on:
*   Established companies with strong brands and market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   Businesses that are physical rather than digital, reducing immediate disruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   Analyzing the external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Marcellus does not ignore valuations entirely but gives them less weight than other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. As of the video, their CCP portfolio had a high PE of 58 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Portfolio Construction Strategies

Marcellus's portfolios, including Consistent Compounders, Rising Giants, and Little Champs, share common construction methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### 1. Forensic Accounting

This initial layer involves putting all eligible companies through a dozen accounting ratios to identify those with clean accounting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Metrics include operating cash flow to operating profits, contingent liabilities as a percentage of net worth, and capital work in progress to gross block ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Qualitative factors like board composition and related party transactions are also assessed to understand the company's "moral fiber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Research suggests that clean companies create more shareholder wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Approximately 40% of companies are eliminated at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Much of Marcellus's forensic accounting practices are inspired by the book *Financial Shenanigans* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### 2. Capital Allocation (Coffee Can Investing Principles)

Marcellus borrows from Robert Kirby's coffee can investing principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, seeking companies that have:
*   Achieved double-digit revenue growth every year for 10 consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   Maintained a return on capital employed (ROCE) in excess of their cost of capital (COC) for each of those 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

Data indicates that portfolios based on these filters often deliver over 20% CAGR with low volatility, similar to a government bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### 3. Competitive Advantage

The third layer involves identifying companies with strong competitive advantages, viewed from two perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>:

#### Competitive Moat
This assesses:
*   The depth of the business's competitive moat and its incremental deepening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   Pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   Investments made to build new drivers of revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

#### Management Quality
This includes:
*   Focus on the core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   Quality and tenure of management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   Decentralized execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   Board independence and succession planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

At this stage, extensive bottom-up analysis is conducted. For example, Marcellus explained Asian Paints' 27% annual FCF growth over 15 years through a waterfall analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>:
*   Sales growth (14% per annum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   Increase in operating margins (profits grew faster than revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   Working capital reduction (quicker payments received, later payments to suppliers, reduced inventory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   Reduction in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   Asset turns (efficient use of factories through automation and process improvements, contributing 4%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

This rigorous process, combining hard metrics and qualitative assessments, narrows down thousands of companies to 20-30 stocks that comprise Marcellus's portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Performance and Outlook

In its first 4.5 years, Marcellus has attracted over 10,000 crores in Assets Under Management (AUM) from more than 8,000 clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. However, the performance of the Consistent Compounders Portfolio has been "just par for the course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Barring the initial years (2018 and 2019), the CCP has underperformed the Nifty50 TR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Similar patterns are observed in the Rising Giants and Little Champs portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. This indicates that, like other active portfolios, Marcellus's offerings will have a cyclical existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Marcellus emphasizes that these portfolios are strictly for long-term investors who believe in their story, hypothesis, and methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

## Marketing and Communication Strategy

Marcellus employs an aggressive communication strategy, utilizing newsletters, webinars, YouTube interviews, and appearances on business news channels. This has helped them communicate their strategies effectively and increase their AUM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

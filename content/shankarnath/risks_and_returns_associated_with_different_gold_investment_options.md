Around 200,000 tons of gold have been mined since the beginning of human civilization, which is roughly the weight of the ship that was stuck in the Suez Canal for about a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Of this, jewelry accounts for roughly half, 20% is in the form of coins, gold mutual funds, ETFs, and similar instruments, 18% is held by central banks, and the remainder is used in items like smartphones, microchips, medicines, and tooth fillings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While some gold is for consumption, a significant portion is considered [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | investable gold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Why Invest in Gold?
Gold may not be for everyone, especially for staunch Warren Buffett fans, as he has expressed his dislike for it, though he has purchased approximately 3,700 tons of [[silver_as_an_investment_compared_to_gold | silver]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

However, there are several [[benefits_of_investing_in_gold | advantages]] to investing in gold:
*   **Historical Returns**: Over the past 40 years, gold has delivered a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. If an annual systematic investment plan (SIP) had been done, this number would increase to 10.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Downside Protection**: The price of gold has only fallen seven times on a year-on-year basis over the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The maximum annual fall in gold price has been 14%, which is considerably better than the BSE Sensex, which has experienced annual falls of 14% or more on seven different occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Lower Volatility**: From a [[risk_management_in_investing | risk perspective]], gold is significantly less volatile compared to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Hedging Tool**: Gold and stock markets often exhibit an inverse correlation, making gold an effective hedging tool for asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Gold tends to perform well during periods of stock market depression or financial crises, as seen in 1991-92, 2000, 2008-2009, 2020, and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Investors are generally advised to hold around 10% of their portfolio in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | Ways to Invest in Gold]]
Gold can be purchased in various forms:
*   **Physical Format**: Jewelry, gold coins, gold bars (bullion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Electronic Format**: Digital gold, [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | Gold ETFs]], gold mutual funds, and Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The following sections compare these [[comparison_of_physical_gold_digital_gold_gold_etfs_and_gold_mutual_funds | different ways to invest in gold]] based on their associated risks and returns.

## [[comparison_of_physical_gold_digital_gold_gold_etfs_and_gold_mutual_funds | Comparison of Gold Investment Options]]

### Physical Gold
*   **Availability**: Readily available from banks (gold coins) or local jewelers (ornaments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Indian households are estimated to hold 25,000 tons of gold, which is about 12% of all gold mined since mankind began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Risks**: Physical gold carries [[risk_management_in_investing | risks]] such as theft, tampering with quality, and potential loss during the making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Minimum Investment**: Can be bought as small as 0.5 grams for a gold coin, costing a little over 3,500 Rupees at current prices including profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Costs & Returns**: Physical gold, especially jewelry, incurs significant costs that eat into returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. These include:
    *   Design and making charges.
    *   Storage costs.
    *   A 3% GST.
    *   Insurance costs and bank locker fees.
    These combined can add 10% to 20% over the gold price, making physical gold a weak option from a return on investment perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: Generally not a problem; jewelers typically buy ornaments or coins and pay on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Tax Implications**:
    *   A 3% GST is charged upon purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
    *   Capital gains tax depends on the holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>:
        *   Less than 3 years: Taxed at the investor's marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
        *   After 3 years: Taxed at 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

### Digital Gold
*   **Availability**: Distributed by most fintech companies and accessible via numerous mobile apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Risks**: While it avoids physical risks, digital gold suffers from a major [[risk_management_in_investing | risk]]: lack of regulatory oversight. There is no SEBI, RBI, or other regulatory body supervising these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This lack of regulation is a significant drawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Minimum Investment**: Highly fractionalized, can be bought for as little as one rupee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Costs & Returns**:
    *   Attracts a 3% GST on purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   A significant difference exists between the buying and selling price (buy-sell spread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. For example, a 1-gram purchase at 6400 rupees might yield 6029 rupees upon immediate sale, a spread of 5.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This spread is justified by the company's costs, including storage, technology, transportation, and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Higher costs directly lead to lower returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   Expected return over a five-year period is estimated around 7.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: Most liquid option, units can be sold 24x7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Tax Implications**:
    *   A 3% GST is charged upon purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
    *   Capital gains tax depends on the holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>:
        *   Less than 3 years: Taxed at the investor's marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
        *   After 3 years: Taxed at 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

### Gold ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)
*   **Availability**: Can be bought on aggregator or trading platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Risks**: Gold ETFs are backed by actual physical gold with 99.5% purity, stored with a custodian bank in their vaults, and periodically valued as per SEBI guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This provides regulatory backing and ensures the financial instrument is supported by real gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Minimum Investment**: Requires buying at least one unit, equivalent to 0.01 grams of gold or about 60 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Costs & Returns**:
    *   Come with an expense ratio, typically between 0.5% to 0.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   Smaller costs like brokerage, Demat account charges, STT, and stamp charges also apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   If gold appreciates by 9% annually, Gold ETFs would yield about 8.4% (9% minus 0.6% expense ratio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: Can be liquidated during trading hours, though it might take a couple of days for the money to reach the bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Tax Implications**: Capital gains are now taxed as per the applicable slab rate, with no concept of a holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Gold Mutual Funds
*   **Availability**: Can be bought on aggregator or trading platforms and mutual fund websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Risks**: A gold mutual fund is an extension of the ETF structure, as most invest in one or multiple gold ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Minimum Investment**: Have a relatively low entry amount, requiring just 100 Rupees to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Costs & Returns**:
    *   Direct plan expense ratios for many gold mutual funds appear low (e.g., 0.1-0.2%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   However, the actual expense ratio includes the expense ratio of the underlying ETFs they invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. For example, an SBI Gold Fund might show a 0.1% expense ratio, but its underlying SBI Gold ETF has a 0.64% expense ratio, leading to a combined actual expense ratio of 0.74% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   Expected returns might be slightly below Gold ETFs, around 8.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: Can be liquidated during trading hours, though it might take a couple of days for the money to reach the bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Tax Implications**: Capital gains are now taxed as per the applicable slab rate, with no concept of a holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)
*   **Availability**: Time-bound, as RBI releases new tranches every few months with five-day buying windows, which can be accessed from the RBI website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Even if these windows are missed, SGBs can be invested in from a trading account as they are tradable on Indian stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Risks**: SGBs are not backed by physical gold; they are derivative instruments where the Government of India uses the price of gold to define the bond's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. When investing, the RBI promises to pay the maturity amount based on the gold price on that date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. There is little [[risk_management_in_investing | risk]] unless the Government of India defaults, aside from standard reinvestment and inflation risks common to all financial instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Minimum Investment**: Requires buying a minimum quantity of one gram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Costs & Returns**:
    *   Unlike other gold products, SGBs have no visible expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
    *   Investors who apply online and pay electronically are eligible for a per-gram discount of 50 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
    *   Offer a fixed interest of 2.5% per annum on the initial investment, credited twice a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This is a unique feature not found in other products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
    *   If gold appreciates by 9% annually, SGBs offer an expected return of over 11.5% (9% appreciation + 2.5% interest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
    *   SGBs clearly lead in terms of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**:
    *   Come with an 8-year maturity period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
    *   Early redemption is possible in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>:
        *   **Secondary Market**: Can be traded on the Indian Stock Exchange after six months of issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Due to low liquidity, these bonds often sell at a discount, which is good for buyers but not for sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Resources like sgpanalyzer.com can help examine discounts and yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
        *   **Premature Encashment**: RBI allows encashment after five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
    *   Loans can be taken against SGBs; for instance, the State Bank of India offers up to 20 lakhs with an LTV of up to 65% on the bonds' market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Tax Implications**: [[impact_of_government_policy_and_taxation_on_gold_investments | Taxation]] is a crucial factor for SGBs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>:
    *   The 2.5% annual interest received is added to one's income and taxed at the prevailing income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
    *   If the SGB is redeemed at its 8-year maturity, the capital gains are entirely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This tax-free rule applies regardless of whether the SGB was bought during its launch or from the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
    *   For premature redemption after five years (in the 6th, 7th, or 8th year via RBI), some sources indicate it is tax-free, while others state otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. It is advisable to consult a tax advisor for clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Conclusion
Gold holds a special place in India, with more goldsmiths than bank ATMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. When choosing a gold product, investors should consider their investment objective, the required holding period, and safety aspects, in addition to availability, [[risk_management_in_investing | risk]], starting investment, returns, costs, liquidity, and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

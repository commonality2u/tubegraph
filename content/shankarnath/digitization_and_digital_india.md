The Digital India campaign was launched by Prime Minister Modi in July 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Initially, there were many skeptics who considered it "empty promises" (jumla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. However, today, individuals benefit from high-speed internet and digital delivery of government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Key Initiatives and Impact

Digital India has transformed the country into a major digitization hub through various initiatives, including:
*   High-speed internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
*   Digital delivery of government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>
*   BharatNet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
*   Startup India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>
*   Biometric identity cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>

## The India Stack

Central to these efforts is the "India stack," a series of government-backed APIs that provide access to government IDs, payment networks, and secure data to third-party entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Startups and companies leverage this digital infrastructure to develop applications that offer consumers seamless access to services ranging from welfare payments to loan applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Examples of companies built on this framework include Paytm and PhonePe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, as well as social initiatives like Namay Yatri, an open-source ride-sharing app on the ONDC framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) played a crucial role in standardizing the [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | multicap funds investment strategy]] to ensure investors could access truly diversified portfolios. This move addressed the challenge of predicting future market or sector performance with confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Distinguishing Multicap from Flexicap Funds

Before SEBI's mandate, there wasn't a single mutual fund category that allowed investors to build a truly diversified portfolio across market capitalizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>.

*   **[[comparison_of_multicap_and_flexicap_funds | Flexicap Funds]]**: These schemes allow fund managers to allocate any proportion or percentage of assets across large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For example, a fund manager could choose to put 80% into large-caps, 20% into mid-caps, and nothing into small-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. While this provides flexibility, it didn't guarantee a balanced exposure across all market caps.

## SEBI's Mandate for Multicap Funds

Recognizing the need for a truly diversified option, SEBI, in September 2020, mandated the creation of a separate multicap funds category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

*   **Allocation Rule**: Under this mandate, every multicap scheme must invest at least 25% of its assets in large-cap stocks, 25% or more in mid-cap stocks, and similarly, 25% or more in small-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Fund Manager Flexibility**: While seemingly restrictive, this regulation still allows fund managers flexibility in their overall allocation beyond the minimums. They can opt for various combinations such as 50% large, 25% mid, 25% small (50:25:25), or 40:30:30, or even 33:33:33, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This means they can dynamically allocate the remaining 25% based on market conditions and growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Stock Selection**: Fund managers can pick specific stocks within all three categories (large, mid, and small cap), aiming to invest in the most ideal companies within each segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Benefits of SEBI's Mandate

This regulatory framework is seen as beneficial for investors because it:
*   Ensures a disciplined approach to investing across different market capitalizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   Provides good control over allocations and navigates the dynamic nature of the Indian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Benchmarking Multicap Funds

Most multicap schemes, including new offerings, use the Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25 index as their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This index is considered the most suitable as its design closely aligns with how a multicap fund is structured, unlike the Nifty 500, which is primarily large-cap focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

*   [[performance_analysis_of_multicap_indices | Performance analysis of multicap indices]] indicates that the multicap index has historically outperformed the Nifty 500 and Nifty 50 across many years on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   When examining rolling returns, the average and median have consistently stayed around 13%, which is 1-1.5% higher than the Nifty 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Long-term periods (7, 10, 15 years) show a strong probability of achieving returns in the 12-16% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

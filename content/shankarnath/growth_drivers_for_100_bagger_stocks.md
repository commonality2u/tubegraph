From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

The term "100 bagger" originated from Peter Lynch's book *One Up on Wall Street*, where he used "10 bagger" to describe stocks that had multiplied in value by 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. India has seen numerous 100-baggers over the years, with ICICI Securities identifying 33 companies, three of which (Pi Industries, Kei Industries, and Bajaj Finance) even became 1,000-baggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The concept extends beyond individual stocks to indices, such as the BC Sensex, which became a 100-bagger by February 2006 and is now a 700-bagger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Mutual funds like Franklin India Blue Chip, HDFC Tax Saver, and Neon India Growth Fund have also delivered multi-bagger returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Christopher Mayer's Study on 100 Baggers

The [[concept_of_100_bagger_stocks | concept of 100 bagger stocks]] was deeply explored by Christopher Mayer in his book, which analyzed thousands of companies from 1962 to 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He narrowed his study to 365 companies that had delivered a 100-times return on a $1 investment, including well-known names like Walmart, Coca-Cola, Boeing, and IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway topped Mayer's list with an 18,000-times return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Key findings from Mayer's study include:
*   **Diversity**: The list of 100-baggers was diverse, spanning various company types and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Starting Size**: These companies were typically small but not extremely tiny when they started, with a median market capitalization of about $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Time Horizon**: On average, it took 26 years for a company to become a 100-bagger, which translates to a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While 60 out of 365 companies achieved 100x returns within 15 years, more than half took between 16 and 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This highlights the importance of long-term holding periods for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Holding stocks for very long periods, as seen in the coffee can investing strategy, significantly increases the chance of securing mega multi-baggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Twin Engines: The Core Growth Drivers

According to Christopher Mayer, two primary drivers, or "twin engines," propel a stock to become a 100-bagger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>:

### 1. Growth in Earnings
Over the long run, a company's earnings and its stock price tend to move in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. A higher rate of earnings growth directly translates to a faster journey to becoming a 100-bagger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   A business growing earnings by 10% annually would take about 48 years to 100x its earnings and share price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   At a 20% annual growth rate, it would take almost half the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   At a 40% annual growth rate, a 100-bagger status could be achieved in just 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
Thus, [[identifying_high_growth_potential_companies | finding companies]] with fast-growing earnings per share (EPS) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### 2. Growing Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Multiple
While earnings growth is essential, a rising P/E multiple is the second critical engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This "re-rating" signifies that investors perceive the company or sector as more valuable over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

**Example: Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL)**
*   Over 15 years, HUL's sales grew by 9%, net profits by 11.3%, and EPS by 10.7% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   However, its share price grew significantly higher at about 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   This extra growth stemmed from a P/E multiple expansion:
    *   Initially, HUL's P/E operated between 25 to 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   From 2012, its valuation was upgraded to a 45-55 P/E band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   In 2018, it saw another positive re-rating, shifting to a 65-75 P/E multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
This structural jump in P/E often results from improved earnings potential, better profit margins, reduced competition, or investors seeking opportunities in defensive sectors like FMCG during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

**Example: Reliance Industries Limited (RIL)**
*   For many years, RIL operated in a P/E band of 12 to 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   In September 2016, RIL's aggressive entry into telecommunications with Jio led to a stock re-rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   The investor community used Bharti Airtel's P/E ratio (25-40) as an anchor to re-rate Reliance Industries' P/E multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## [[christopher_mayers_six_characteristics_for_100_baggers | Christopher Mayer's Six Characteristics for 100 Baggers]]

Beyond the twin engines, Mayer outlines six key [[characteristics_of_multibagger_stocks | characteristics]] vital for [[identifying_high_growth_potential_companies | identifying future 100-baggers]]:

1.  **Start as Small Companies**: 100-baggers typically begin as small enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. It's improbable for an already large company like HDFC Bank (a $14 trillion company) to become a 100-bagger within 20-25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Therefore, investors should focus on smaller companies (e.g., up to 10,000 crore market cap) to find future winners, similar to catching Titan when it was valued at just 200 crores in 2001-2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This aligns with [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | investing in small cap and mid cap growth stocks]].

2.  **Super Long Growth Runway**: A company needs a prolonged period for growth and expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This includes not just market share gains but also the ability to develop new products, enter new markets, expand exports, offer new services, and thus create new revenue streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Reliance Industries, with its diversified interests from petrochemicals to telecommunications (Jio's broadband, satellite, OT, 5G, etc.), exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

3.  **Ability to Reinvest Profits at a High Rate**: A 100-bagger must be able to reinvest its profits back into the business and generate a high rate of return for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This emphasizes the compounding effect of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Mayer suggests looking for "capital compounding machines" that offer a Return on Equity (ROE) of at least 15% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. However, ROE should not be viewed in isolation; the business must also have significant growth potential, not just high returns from a matured market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

4.  **Strong Economic Moat**: To survive and grow for 20-30 years, a company needs a strong economic moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This is a structural characteristic that makes it difficult for competitors, allowing the business to generate high returns on capital over an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **Brand**: Coca-Cola's globally recognized brand makes it almost impossible to displace despite huge marketing budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
    *   **Intangibles**: Patents and intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
    *   **Switching Moat**: High costs or inconvenience for customers to switch (e.g., banks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
    *   **Low-Cost Provider Moat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
    *   **Toll Moat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
    *   **Network Effects Moat**: How platforms like YouTube and WhatsApp grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
    *   **Cultural Moat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   **Data Moat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

5.  **Consistent Track Record**: Winners tend to keep winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Building a 100-bagger portfolio from consistently performing companies is more reliable than investing in turnaround situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This consistency should be evident in gross profit margins (e.g., Apple's consistent 35%+ GPM), sales growth, EPS growth, debt levels, and capacity expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

6.  **Owner-Operator Companies**: Companies managed and operated by their founders, who are also significant shareholders, have better odds of reaching 100-bagger status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Examples include Reliance Industries, Wipro, and many companies within the Tata and Adani groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Owners with "skin in the game" tend to make superior capital allocation decisions, are disciplined about costs and debt, and focus more on cash flows than reported profits, leading to better share price performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## The Seventh (Crucial) Characteristic: Patience

Beyond the six characteristics, the most crucial factor for [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investment and portfolio growth strategies]] is patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Becoming the proud owner of a 100-bagger stock requires persisting with it for 15, 20, or even 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. In today's fast-paced, distracting environment, this "inaction" – staying put and not chasing the "next shiny object" – is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

Patience also applies to finding the right investment opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Having a proper [[investment_strategies_for_multibagger_stocks | system of investing]] ensures you don't miss potential multi-baggers or prematurely sell excellent businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Mayer advises being a "reluctant seller" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, echoing Phil Fisher's view that if a common stock is correctly purchased, the time to sell it is "almost never" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Conclusion: Vision, Courage, and Patience
To make significant money in stocks, one needs the vision to see it, the courage to buy it, and the patience to hold it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. While many investors settle for smaller gains, understanding the potential of 100-baggers can expand one's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. As the saying goes, "You only have to be right once to make it big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

To begin your search for potential 100-baggers, use a stock screener to experiment with combinations of market cap, Return on Capital (ROC), gross profit margin, and promoter holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Once a list of 15-20 companies is identified, undertake the thorough work of understanding their business, industry, growth runways, and economic moats to see which fit the 100-bagger framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. The rewards for this effort, if successful, will far exceed the initial investment of time and diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

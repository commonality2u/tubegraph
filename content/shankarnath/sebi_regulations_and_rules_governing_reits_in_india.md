In India, [[introduction_to_real_estate_investment_trusts_reits_in_india | Real Estate Investment Trusts]] (REITs) are regulated and monitored by the [[sebis_role_in_the_stock_market | Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (SEBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The concept of REITs is relatively new for Indian investors, with the first listing, Embassy Office Parks, occurring in 2019. Since then, only two more REITs, Mindspace and Brookfield, have joined, in 2020 and 2021, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Despite the slow start, [[sebis_role_in_the_stock_market | SEBI]] has been taking progressive steps to enhance the product's attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

While [[sebis_role_in_the_stock_market | SEBI]]'s rules can be intricate, there are three key regulations governing REITs that investors should be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>:

## Key SEBI Rules for REITs

### 1. Asset Allocation Rule (80/20)
[[sebis_role_in_the_stock_market | SEBI]] mandates a specific proportion for a REIT's investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>:
*   **80% of the asset value** must be invested in completed, income-generating real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This ensures that the majority of the portfolio is relatively safe and stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **The remaining 20%** can be allocated to riskier assets, such as under-construction buildings, equity shares, or mortgage-backed securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This portion carries more volatility and potential downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### 2. Mandatory Distribution of Earnings (90% Rule)
REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their net distributable cash earnings to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. For example, if a REIT earns 100 rupees in rent from its properties, a minimum of 90 rupees must be paid back to investors as dividends or interest, typically on a quarterly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This rule ensures a steady income stream for investors, with REITs generally offering a dividend yield of 5% to 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

### 3. Public Listing Requirement
All [[sebis_role_in_the_stock_market | SEBI]]-registered REITs must be publicly listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This allows retail investors to buy and sell shares or units in REITs on secondary markets through trading platforms, similar to how shares of listed companies are traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. The minimum buying quantity has been reduced to just one unit, making investments accessible from as low as 300 to 350 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

## [[tax_treatment_and_returns_on_reit_investments | Taxation Angle]]

[[introduction_to_real_estate_investment_trusts_reits_in_india | REITs]] in India benefit from certain tax exemptions on rental income and interest, which helps reduce their overall tax liability and generate higher income for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Investors earn returns from REITs through interest, dividends, return of capital (amortization of SPV debt), and capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

The taxation of dividends from REITs depends on whether the REIT's Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) opted for a lower tax regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. If the SPV chose government tax concessions, the dividend becomes taxable for the investor. However, if the SPV did not take these concessions, the dividend income may be tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. This means dividend tax treatment can vary between different REITs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. REITs provide information on their tax structure in their investor presentations, which can significantly impact post-tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

When [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | evaluating stocks]] and attempting to identify potential multibaggers, various financial metrics can provide crucial insights. This article delves into two such metrics: the PEG ratio and the capital employed turnover ratio, both valuable tools for assessing a company's valuation and operational efficiency. These metrics were used in an analysis of 44 stocks that delivered over 1000% returns over nine years, from 2014 to 2023, under the Narendra Modi government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The PEG Ratio

The PEG ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth ratio) was created by Peter Lynch and is considered a more comprehensive metric than just the [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. It takes a company's [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] and divides it by the expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate, thus incorporating both valuation and growth into the analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### Interpretation and Application
According to Peter Lynch, stocks with a PEG ratio of more than one are considered overvalued, while those with a PEG ratio of less than one are deemed undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

In the analysis of the 44 "Superstar Stocks," eight companies had a PEG ratio of less than one based on current data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. For context, the median PEG ratio for the broader Nifty 500 companies was found to be 1.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Therefore, exploring companies with a PEG ratio of 1.4 or less, particularly among the Superstar stocks, could be a worthwhile endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

However, it's crucial to remember that the PEG ratio is a dynamic number and should not be used in isolation, as it involves the [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] which is constantly changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

### Superstar Stock Criteria for PEG Ratio
A target for a "Superstar Stock" includes a PEG ratio lower than 1.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.

## Capital Employed Turnover Ratio

The capital employed turnover ratio is a metric learned from Ambit's 10-bagger framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. It indicates how effectively a company is utilizing its fixed assets to generate sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

### Interpretation and Application
A higher ratio is generally better, but its significance can vary significantly from industry to industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Therefore, it's essential to benchmark a company's capital employed turnover ratio against its industry peers for a meaningful comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

For example, within the Agro-processing sector:
*   Patanjali Foods operates at a ratio of 2.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   Gujarat Ambuja Exports is at 1.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.
*   Adani Wilmar and Google Agro are much higher, well above the industry median of 3.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:05]</a>.

In the analysis of the 44 "Superstar Stocks," approximately half of the companies had a capital employed turnover ratio above their industry average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. A deeper dive into stocks that generated over 4000% returns revealed a pattern: their capital employed turnover ratio was significantly higher than their industry benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Companies like Tanla Platforms, Kei Industries, Tata LXC, APL Apollo, and Deepak Nitrite exhibited this characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. This suggests that a relatively high capital employed turnover ratio is a positive indicator for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

### Superstar Stock Criteria for Capital Employed Turnover Ratio
A target for a "Superstar Stock" includes a capital employed turnover ratio which is higher than its industry average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | Evaluating stock performance using financial ratios]] like the PEG ratio and the capital employed turnover ratio provides critical inputs for making sound investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. While no single company among the 44 Superstar stocks perfectly met every criterion, these metrics, alongside others like [[importance_of_sales_growth_eps_growth_and_return_on_capital_employed_in_stock_performance | sales growth]], [[importance_of_sales_growth_eps_growth_and_return_on_capital_employed_in_stock_performance | EPS growth]], and [[importance_of_sales_growth_eps_growth_and_return_on_capital_employed_in_stock_performance | return on capital employed]], offer a robust framework for identifying companies with the characteristics of potential multibaggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. Integrating these ratios into an investment checklist can significantly improve the odds of picking successful stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

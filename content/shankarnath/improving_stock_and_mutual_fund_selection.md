Investing can become overly complex, with individuals often spread across numerous products like real estate, fixed deposits, gold bonds, [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual funds]], stocks, and even more speculative options like futures and options or crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This complexity can lead to a lack of understanding regarding the nature of products or their annual yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. By organizing one's way of thinking and applying specific techniques, it is possible to simplify the investment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Addressing Behavioral Biases

One of the primary sources of complexity in investing stems from emotions and biases, which can lead to suboptimal decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

*   **Overconfidence**: Periods of strong market performance, such as the Indian stock market from 2020-2023, can lead investors to become overconfident in their abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Recency Bias**: Investors may recall recent strong returns while forgetting previous periods of struggle, failing to recognize the full picture of their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

To simplify and mitigate these biases, consider these [[strategies_for_enhancing_mutual_fund_returns | strategies]]:
*   **Education**: Read articles on mental models and decision-making to build a robust framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **System and Checklist**: Follow a defined system for asset allocation, SIPs, fund selection, and investing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For stock selection, use a checklist outlining why you are buying, what you expect, and under what conditions you would sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Improving Mutual Fund Selection

A common source of complexity and suboptimal returns is the habit of chasing the best-performing [[approach to mutual fund selection | mutual fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

*   **Problem with Chasing Performers**:
    *   The set of best-performing funds changes annually, leading to a sprawling portfolio of many different schemes that are difficult to track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   Top-quartile (Q1) funds rarely retain their status in subsequent years; only one in four Q1 funds remain in Q1 the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Many top performers are more likely to move to Q2 (37%) or even Q3/Q4 (40%) in the very next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Over the long term, performance distortions get minimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Established schemes, even with different investing methodologies, tend to offer similar returns over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
    *   Instead of jumping between schemes, stick to a set of four to five schemes of different investing styles and remain invested in them for a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. For example, an SBI flexi-cap fund, despite being in Q1 only once in 10 years, delivered an 18.2% CAGR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Improving Stock Selection

While [[methods_for_analyzing_and_managing_stock_portfolios | mutual funds]] generally carry less risk of going to zero compared to individual stocks, a more careful and precise approach is required for [[stock_selection_criteria_inspired_by_peter_lynch | stock selection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

*   **Limit Holdings**: Don't get excited about every stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. A core holding of 10-15 high-quality, high-conviction stocks is easier to monitor and provides sufficient diversification benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Develop an Investment Thesis**: For every stock in your portfolio, have a clear rationale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This includes understanding:
    *   Why you are buying the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
    *   How the company generates revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
    *   Its growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    *   Associated risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Establish Investment Criteria**: Create your own simple investment criteria or checklist for stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This helps in choosing quality stocks, easing your mind, and allowing investments time to mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Examples of criteria include:
    *   Will the business be around in 100 years? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>
    *   Does the company possess a large and growing economic moat? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>
    *   Does the company have a history of responsible and shareholder-friendly [[management_analysis_for_stock_investment | management]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>

## Portfolio Management for Simplicity

Simplifying investing also involves effective portfolio management, tracking, and regular review <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

*   **Tracking**: Keep all investment information in one place, whether using an Excel sheet or an online portfolio tracker (e.g., Value Research Online, inMoney, imProfit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. This simplifies management and improves the review process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Review and Cleanup**: Regularly reviewing your portfolio (e.g., every 6 months) helps understand wealth growth, identify better-performing schemes, assess asset allocation, and determine necessary rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This process can help reduce the number of funds, consolidate schemes within the same category, and even improve portfolio performance by becoming more selective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Ultimately, an organized investor is a peaceful and confident investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

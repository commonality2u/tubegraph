While mutual funds have long been a popular investment vehicle, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have emerged as a significant asset class, particularly since 2013 in India, with global assets under management reaching almost $11.5 trillion by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. ETFs are tradable securities that track various assets, such as indices, bonds, commodities, or baskets of stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>. This article explores the similarities and differences between ETFs and mutual funds, especially index funds.

## Similarities

[[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] and [[approach_to_mutual_fund_selection | mutual funds]], particularly index funds, share several common characteristics:
*   **Portfolio of Assets**: Both are structured as a portfolio of underlying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:36">[01:31:36]</a>.
*   **Index Tracking**: Both typically track an index or a specific basket of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>.
*   **Low Expenses**: Both generally have low expense ratios compared to actively managed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:94">[01:37:94]</a>.
*   **Passively Managed**: For the most part, both are passively managed, aiming to replicate the performance of their underlying index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.

## Key Differences

Despite their similarities, several important distinctions exist between [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] and [[approach_to_mutual_fund_selection | mutual funds]] (specifically index funds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:30">[01:43:30]</a>:

### Impact of Inflows and Outflows
*   **ETFs**: When an investor buys or sells [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] shares, it does not directly impact other unit holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. New shares are created upon purchase, and existing shares are redeemed upon sale, adjusting the total number of shares without affecting existing shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>.
*   **Index Funds**: If an index fund investor buys additional units, it directly affects all other unit holders because the fund must purchase more underlying securities to meet the increased demand, impacting all investors proportionately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:24">[02:27:24]</a>. The same applies during redemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:40">[02:30:40]</a>. This is why fiduciaries often prefer [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Tradability and Market Listing
*   **ETFs**: [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] are listed on a stock exchange and can be bought and sold during market hours, similar to stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:89">[02:46:89]</a>. This allows for real-time pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>.
*   **Index Funds**: Index funds are not tradable on a real-time basis; transactions are typically processed at the end-of-day Net Asset Value (NAV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>.

### Demat Account Requirement
*   **ETFs**: A demat account is required to trade in [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:60">[02:55:60]</a>.
*   **Index Funds**: A demat account is generally not needed when investing in or redeeming index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:34">[02:58:34]</a>.

### Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs)
*   **ETFs**: SIPs are more aligned with index funds, though some stock brokers now offer SIPs for [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:86">[03:02:86]</a>.
*   **Index Funds**: SIPs are a common and widely available method for investing in index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:80">[03:00:80]</a>.

### Tracking Error
*   **ETFs**: [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] tracking error (the deviation between the ETF's performance and its underlying index) is generally lower than that of an index fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:68">[03:09:68]</a>. Lower expense ratios can positively impact tracking error, leading to higher returns for passive investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:64">[09:34:64]</a>.
*   **Index Funds**: While also aiming for low tracking error, index funds may experience slightly higher tracking error compared to [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:68">[03:09:68]</a>.

### Cost Structure
*   **ETFs**: [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] often have very low expense ratios, sometimes below 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:99">[05:40:99]</a>. However, investors must also factor in incidental costs like broker commissions, demat charges, STT, SEBI turnover fees, stamp duty, GST, and the bid-ask spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:05">[06:47:05]</a>. Heavily traded [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] like Nifty50 or gold tend to have lower expense ratios than thinly traded ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:72">[07:27:72]</a>.
*   **Index Funds**: While index funds also have low expense ratios, they typically don't incur the additional trading-related costs associated with [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:02">[03:14:02]</a>.

### Liquidity
*   **ETFs**: Liquidity can be a concern with thinly traded [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:81">[07:38:81]</a>. It might be difficult to sell units if there aren't enough corresponding buy orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Less liquid [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] can also display wild price swings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. The [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] impact cost, which measures liquidity risk, is a hidden cost to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:08">[09:43:08]</a>.
*   **Index Funds**: Liquidity is generally not an issue with index funds, as the fund house is obligated to honor every buy and sell order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:70">[03:25:70]</a>.

## Taxation
[[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] returns are subject to two types of taxation:
*   **Dividend Income**: Dividends received by the [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] are typically reinvested back into the scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. If dividends are credited to the investor, this amount is added to annual income and taxed per the individual's income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:10">[01:45:10]</a>.
*   **Capital Gain**: This depends on the asset class and holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>.
    *   **Equity [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]]**: Taxation is similar to equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>.
        *   Short-Term Capital Gain (STCG): If units are held for less than 12 months, taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>.
        *   Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG): If held beyond a year and earnings exceed â‚¹1 lakh, gains are subject to a 10% tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Non-Equity [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]]** (e.g., [[comparison_of_physical_gold_digital_gold_gold_etfs_and_gold_mutual_funds | gold]], [[leveraging_debt_mutual_funds and_etfs | debt]], international [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]]): Post-April 2023 finance bill amendments, tax liability is assessed based on the investor's existing income tax slab rate, regardless of the holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
    *   **Asset Allocation [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]]**: If equities are typically in the 35-65% range and units are held for more than 36 months, LTCG rules apply, with gains taxed at 20% with indexation [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_etfs | benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

## When to Prefer ETFs or Mutual Funds

Investors may strategically choose between [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] and [[approach_to_mutual_fund_selection | mutual funds]] based on specific market conditions or investment objectives:
*   **Tactical Opportunities**: [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] can be preferred during sharp market dips for tactical buying opportunities due to their real-time trading capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:98">[03:51:98]</a>.
*   **Expense Ratio Discrepancies**: If the expense ratio difference between an [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] and its corresponding index fund or fund of funds is significantly high, the [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETF]] might be chosen even with incidental costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Access to Specific Markets/Factors**: [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]] may offer access to international indices or specific factors ([[comparison_of_smart_beta_and_traditional_index_funds | Smart Beta]]) that are not available through [[approach_to_mutual_fund_selection | mutual fund]] or fund of fund options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

Ultimately, a diversified portfolio may include a mix of actively managed funds, index funds, [[introduction_to_exchange_traded_funds | ETFs]], and stocks, each serving a specific role in achieving investment goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

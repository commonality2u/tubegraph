This article explores the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | performance of large cap and small cap indices]], individually and in combination, to reveal strategies for maximizing returns.

## Initial Performance Overview

Historically, a rupee invested monthly in a large cap index since 2007 would have yielded a return of 12.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A small cap index, over the same period, performed slightly better, returning 13.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, combining these two indices — a mix of large caps and small caps — resulted in a "delicious" return of 16.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, significantly higher than either asset class in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This video aims to show how an investor can achieve an extra two to three percent on their capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Investment Interest

External events and their perception heavily influence investor interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For instance, investors who favored large caps during uncertain years like 2009, 2013, and 2020 were often the same individuals predominantly invested in small caps in 2007 and 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This suggests that a relative valuation range of 0.9 to 1.1 can be an important stock-picking trigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Data Collection Methodology

To analyze these scenarios, the first step is to collect the month-closing values of the Nifty 50 and the Nifty Small Cap 250 Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This data can be found on the NSE India website by navigating to Products > Equities > Historical Index Data, then selecting "Total Returns Index Value" and specifying the index and time period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A Google Sheet compiling the monthly Nifty 50 and Small Cap 250 closing values for the last 15 years, including various scenarios discussed, is also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Investment Scenarios and [[performance_analysis_of_multicap_indices | Performance Analysis]]

### Scenario 1: Individual Index Performance

Over the past 15 years, the Nifty 50 TRI achieved an annualized return of 12.8% using the XIRR formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The Nifty Small Cap 250 TRI, on the other hand, delivered a CAGR of 13.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. A 10,000 rupee monthly SIP over this period would have grown to 55.5 lakhs with the Nifty 50 and slightly over 60 lakhs with the Small Cap 250 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This highlights the [[historical_performance_and_valuation_of_small_cap_index | historical performance and valuation of small cap index]] funds.

### Scenario 2: Pausing SIPs During Overvaluation

Implementing a guardrail where SIPs are paused when the small cap index's relative valuation breaches an upper limit of 1.1 (indicating overvaluation compared to large caps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This exclusion covered 23 months, leading to a slight improvement in performance, with annualized returns reaching 14.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Redeeming Units During Overvaluation

Beyond pausing SIPs, actively redeeming or selling units when small caps are expensive can further enhance returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. For instance, selling 10,000 rupees worth of units every time the small cap level crosses 1.1 provided an additional 0.3% lift, taking the annual return to 14.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Scenario 4: Buy Low, Sell High Strategy

This advanced strategy involves not only selling when small caps are expensive but also buying when they are relatively cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The strategy involves:
*   **Selling**:
    *   Sell 10,000 rupees worth of units when the relative line crosses 1.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
    *   Sell an additional 10,000 (total 20,000) when it crosses 1.15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Redeem a total of 30,000 rupees at the 1.2 mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Buying**:
    *   Invest an additional 10,000 rupees when the number goes below 0.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Put in an additional 20,000 rupees at the 0.85 level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   Invest an additional 30,000 rupees at the 0.8 mark, on top of the regular monthly 10,000 rupee investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

This strategy, which defines both the action and quantum of investment/redemption based on relative valuation, delivered an impressive 16.3% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This represents a significant jump from the individual Nifty 50 TRI (12.8%) and Nifty Small Cap 250 TRI (13.8%) CAGRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This demonstrates effective [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | tactical approaches to maximize small cap investment performance]].

### Scenario 5: Long-Short Opportunity

When small caps are relatively expensive (e.g., at 1.1 or 1.2 levels), it implies large caps are relatively cheaper at the same points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This opens up a long-short opportunity, allowing investors to buy units in a Nifty 50 Index Fund simultaneously with redeeming units in the Small Cap 250 Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This relative valuation-driven approach not only yields a respectable 16% return over a 15-year period but also helps accumulate a larger portfolio corpus by generally remaining invested in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This shows how to improve [[performance_and_execution_of_investments_in_small_and_mid_cap_stocks | performance and execution of investments in small and mid cap stocks]].

## Key Considerations

*   **Taxes**: While there's no escaping taxes, a larger portion of capital gains from such a strategy would likely be long-term. The five percent difference between short-term capital gains (STCG) and long-term capital gains (LTCG) may not be a major concern for some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: If additional capital is not readily available for the scaled investments, some "slippages" might occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Basics of Small Cap Investing | Small cap investing]] is often more tactical compared to [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | investing in large caps]] or even mid caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. While Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are advocated even in small caps, taking full advantage of their volatility can significantly [[tactical_approaches_to_maximize_small_cap_investment_performance | maximize performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

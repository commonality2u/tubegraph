[[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | Coffee can investing]] is an investment strategy centered on identifying and holding high-quality stocks for extended periods, typically outperforming benchmarks across economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:10">[13:35:10]</a>. The term "coffee can" originates from the Old West (early 19th century), where people would store valuables like money and jewelry in a coffee can under their mattress for safekeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

The investment concept was accidentally discovered by Robert G. Kirby, who first wrote about it in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Kirby found that one of his clients, who had invested in every stock recommended by Kirby's firm but ignored sell recommendations, had accumulated a massive fortune over time by simply holding onto share certificates without actively managing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This accidental patience revealed the power of holding "multibaggers" â€“ stocks that appreciate capital multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

The success of this [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing program]] depends entirely on the quality of stocks chosen to be placed inside the "coffee can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>. The identification of such stocks is a primary quest for this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>.

## Key Characteristics of a High-Quality Business for Coffee Can Investing

To build a [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can portfolio]], the first step involves applying specific filters to identify a [[key_characteristics_of_highquality_businesses_for_coffee_can_investing | high quality business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:01">[03:15:01]</a>:

*   **Business Longevity**: The company should have been operational for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:01">[03:53:01]</a>.
*   **Revenue Growth**: The company must have grown its revenue by at least 10% *every year* over the last decade (not just a 10-year CAGR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:01">[04:01:01]</a>.
*   **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)**: This measures how efficiently the business uses its equity and debt to generate returns. An ROCE of 15% is considered ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:01">[04:24:01]</a>.
*   **Market Capitalization**: Companies should have a market cap of at least 100 crores (approximately $12 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:01">[04:41:01]</a>. This filter alone allows for over 2,200 companies in the Indian context, though most coffee can portfolios lean towards popular large-cap companies due to additional filters applied by investment firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:01">[04:50:01]</a>.

Additional filters often applied by investment firms include:
*   Steady positive free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:01">[05:13:01]</a>
*   High market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:01">[05:16:01]</a>
*   Low debt-to-equity ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:01">[05:19:01]</a>

## Steps to Develop Your Own Coffee Can Portfolio

1.  **Apply Initial Filters**: Use the criteria for longevity, annual revenue growth (10% year-on-year for 10 years), 15% ROCE, and a minimum market cap of 100 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:01">[05:23:01]</a>. This step can be challenging for individual investors, especially the year-on-year revenue growth check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:01">[05:33:01]</a>.
2.  **Identify 20-25 Stocks**: From the filtered list, select 20 to 25 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:01">[06:05:01]</a>.
3.  **Diversify Across Sectors**: Ensure the selected stocks are from multiple sectors to reduce sector-specific risk and increase the chance of catching one or two multibaggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:01">[06:10:01]</a>.
4.  **Invest Equally**: Allocate an equal amount of money to each stock. This strategy minimizes selection risk and gives every company an equal chance to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:01">[06:22:01]</a>.
5.  **Do Not Churn Your Portfolio**: The final, crucial step is inaction. Do not sell any of your [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can stocks]], do not rebalance, and avoid any activity that incurs transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:01">[06:36:01]</a>.

### Refining Your Stock Selection

Due to [[challenges_in_investing_with_coffee_can_strategy | challenges]] in perfectly applying filters like year-on-year revenue growth, many investors use proxies or additional filters. Gurjot Alwalya, for example, uses a refined screening process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:01">[11:16:01]</a>:

*   **Average Growth Filters**: Instead of strict year-on-year growth, use filters like 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year sales growth of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:01">[11:24:01]</a>. Apply similar filters for ROCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:01">[11:42:01]</a>.
*   **Exclude Cyclical/Commodity Businesses**: Blindly filter out companies from cyclical, commodity-based sectors such as steel, sugar, metals, infrastructure, power, capital goods, and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:01">[12:10:01]</a>.
*   **Avoid PSUs and Highly Regulated Sectors**: Exclude Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and sectors with very high regulatory control or compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:01">[12:27:01]</a>.
*   **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: After the initial filtering, apply a debt-to-equity ratio filter, preferably less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:01">[12:41:01]</a>.
*   **Promoter Holding**: Look for companies with unpledged promoter holding, ideally at least 40% to 50%, indicating strong "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:01">[12:49:01]</a>.
*   **Corporate Governance**: Research the management's track record, including any SEBI-related violations, fines, or criminal cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:01">[13:00:01]</a>.
*   **Current Valuations**: After applying all these filters, you should be left with 25-35 excellent businesses. At this stage, assess their current valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:01">[13:13:01]</a>.

## Implementing the Strategy: DIY vs. Professional Help

While it's possible to build a [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can portfolio]] yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:01">[06:56:01]</a>, it requires significant initial research and analysis to ensure the right stocks are chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:01">[14:06:01]</a>.

For those who prefer [[professional_portfolio_management_services_offering_coffee_can_investment_strategies | professional help]], Portfolio Management Services (PMS) companies like Ambit and Marcellus offer such portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:01">[07:14:01]</a>. Ambit Asset Management has offered a coffee can portfolio since March 2017, typically holding 10-15 large-cap stocks like Asian Paints, ICICI Bank, TCS, HDFC Bank, and Pidilite Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:01">[07:23:01]</a>. Marcellus Investment Managers, headed by Saurabh Mukherjee, offers a "Consistent Compounders portfolio" (CCP) that heavily borrows from the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:01">[08:34:01]</a>. These PMS offerings typically have a minimum investment size of at least 50 lakh rupees (approx. $60,000 USD), making them unsuitable for most individual investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:01">[09:35:01]</a>.

Alternatively, platforms like Smallcase (though not specifically branded as coffee can) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:01">[10:05:01]</a> or user-generated screeners on platforms like Screener.in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:01">[10:20:01]</a> can assist in identifying potential companies, though they may have limitations in applying all the precise criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:01">[10:39:01]</a>. Forums like Valuepickr and Twitter are also sources for shared knowledge and stock ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:01">[11:05:01]</a>.

## Considerations for Building a Coffee Can Portfolio

*   **Initial Research**: The strategy demands substantial initial research and analysis to ensure the selection of truly high-quality stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:01">[14:06:01]</a>.
*   **Missing New Companies**: Since the strategy relies on businesses with 10+ years of operation, one might miss out on catching new companies and industries in their infancy, potentially missing significant multibaggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:01">[13:52:01]</a>. This is one of the key [[challenges_and_considerations_in_implementing_a_coffee_can_investment_strategy | Challenges and considerations in implementing a coffee can investment strategy]].

If [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can investing]] appeals to you, it's advisable to allocate a portion of your portfolio, perhaps a maximum of 10%, to this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:01">[14:22:01]</a>.

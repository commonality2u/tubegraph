The concept of [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | Shameless cloning]] was introduced by Mohnish Pabrai, who often builds his portfolio by leveraging the high-conviction ideas of other successful investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the idea of [[shameless_cloning_strategy | shameless cloning]] offers a path to potential profits, several [[challenges_and_lessons_in_investing | challenges and lessons in investing]] and considerations exist for investors seeking to implement this strategy.

## Lack of a Clear, Replicable System
Despite the insights from experts and numerous investment ideas available, a clear, understandable, and replicable system for putting together a profitable portfolio through cloning has historically been missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Mohnish Pabrai himself did not explicitly share a detailed method for cloning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Identifying Reliable Information Sources
In the current information-saturated environment, discerning whom to trust among thousands of self-proclaimed investors on various platforms (news channels, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. A substantial portion of online information can be misleading, with many offering fluid opinions rather than verified facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Verification of Investment Intent
A critical consideration is verifying the actual investment intent of these "superstar" investors. Public statements or recommendations might not always align with their actual portfolio holdings.
*   The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced a rule in 2016 requiring publicly listed companies to disclose shareholders holding more than 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This official disclosure acts as a verifiable anchor and a strong indicator of an investor's true commitment to a stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   It is crucial to "trust but verify" by cross-referencing public statements with official shareholding patterns available on stock exchange websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Methodological Assumptions and Manual Intervention
Creating a [[portfolio_building_and_monitoring_techniques | cloned portfolio]] involves several methodological choices and requires manual intervention:
*   **Investor Selection:** From platforms listing many "superstar" shareholder portfolios, a selective choice of key investors must be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Pruning Stock Lists:** The initial list of stocks held by chosen investors can be extensive (e.g., 370+ stocks), necessitating a process to narrow it down to a manageable number (e.g., around 50 stocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Defining Conviction:** "Conviction" can be defined in various ways. While some might consider the monetary value of holdings, one approach is to define it based on the percentage of shareholding an investor holds in a company, which might prioritize smaller, high-percentage stakes over larger, lower-percentage value investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Variable Selection:** Dozens of other variables could be used for stock selection, such as the size of the corpus, the age of the investment, momentum, or percentage change in holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The choice of variables introduces subjectivity.
*   **Data Accuracy and Tools:** Using multiple tools (e.g., Google Finance, ChatGPT for stock codes) can lead to minor errors, such as changed company names or incorrect stock codes, necessitating manual cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Information Lag:** Shareholding information is typically disclosed with a delay of 2-3 weeks from the end of the quarter, which can impact real-time investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Portfolio Characteristics and Risks
*   **Small and Micro Caps:** A significant proportion of stocks in a cloned portfolio, especially those where investors hold a high percentage, might be small-cap or micro-cap companies (e.g., over 80% in one simulation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. These companies are often more volatile, requiring a higher risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Inherent Losses:** Even with high-conviction bets from top individual investors, a cloned portfolio will still experience losses. For example, in one simulation, 35% (20 out of 57) of the stocks were exited at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This highlights that even seasoned investors make mistakes, and one must be prepared for a portion of investments not to perform as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Implementing as a Fund
It is unlikely to find a mutual fund or small case specifically built around a [[shameless_cloning_strategy | shameless cloning strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   A fund house would find it difficult to justify a decent expense ratio for simply copying others' portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   Copying might not be perceived positively on a fund manager's resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Despite these challenges, the [[performance_of_copycat_investing_strategy | performance of copycat investing strategy]] can be significant, with simulated annualized returns potentially outperforming major indices and actively managed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This suggests that with careful consideration of the above points, [[investment and portfolio growth strategies | investment and portfolio growth strategies]] based on cloning can be viable.

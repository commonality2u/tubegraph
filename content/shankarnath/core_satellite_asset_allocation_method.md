The [[core_and_satellite_portfolio_structure | core satellite asset allocation method]] is an approach to [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] that involves dividing an investment portfolio into two main components: a core holding and a satellite holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Components of the Method

### Core Holding
The core holding consists of broadly diversified investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Its primary design is to provide stability to the portfolio and reduce overall risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. For example, a core portfolio might be set up with a comfortable mix of equities, gold, and debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. This part of the portfolio is intended to generate consistent, steady returns, such as 11.5% to 12% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Satellite Holding
The satellite holding includes more focused investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. This portion is used to generate higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. It may involve experiments or high-conviction stocks that are tracked and reviewed periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. The satellite portfolio is typically more volatile; while some stocks may fall significantly, others might triple in value over short periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

## Personal Application

One investor applies this method by allocating approximately 80% of their portfolio to the core and the remaining 20% to the satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. Their personal experience with this structure has been beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

[[basics_of_small_cap_investing | Small cap investing]] has gained significant popularity among investors over the last three to five years, moving away from the traditional "blue chip syndrome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Grow Mutual Fund is introducing a Nifty Small Cap 250 Index Fund AFO, with subscriptions open from February 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Namrita, an educator at Grow Mutual Fund, provides insights into this investment category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## What are Small Caps?
Companies are generally classified into large, mid, and small caps based on their market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Large Caps**: The top 100 companies by market capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Mid Caps**: Companies ranked 101 to 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Small Caps**: Companies ranked 251 to 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The Nifty Small Cap 250 Index comprises these 250 small cap stocks, spread across 21 to 22 sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Benefits of Investing in Small Cap Stocks
Small caps are generally perceived as high-risk stocks, but they also offer the potential for significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **High Growth Potential**: Historically, small cap stocks have demonstrated very good earnings growth compared to mid and large cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Many stocks that have given 10x returns over the last 10 years are likely to be in the [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | small cap category]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Including small caps can bring diversity to a portfolio, which helps in reducing overall risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Investing in a diversified basket like a small cap index fund ensures exposure to the entire small cap universe, potentially capturing high-performing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Risks of Investing in Small Cap Stocks
While offering high growth potential, the small cap category is also considered high-risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **High Volatility**: Small cap stocks tend to be very volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Stock Selection Challenge**: Selecting the "right" small cap stock is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Choosing the wrong stock can lead to substantial losses, with some resulting in 0x returns compared to potential 100x returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Higher Negative Returns**: Over the last five years, small caps have shown the highest percentage of stocks with negative returns compared to mid and large caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Overvaluation Concerns**: There are discussions that [[risks_and_rewards_of_investing_in_sme_ipos | small caps are overvalued]] in the current market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Mitigating Risk: The Role of Diversification and Index Funds
Due to the high-risk nature of small caps, diversification is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. If an individual investor selects a single small cap stock incorrectly, the downside risk is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Ways to Invest in Small Caps
There are three main ways for investors to gain exposure to small caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>:

1.  **Directly Buying Small Cap Stocks**: This involves directly purchasing individual small cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The challenge here is the high volatility and difficulty in selecting the appropriate stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
2.  **Actively Managed Small Cap Funds**: Investors can opt for actively managed small cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Currently, there are 24 such funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. However, each fund manager has a different investment philosophy, leading to varied returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. There's no guarantee that a top-performing active fund will continue to excel in the future, making financial advisor consultation advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
3.  **[[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | Small Cap Index Funds]]**: This approach involves investing in the entire universe of small caps by mirroring a small cap index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. A small cap index fund holds the same 250 stocks as the Nifty Small Cap 250 index, with the exact same weightage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This provides crucial diversification across numerous sectors, mitigating the risk associated with individual stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Historical Performance and Valuation
When assessing the [[historical_performance_and_valuation_of_small_cap_index | performance of small caps]], it's essential to look at long-term returns due to their risky nature and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **10-Year Returns**: The Nifty Small Cap 250 Index has delivered a CAGR of 18.9% over 10 years, significantly outperforming the Nifty 50 Index which gave around 12.96% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Wealth Creation**: A monthly SIP of ₹15,200 in a small cap index fund could potentially grow to ₹1 crore in 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Valuation (PE Ratio)
Valuation helps investors determine if a stock is overpriced, underpriced, or fairly priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. A common parameter used for valuation is the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio, calculated by dividing the stock price by its earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **PE Ratio Interpretation**: The PE ratio indicates how much an investor is willing to pay for every unit of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. A lower PE ratio is generally considered better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Current Valuation**: The PE ratio of the Nifty Small Cap 250 Index is approximately 25.62 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This suggests that the index is currently undervalued compared to actively managed funds and is lower than its five-year average, indicating it is favorably priced for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Grow Nifty Small Cap 250 Index Fund
The primary objective of an index fund is to replicate or mirror its underlying index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Tracking Error**: The main challenge is achieving exact replication due to "tracking error," which measures how closely the fund mirrors the index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. A lower tracking error indicates better replication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Grow's Technology**: Grow Mutual Fund has developed an in-house technology called "Spear" to reduce tracking error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This technology enables more frequent rebalancing of the fund's portfolio, ensuring it matches the index to a large extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Who Should Consider Investing?
Investing in a small cap index fund is suitable for specific investor profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>:
*   **High-Risk Appetite**: Investors should have a high tolerance for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. If one's risk appetite or ability is not high, this fund may not be suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Investment Horizon**: A reasonably long investment horizon is necessary for this fund category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Seeking Diversified Small Cap Exposure**: It's ideal for investors who want exposure to small cap stocks or funds but are unsure about selecting individual stocks or actively managed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. An index fund simplifies this by automatically providing exposure to the entire small cap universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

Always remember to conduct your own research and consult a financial advisor before making any financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

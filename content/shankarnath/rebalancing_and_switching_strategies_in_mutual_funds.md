A common question in investment webinars asks which two funds one would choose for a simplified portfolio, encompassing various categories, capitalizations, and investing styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. After reviewing parameters like returns, volatility, drawdowns, and existing research, a combination of a momentum fund and a value fund emerged as the most comfortable choice for a two-fund portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Why Momentum and Value?

Both momentum and value investing strategies are rooted in market anomalies, which occur when investors over or under-react to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. While these strategies do not always work, they possess a unique characteristic: they appear to be negatively correlated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This negative correlation is uncommon in equities and can help achieve objectives related to returns, [[asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation]], and risk management within a two-fund portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

*   **Momentum Investing**: This strategy is based on the tendency for investments that have performed relatively well to continue performing well for some time, and similarly, for poorly performing investments to continue their trend, at least in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It can seem counterintuitive to the conventional "buy low, sell high" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The investor profile for momentum typically focuses on short-term price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Value Investing**: This approach identifies a gap between an investment's current price and its true worth, picking assets priced significantly lower than their real value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Value investors typically focus on research and the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

A study examining data from 2006 onwards used the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index and the Nifty 500 Value 50 index as representative benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Over 17 years, both indices performed well independently, with momentum generally leading in lump sum, SIP performance, and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Research suggests that a combination of momentum and value can yield even better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Portfolio Combinations and Rebalancing

### Basic 50/50 Combination
An initial portfolio allocation involves placing 50% of capital into a momentum index fund and the remaining 50% into a value index fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Over a 17-year period, this simple combination yielded a respectable 16.2% CAGR, outperforming more popular indices like the Nifty 50, Midcap 150, and Microcap 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Incorporating [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | Rebalancing]]
To potentially enhance returns, [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | rebalancing]] can be applied:
*   **Annual [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | Rebalancing]]**: Applying annual [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | rebalancing]] to the 50/50 combination resulted in a slight improvement of 0.2% in returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Six-Month [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | Rebalancing]]**: Further improved the combination's CAGR to 16.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Due to potentially higher short-term capital gains taxes, the post-tax returns for no [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | rebalancing]], annual [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | rebalancing]], and six-month [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | rebalancing]] options would likely equalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Historical data on a rolling return basis suggests this strategy can offer 15-16% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

The strength of this two-fund portfolio lies in its strong performance and an inbuilt [[asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation]] with two investing strategies that are at opposite ends of the spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Yearly performance data for momentum and value indices clearly shows they are not cut from the same cloth, with performance differences of at least 15% in many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Switching Strategies

Beyond simple rebalancing, actively managing the "up and down movement" of these factors can potentially yield extra returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Momentum-Based [[switch_strategy_in_index_funds | Switch Strategy]]
This method involves switching between momentum and value funds based on the performance of the momentum index itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. For example, if the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index rises by 20% over a three-month period, it indicates positive momentum, prompting a full investment into the momentum index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Conversely, a 20% drop would trigger a switch to the value strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Over a 17-year period, this strategy resulted in only four switches, occurring in March 2008, May 2009, March 2020, and April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This momentum-based [[switch_strategy_in_index_funds | switching strategy]] delivered a 17-year CAGR of 22.2%, a significant 6% higher than the 50/50 combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### P-Ratio Based [[switch_strategy_in_index_funds | Switching Method]]
An alternative approach uses the Nifty 50 P-ratio as a trigger for switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   If the Nifty 50 P-ratio falls below 18, the strategy switches to a momentum-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   When the ratio crosses 24, it shifts towards a value-oriented strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

This method, while respectable, yielded a 17-year CAGR of 15.1%, which was lower than the momentum-based switching strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Conclusion
A portfolio comprising a momentum fund and a value fund is well-suited for a two-fund portfolio due to their high performance in isolation and weak negative correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This combination inherently incorporates an [[asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation]] element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Additionally, investors can improve portfolio performance without increasing volatility by employing [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | rebalancing]] and strategic [[switch_strategy_in_index_funds | switching methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

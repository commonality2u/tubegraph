The [[public_provident_fund_scheme_history_and_popularity | Public Provident Fund scheme]] was introduced in 1968 and has since seen over 25 crore PPF accounts opened, holding a balance of approximately 14 lakh crore rupees [00:00:00]. It remains highly popular due to its tax-free status, guaranteed returns, and long-term investment horizon [00:00:10].

## Eligibility and Account Types

A PPF account can be opened by any Indian citizen, regardless of age [00:01:52]. An individual can open an account in their own name, or on behalf of a minor or a person of unsound mind if they are the legal guardian [00:01:57].

However, certain restrictions apply:
*   Joint PPF accounts are not permitted under current rules [00:02:04].
*   Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) cannot open a PPF account [00:02:11].
*   Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are not allowed to open new PPF accounts [00:02:11, 00:02:21]. This prohibition has been in effect since a Reserve Bank of India notification in 2003 [00:02:26]. Existing PPF accounts held by NRIs can continue to be invested in only until their 15-year maturity or subsequent 5-year extension [00:02:32]. The government's focus for the scheme remains on encouraging small savings among Indian residents [00:02:46].

### One Account Rule
An individual is allowed to open only one PPF account in their name [00:03:44, 00:03:46]. If a subscriber accidentally opens more than one account, the additional account will be deemed irregular and will not accrue any [[interest rates and maturity options for PPF | interest]] or [[triple_e_tax_benefits_of_ppf | tax benefits]] [00:03:52]. It is advisable for subscribers to amalgamate these accounts into a single one by obtaining approval from the Ministry of Finance [00:04:01].

## Opening a PPF Account

PPF accounts can be opened at any time during the year [00:02:53].
*   **Locations**: Accounts can be opened at any post office, select branches of nationalized banks, and some private banks [00:02:57].
*   **Offline Process**:
    1.  Visit an authorized bank or post office [00:03:04].
    2.  Complete the PPF account opening form [00:03:10].
    3.  Submit a copy of your PAN and Aadhar [00:03:12].
    4.  Make an initial deposit of at least 400 rupees [00:03:15].
    5.  Collect the passbook, which will contain account details [00:03:19].
*   **Online Process**: The entire process can be completed digitally, with the use of Aadhar making it fast and easy [00:03:25].

### Account Transferability
PPF accounts can be transferred from one post office to another, from one bank to another, and even between a post office and a bank (and vice versa) [00:03:34].

## Contribution Rules

### Minimum and Maximum Contributions
*   **Minimum Contribution**: A minimum contribution of 500 rupees per financial year is required [00:04:10].
*   **Maximum Contribution**: A maximum contribution of 150,000 rupees per financial year is allowed [00:04:12]. This maximum limit is subject to revision by the government periodically; for example, it was previously 70,000 rupees [00:04:24].
*   **Deposit Frequency**: Deposits can be made at any time of the year, with a maximum of 12 contributions allowed annually [00:04:18].

### Consequences of Non-Compliance
*   **Excess Deposit**: If more than 150,000 rupees is invested, the excess amount is considered irregular and will be refunded to the subscriber without any [[interest rates and maturity options for PPF | interest]] [00:04:37].
*   **Missing Minimum Contribution**: If the minimum 500 rupees contribution is missed, the PPF account will be flagged as inactive [00:04:46]. To revive it, a penalty of 50 rupees per inactive year must be paid, in addition to the outstanding minimum contribution of 500 rupees [00:04:54]. Despite being inactive, the account will continue to receive [[interest rates and maturity options for PPF | interest]] on its balance at the prevailing rates [00:05:03].

### Interest Calculation Tip
To maximize [[interest rates and maturity options for PPF | interest]] earnings, it is advisable to deposit contributions by the 5th of every month [00:11:22]. This is because the [[interest rates and maturity options for PPF | interest]] on the PPF balance is calculated monthly based on the lowest balance between the 5th and the end of the month [00:11:03]. Deposits made on the 6th or later will not earn [[interest rates and maturity options for PPF | interest]] for that specific month [00:11:15].

## Minor's Account Contribution Rules

When a parent opens a PPF account on behalf of a minor, only one such account can be opened per minor [00:08:58, 00:09:07]. The maximum aggregate contribution limit of 150,000 rupees per financial year applies to the combined contributions made to both the parent's and the minor's PPF accounts [00:09:10, 00:09:24]. For instance, a parent cannot deposit 1.5 lakh in their own account and another 1.5 lakh in the minor's account; the total for both combined cannot exceed 1.5 lakh [00:09:16].

Grandparents are generally not permitted to open a PPF account for their grandchildren [00:09:31, 00:09:35]. An exception exists if both parents have passed away and the grandparent has been appointed as the minor's legal guardian, in which case they may open an account on the minor's behalf [00:09:42].

The selection of a two-fund portfolio, especially when faced with various categories, capitalizations, and [[comparison_of_momentum_and_other_investment_styles | investing styles]], presents a significant challenge for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. After examining parameters like returns, volatility, drawdowns, and existing research, a surprising conclusion emerged: the most comfortable two-fund portfolio would consist of a [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum fund]] and a [[momentum_and_value_investing | value fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Understanding Momentum Investing

Momentum, in financial terms, is the tendency for investments that have performed relatively well to continue performing well for some time, and conversely, for poorly performing investments to continue their poor performance, at least in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This concept suggests persistence in performance, similar to how a cricketer "on fire" is expected to continue scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Understanding Value Investing

Value investing, on the other hand, is built on the conventional belief that investments should be bought low and sold high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It involves identifying investments that are priced significantly lower than their real value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The "value factor" identifies this gap between the current price and the true worth of an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Market Anomalies and Investor Profiles

Both [[momentum_and_value_investing | momentum and value investing]] strategies are based on market anomalies, which occur when investors either over- or under-react to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. While neither strategy works all the time, they cater to different investor profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. A value investor focuses on research and the long term, whereas a [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum investor]] monitors short-term price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## The Power of Negative Correlation

A significant characteristic that makes the combination of [[momentum_and_value_investing | momentum and value]] particularly appealing is their negative correlation in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This unique attribute is rare in the equity market and can help achieve portfolio objectives such as returns, asset allocation, and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## [[performance_analysis_of_momentum_vs_value_funds | Performance Analysis of Momentum vs. Value Funds]]

A study using data from 2006 onwards, focusing on the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index and the Nifty 500 Value 50 index, revealed interesting insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

*   **Individual Performance**: Both the momentum index and the value index performed well independently over 17 years, with the [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum strategy]] leading in lump sum and SIP performance, as well as in terms of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Combined 50/50 Portfolio**: A portfolio equally split between the [[momentum_and_value_investing | momentum and value indices]] yielded a respectable 17-year CAGR of 16.2% without rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This return was significantly higher than more popular indices like the Nifty 50, Nifty Midcap 150, and even the Nifty Microcap 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Impact of Rebalancing**:
    *   Annual rebalancing of the 50/50 combination slightly improved returns by 0.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   Six-month rebalancing further improved the CAGR to 16.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   However, post-tax returns for all rebalancing frequencies (without, annual, six-month) were estimated to be similar due to higher short-term capital gains tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Rolling Returns**: Historically, this 50/50 strategy showed indications of offering 15% to 16% per annum on a rolling return basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Inbuilt Asset Allocation and Risk Management

The combination of two [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investing strategies]] that are at opposite ends of the spectrum provides an inbuilt asset allocation within the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The yearly performance data clearly shows that the momentum and value indices are not "cut from the same cloth," often exhibiting performance differences of at least 15% in various years (e.g., 2006, 2009-2011, 2013-2016, 2018-2019, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## [[advanced_momentum_strategies_and_techniques | Advanced Momentum Strategies and Techniques]]: Switching Methods

To potentially enhance returns by leveraging the cyclical up and down movements of these factors, several [[advanced_momentum_strategies and techniques | advanced strategies]] were explored.

### Momentum-Based Switch Method

This method, designed for the study, operates similarly to price momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. If the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index rises by 20% over a three-month period, it indicates positive market momentum, prompting a full investment into the [[construction_of_a_momentum_stocks_portfolio | momentum index]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Conversely, a 20% drop would trigger a switch to the [[momentum_and_value_investing | value strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Over a 17-year period, this strategy required only four switches and resulted in a 17-year CAGR of 22.2%, a significant 6% higher than the 50/50 combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### P-Ratio Based Switching Method

This alternative approach used Nifty 50 P/E ratio bands to trigger switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   If the Nifty 50 P/E ratio fell below 18, the strategy would switch to momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   If the ratio crossed 24, it would become more value-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
This method yielded a 17-year CAGR of 15.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Ideal Two-Fund Portfolio

A combination of [[momentum_and_value_index_strategy | momentum and value]] is considered perfectly suited for a two-fund portfolio due to several key reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>:
1.  **High Performance in Isolation**: Both factors perform well on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
2.  **Weak Negative Correlation**: Their weak negative correlation adds an essential asset allocation element to the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
3.  **Performance Improvement Without Added Volatility**: Investors can enhance portfolio performance without increasing volatility through strategic approaches like the switching methods discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### Further Exploration

For those interested in sharpening their investment edge, a short course on quantitative [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investing strategy]] is available. This course focuses on building foundational skills in backtesting logic, screening, and analyzing financial data, including a rule-based [[methodology_for_identifying_undervalued_and_high_momentum_stocks | investing strategy]] for stock picking, entry, exit, and sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Further exploration into different combinations of [[momentum_and_value_investing | momentum and value]], incorporating variables like P/E ratios, volume, and moving averages, can lead to developing even more superior models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

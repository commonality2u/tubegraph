Multicap funds are a category of mutual fund schemes designed to simplify investment tasks for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. They are a favored category within mutual funds due to their construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Evolution of Multicap Funds

Initially, "flexicap" schemes allowed fund managers to allocate any proportion of assets across large, mid, and small-cap buckets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. While this offered flexibility, it meant there wasn't a single mutual fund category that could help an investor build a truly diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

To address this, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated the creation of a separate [[SEBI regulations on multicap funds | multicap funds category]] in September 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Under these regulations, every multicap scheme must invest at least 25% of its assets in large caps, 25% or more in midcaps, and 25% or more in small caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Benefits of Multicap Funds
While seemingly restrictive, the SEBI mandate still allows fund managers flexibility in their overall allocation (e.g., 50:25:25, 40:30:30, or 33:33:33) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A key advantage is that fund managers can pick specific stocks within all three market cap segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, ensuring investments are made in "the most ideal companies within each of the three buckets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Multicap funds provide good control over allocations, navigate the dynamic nature of the [[Performance Analysis in Indian Stock Market | Indian stock market]], and have shown strong [[Performance comparison with market indices | performance and volatility]] management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Benchmarking Multicap Performance

For most multicap schemes, including the Grow Multicap Fund, the primary benchmark is either the Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index or the Nifty 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index is considered the most suitable benchmark as it aligns closely with how a multicap fund is designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, unlike the Nifty 500 which is predominantly large-cap oriented with minimal small-cap exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## [[Performance Analysis of Indian Index Funds | Performance Analysis]]

Historically, the multicap index has demonstrated superior [[Performance comparison with market indices | performance]] compared to both the Nifty 500 and Nifty 50 across many years on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

*   **Alpha Generation**: When calculating on an SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) basis, there has historically been an alpha of 1.5% to 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Rolling Returns**: The average and median rolling returns have consistently stayed around 13%, which is about 1% to 1.5% higher than the Nifty 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Consistency**: While there might be some scattering in 3-year and 5-year rolling return data, longer periods of 7, 10, and 15 years show a very strong probability of achieving returns in the 12% to 16% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This makes them attractive for conservative long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Volatility and Discipline

In terms of annual [[Performance comparison with market indices | performance]], the Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25 index often ranks in a "middling second rank, third rank" position among various indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This indicates that investing through multicaps promotes a more disciplined approach to investing and helps manage volatility effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Investment Considerations

Multicap funds are actively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. It is generally suggested to maintain an investment horizon of at least 5 years for multicap funds or any equity fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. As pure equity schemes, they are labeled as very high risk in the product riskometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Investors should ensure that any investment fits well with their overall portfolio construct and consider consulting a financial advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

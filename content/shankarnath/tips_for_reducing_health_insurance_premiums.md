When choosing a [[steps_to_choosing_a_health_insurance_plan|health insurance plan]], the premium is a final element to consider, coming after narrowing down options based on core coverage, exclusions, and cashless services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. While health insurance premiums in India are not considered expensive compared to other parts of the world, there are several ways to potentially reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## Factors Affecting Premiums

Several factors directly influence the cost of your health insurance premium:
*   **Age** The older you are, the higher the premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **[[specific_issues_related_to_term_insurance_for_smokers_and_preexisting_conditions|Pre-existing Illness]]** If you have a [[specific_issues_related_to_term_insurance_for_smokers_and_preexisting_conditions|pre-existing illness]], you will likely pay more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Sum Insured** A higher sum insured results in a higher premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **[[understanding_health_insurance_exclusions_and_waiting_periods|Waiting Period]]** Opting for a shorter [[understanding_health_insurance_exclusions_and_waiting_periods|waiting period]] typically means a higher premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Specific Benefits** Features like maternity, OPD (Out-Patient Department), and international coverage are generally more expensive and add to the policy premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

It is important to first identify your "must-have" requirements for a plan, as the more benefits you seek, the more you will pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Strategies for Reducing Premiums

Once you have a shortlist of health insurance plans that meet your essential needs, you can compare premiums and consider additional features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Here are several ways to potentially reduce your premium:

*   **Opt for a Higher PD Cover (if no [[specific_issues_related_to_term_insurance_for_smokers_and_preexisting_conditions|Pre-existing Disease]])** If you do not have a [[specific_issues_related_to_term_insurance_for_smokers_and_preexisting_conditions|pre-existing disease]], choosing a higher PD (Pre-existing Disease) cover can save you approximately four to five percent on the premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Choose [[understanding_health_insurance_exclusions_and_waiting_periods|Co-payment]]** Opting for [[understanding_health_insurance_exclusions_and_waiting_periods|co-payment]], where you pay a share of the claim, can reduce premiums by eight to twelve percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Non-Smoker Discounts** Some plans offer a five to ten percent discount for non-smokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Multi-Year Payments** Paying for multiple years (two or even three years) upfront can lead to a discount on the premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Healthy Lifestyle Renewal Discount** Some insurers offer renewal discounts if you maintain a healthy lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Other Discounts** Discounts may also be available based on your credit score, the city you live in, or as loyalty discounts for existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Always verify available discounts with the insurance company or an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

Ultimately, the premium should be considered after you have absolute clarity on the fitment benefits, exclusions, claim process, and cashless service of a [[steps_to_choosing_a_health_insurance_plan|health insurance policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

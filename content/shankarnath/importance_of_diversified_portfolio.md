A [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_stock_market_investing | diversified portfolio]] is a fundamental pillar of investing firmly advocated by investors like Porinju Veliyath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Benefits
A diversified portfolio helps to reduce investment risk without significantly altering potential portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Application in Investing
Porinju Veliyath, for example, supports [[benefits_of_asset_allocation_in_diversifying_investments | diversification]] by allocating some money to large-cap blue-chip companies, even though this is not his primary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He is also not known to have a preference for any particular sector or type of company or stock, contributing to [[strategies_for_diversifying_bond_investment_risk | diversification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Consequences of Lack of Diversification
In 2018, Porinju Veliyath experienced significant losses due to "highly concentrated bets in not so proven companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This period served as a learning experience, leading him to avoid very small and illiquid companies in his portfolio management service (PMS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. His current portfolio now includes larger businesses like Tata Communications, Raymond, and Hindware, which constitute 50% of his holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

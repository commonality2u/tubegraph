The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used [[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | valuation metric]] in stock analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. It is calculated by dividing the present share price by the past 12 months' earnings per share (EPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. However, this traditional calculation has a limitation: it uses past performance to gauge future returns, which may not be logical as future earnings truly determine investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

## Understanding PE of One

A visible PE ratio of one means a company's share price is equal to or less than its earnings per share over the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. While thousands of companies might have PE ratios of 20, 30, or 50, a PE of 1 is a rare phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. From a list of over 4000 companies on the Indian Stock Exchange, only about 17 companies might have a visible PE of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

### Hidden PE of One

Investor Mohnish Pabrai refers to a "[[identifying_hidden_pe_of_one_companies | hidden PE of one]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This concept applies to companies that currently have a high PE ratio, but whose future earnings per share are highly probable to be significantly higher than their current price per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. If a portfolio contains stocks with a PE of one, "generally good things will happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Key Factors for Identifying Hidden PE of One Companies

Four primary factors influence a company's ability to reach a [[identifying_hidden_pe_of_one_companies | hidden PE of one]]:

1.  **Profit Growth**: This is the most crucial variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Companies with profit growth exceeding 20% are more likely to achieve a hidden PE of one, even if their current PE ratio is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. For example, Avenue Supermarts (DMart), Warrant Beverages, and IRCTC have demonstrated this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. DMart, despite a PE of 112, has grown earnings by an average of 25% annually, suggesting it could reach a PE of 1 in 11 years if this growth continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
2.  **Starting PE Ratio**: A lower initial PE ratio vastly improves a company's chances of reaching a PE of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. A company with a PE of 10 that is growing at 10% per annum will reach a PE of 1 faster than a company with a PE of 100 growing at 20% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Time Horizon**: Ideally, investors should seek companies that have a "1PE visibility" within a maximum of five to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Longer timeframes (multi-decade plans) are less appealing due to potential disruptions like competition, changes in consumer demand, technological advancements, natural calamities, or regulatory changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
4.  **Company Size**: [[identifying_hidden_pe_of_one_companies | Hidden PE of one]] opportunities might be more prevalent in mid-cap and small-cap companies compared to large-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

While using stock screeners is an initial step, simply filtering by PE ratio and earnings growth can lead to lists dominated by companies with high debt, unstable operating margins, or corporate governance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Alibaba Group Holdings Limited

Alibaba, a Chinese company, presents an example of a potential [[identifying_hidden_pe_of_one_companies | hidden PE of one]] opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Despite an 80% market valuation drop due to geopolitics, regulatory changes, and China's COVID policy, the company remains highly profitable and trades at low valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

*   **Cash-Adjusted Price**: At the time of recording, Alibaba traded at $65 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. With a net cash position of $70 billion ($10 per share), its cash-adjusted price is $55 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Projected Earnings**: The consensus EPS for FY23 was $7.11, resulting in a cash-adjusted PE of 7.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Projections suggested an EPS of $14.29 per share in five years, reducing the PE to 3.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Earnings (Free Cash Flow)**: Beyond accounting earnings (EPS), economic earnings represented by free cash flow (FCF) offer a deeper insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Alibaba's FCF numbers have consistently averaged 40% higher than its EPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
*   **Reconstructed Hidden PE**: By applying the FCF difference, the projected FY28 EPS of $14.29 can be "reconstructed" as a hidden EPS of $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This brings Alibaba's [[identifying_hidden_pe_of_one_companies | hidden PE]] to just 2.75 on a cash-adjusted basis ($55/$20), much closer to the PE of one target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

## Practical Advice

*   **Infrequent Occurrence**: A PE of one is a rare phenomenon; finding such companies might happen only once every three or four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Cyclical Businesses**: Cyclical businesses should be approached with caution as their PE ratios are volatile, and visibility beyond one or two years is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Their prices are driven more by demand-supply gaps than earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Parameters**: When searching for PE of one stocks, prioritize direct parameters like sales growth, profit growth, operating margins, and pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Consider Turnaround Companies**: Companies that were once strong but are now facing difficulties, yet could recover with capital infusion and good management, might fit the [[identifying_hidden_pe_of_one_companies | hidden PE of one]] criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.
*   **Look Beyond Screeners**: Investors should learn to look beyond standard stock screeners to find businesses that can achieve a future PE of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

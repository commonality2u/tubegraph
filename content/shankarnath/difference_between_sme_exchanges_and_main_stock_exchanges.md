The Indian stock market comprises several indices, including the Nifty, Sensex, and BSE 500, which represent a diversified set of companies. These main board indices typically deliver a return of around 12 to 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. In contrast, Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) stocks have shown significantly higher returns. The [[sme_ipo_index_performance | SME IPO Index performance]] delivered a return of 126% over the last year and converted one rupee into twenty rupees over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. For instance, Krishka Strapping Solutions, an SME, saw a 400% gain and was oversubscribed 337 times at the time of its issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This boosted interest has led to a surge in SME IPOs, from just 27 in 2020 to 109 in 2022, with almost 200 new listings expected in the current financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Role of SMEs in the Economy

SMEs are the backbone of the economy, with 64 million ultra-small corporates in a country, 25,000 of which have revenues between 50 and 200 crore rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Globally, SMEs run 50% to 60% of the world's businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. In India, micro, small, and medium enterprises contribute 40% of exports and 30% of the country's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Challenges Faced by SMEs

Historically, a major challenge for SMEs has been [[challenges_faced_by_smes_in_accessing_capital | limited access to capital]] and untimely credit availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Their primary funding sources were internal approvals (reinvesting operational earnings), borrowing from friends and relatives, or traditional banks, which were often inefficient in underwriting smaller, riskier businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Access to capital markets was missing, depriving SMEs of a stable revenue source and making it difficult for external investors to exit a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Furthermore, big fundraisers and top investment banking firms were less interested in working with SMEs because they typically seek to raise smaller amounts (20-50 crore rupees) compared to the 500 crore rupees or more sought by mid- or large-sized companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Formation of SME Exchanges

To address these capital-related problems, the Indian government took an active interest, leading to the formation of dedicated SME exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This concept was floated in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, resulting in the National Stock Exchange establishing NSE Emerge and the Bombay Stock Exchange launching BSE SME exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Consequently, both the NSE and BSE now operate two different boards: the main board (for large companies like Reliance, HDFC Bank, TCS) and the SME board (for listed SME stocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The SME exchanges have found their footing in the last 2-3 years, with over 100 IPOs in the current year and more than 2,500 crore rupees raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Key Differences: Main Board vs. SME Exchanges

The differences between the main board and SME exchanges are significant, particularly in their listing criteria, operational guidelines, and investor experience.

### Listing Criteria and Regulatory Relaxations
*   **Lax Stringency**: Listing criteria for SMEs are considerably less stringent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Regulators have allowed relaxations in terms of net tangible assets, net worth, track record of distributable profits, and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Minimum Capital**: Companies with a minimum post-issue capital of just 1 crore rupees (up to 25 crores) can be listed on the SME exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Allottees**: A minimum of 50 allottees is sufficient, with the promoter holding 20% of the equity post-issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Profit Track Record**: Unlike main board IPOs, SMEs may be exempted from the condition of having a certain profit track record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Prospectus Vetting**: The IPO prospectus of an SME is vetted by the respective exchange (NSE or BSE), not by [[sebis_role_in_the_stock_market | SEBI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Financial Reporting**: Financial results for SMEs need to be submitted on a half-yearly basis, unlike quarterly for main board companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Investment and Trading Differences
*   **Minimum Application/Trading Amount**: The minimum application amount and trading lot for an SME IPO cannot be less than 1 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This is a significant disadvantage for retail investors, as main board IPOs can be applied for with as little as 15,000-20,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Lot Size Trading**: On SME exchanges, shares must be bought or sold in lots, whereas on the main board, trading can occur with even one share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For example, buying shares in BEW Engineering Limited would require spending around 3.6 lakh rupees due to its lot size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Use of Funds**: While big corporate IPOs often use a large portion of funds to provide an exit to existing shareholders (VCs, strategic investors, promoters), a significant chunk of the capital raised by SMEs (20-50 crore rupees) goes directly into growth capital to increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Risks and Liquidity
*   **Liquidity Concerns**: A common concern in [[risks_and_rewards_of_investing_in_sme_ipos | SME investing]] is liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Without derivatives (futures and options), investors are primarily those seeking listing day gains or those intending to stay invested for a minimum of 3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Migration to Main Board**: A key aspect for SME investors is the potential for the stock to migrate to the main board after being listed on an SME platform for at least 3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This migration attracts more interest from institutional investors, increasing liquidity and offering an exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Over one-third of the companies listed on BSE SME index (442 companies) and NSE Emerge (333 companies) have already migrated to the main board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Safety and Risk**: SMEs are inherently fragile, and it is not uncommon for many SME IPOs to trade 80-95% below their issue price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The relaxed compliances, six-monthly financial reporting, and high investment threshold contribute to the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. For example, none of the six SME IPOs from FY 2012 had made it to the main board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Returns and Investing Strategies

Despite the risks, the S&P BSE SME IPO Index has shown impressive returns: a three-year CAGR of 193%, a five-year CAGR of 82%, and a ten-year annualized return of 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. An investment of 1 lakh rupees in this index in 2013 would have swelled to over 1 crore rupees today, representing a 100x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Selecting SME Stocks

[[investing_strategies_in_sme_stocks | Investing strategies in SME stocks]] require careful selection, given their volatility and the limited available information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Key filters for choosing the right companies include:

1.  **Significant Player/Monopoly**: Identify SMEs that are significant players in their industry, especially if large corporates depend on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This indicates a [[understanding_monopolies_in_stock_markets | monopoly]] type situation, such as BEW Engineering Limited, which holds a strong position in manufacturing processed equipment for pharmaceutical and chemical industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
2.  **Addressable Market**: The company should operate in an addressable market with a long growth runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Look for a "small fish in a large pond" with limited competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
3.  **Financials**: Assess three major metrics:
    *   Consistently increasing sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
    *   Operational cash flow in line with profits, indicating the company is being paid for its efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
    *   Low or no debt, and comfortable debt servicing ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
4.  **Promoter Quality**: This is considered the most crucial factor, with some experts assigning it 60% weightage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Evaluate the promoter's past history for fraudulent practices, project completion rate (quality, cost, time), execution skills, and documented plans for business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This requires extensive reading beyond the red herring prospectus and potentially meeting the promoter and CFO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Investing in SME IPOs

Applying for an SME IPO or buying and selling listed shares is as simple as logging onto a trading account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Most brokerage platforms provide lists of ongoing and upcoming IPOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

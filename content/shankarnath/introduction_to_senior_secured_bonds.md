## Overview for Retail Investors

Traditionally, options for [[Fixed deposit schemes for senior citizens | fixed income]] investments for retail investors have been limited, primarily including fixed deposits, corporate bonds, and [[Understanding Debt Mutual Funds and Bond Investments | debt mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These typically offer yields ranging from 6% to a maximum of 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Historically, long-term investors benefited from indexation benefits on capital gains, which allowed for decent post-tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, with the removal of indexation benefits for debt investors, there has been a search for alternatives offering higher pre-tax yields (10-12%) within an acceptable risk level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This search led to the exploration of [[senior_secured_bonds | senior secured bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## What is a Bond?

A bond is essentially a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. When an investor subscribes to a company's bond, they effectively become a lender to that company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Bonds can be primarily classified as either secured or unsecured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Secured Bonds

[[Risk management and benefits of secured bonds | Secured bonds]] are backed by specific collateral pledged by the issuer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This collateral can be a tangible asset like property, equipment, inventory, or receivables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, or it can be based on future revenues such as toll collections, airport fees, or subscription money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The collateral provides an extra layer of security, ensuring that in the event of liquidation (bankruptcy), the collateral can be sold to repay the bondholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Seniority in Repayment Hierarchy

The term "senior" refers to the repayment hierarchy when a company faces bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. In a liquidation scenario, various stakeholders line up for their dues, but not all have equal rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The repayment order typically is:
1.  Government dues (central or state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
2.  Secured lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
3.  Unpaid employee salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
4.  Unsecured creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
5.  Equity shareholders (usually little to nothing left) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>

Within secured lenders, [[senior_secured_bonds | senior bondholders]] receive a higher priority, meaning their claims are settled first, offering an added layer of protection and a higher chance of recovering their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Senior Secured Bonds: Combining Security and Seniority

Unlike an unsecured bond, which relies solely on the issuer's promise to pay, a [[senior_secured_bonds | senior secured bond]] offers two additional layers of protection in the event of a default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>:
1.  **Collateral backing**: As explained, tangible assets or future revenues secure the bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
2.  **Higher priority in liquidation**: [[senior_secured_bonds | Senior bondholders]] are paid before other creditors and even other secured lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

This combination significantly helps in reducing the bondholder's potential loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Yields and Credit Ratings

Despite carrying a lower risk compared to unsecured bonds, [[senior_secured_bonds | senior secured bonds]] can offer attractive yields, currently ranging from 11% to 12% over short tenures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

A common misconception is that credit ratings are assigned to individual bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, these ratings are assigned to the issuer of the bonds, meaning the rating remains the same for both secured and unsecured instruments issued by the same company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:05:04]</a>. Thus, while a company might have a 'double B' rating, its [[senior_secured_bonds | senior secured bond]] can behave more like a lower-risk 'A-rated' instrument in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This distinction, not explicitly reflected in official ratings, represents a "reward-risk arbitrage" for platforms with deeper understanding of risk, assets, collateral, and liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Online Bond Platforms (OBPs)

Online bond platforms have emerged to make high-yielding [[investment_in_government_bonds_for_retirees | fixed income]] options, previously accessible only to High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs), available to retail investors at a much smaller ticket size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. HNIs traditionally have access to various options like Category 2 AIFs (10% returns), performing credit funds (13-15%), venture debt (16-17%), and special situation debt (20-22%), requiring minimum investments of lakhs or crores of rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:07:28]</a>. Retail investors face challenges due to limited awareness, lack of information, and restricted access to these instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Features of Online Bond Platforms (OBPs)

1.  **Curated Platform**: OBPs are not traditional marketplaces where any company can list bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Platforms like Wint Wealth meticulously evaluate each bond before offering it to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
2.  **Regulatory Compliance**: All OBPs are registered as stock brokers within the debt segment, making them subject to SEBI's (Securities and Exchange Board of India) regulatory framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This ensures only listed bonds can be offered, adding security through credit ratings and higher governance standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
3.  **Collateral Selection**: Platforms often cherry-pick the collateral pool. For instance, they might specifically select higher quality assets like housing loans or gold loans as collateral from an NBFC, rather than accepting random collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The goal is to maximize recovery in case of default by ensuring the collateral can be easily sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
4.  **Ticket Size**: The minimum investment amount on these platforms is typically 10,000 rupees, a significant reduction from the previous minimum of 10 lakhs as of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
5.  **Returns**: Bond yields on these platforms generally range from 10% to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. These returns depend on variables such as issuer type, creditworthiness, maturity period, whether the bond is secured or unsecured, senior or subordinate, placement type (public/private), and if it's callable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Investors are advised to understand these details and be cautious of platforms that solely focus on returns without providing comprehensive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Regulatory Evolution

Regulations for online bond platforms have evolved to keep pace with innovation and strengthen investor protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>:
*   **2022**: SEBI mandated all OBPs to register as stock brokers for greater oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **2023**: Key reforms included mandatory KYC, grievance redressal through the SCORES platform, routing of all orders through the RFQ platform of recognized stock exchanges, and a complete ban on unlisted debt securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **2024**: SEBI slashed the minimum investment in debt securities from one lakh to 10,000 rupees to encourage retail participation, making the corporate bond market more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## [[Risk management and benefits of secured bonds | Risk Management]]

Returns and risk are inherently linked in evaluating any debt instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Efforts to manage risk occur at multiple levels:

*   **Macro Level**: SEBI has established a strong operational framework through regulation, registration, and reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Product Level**: [[senior_secured_bonds | Senior secured bonds]] offer a security blanket compared to unsecured ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Platform Level**: OBPs like Wint Wealth employ a curated approach, carefully selecting issuers and scrutinizing collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Some platforms even co-invest in issues, putting their own money (e.g., 2% of issue size) to align their interests with investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Mitigating Specific Risks

While [[senior_secured_bonds | senior secured bonds]] are riskier than bank fixed deposits, various strategies can mitigate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>:

*   **Credit Risk (Issuer Default)**: Opt for bonds structured with both seniority and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate Risk (Bond Price Fall)**: This risk, often seen in [[debt_mutual_funds_and_safety_considerations | debt mutual funds]], can be avoided by holding bonds until maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Risk (Difficulty in Selling)**: While unforeseen events like COVID can impact liquidity, OBPs generally help investors liquidate bonds by finding buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Sector Exposure Risk**: Even if all issuers belong to a broad sector like NBFCs, they might be diversified into different business lines (e.g., MSME lending, unsecured personal loans, student loans, microfinance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:15:20]</a>. A key [[strategies_for_investing_in_longterm_bonds | strategy]] is diversification: instead of investing a large sum into a single bond, invest it across five, six, or even ten different [[senior_secured_bonds | senior secured bonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This mitigates the risk of losing all money during a default and improves liquidity, as it's unlikely all bonds will lack buyers simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Interest in bond investing through online platforms is growing due to increased awareness, stronger regulations, ease of online buying, and lower ticket sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. [[senior_secured_bonds | Senior secured bonds]] appeal to investors willing to take slightly more risk than fixed deposits in exchange for higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. While the author has begun investing in these bonds to test them, the allocation may increase as confidence grows with timely interest payments and capital returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. The goal is to maintain a balanced portfolio and continuously improve the risk-return profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Having more investment options, particularly those previously limited to HNIs, is beneficial for retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

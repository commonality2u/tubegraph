The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a powerful tool designed to help investors navigate market volatility by indicating when a stock might be [[when_to_buy_and_sell_stocks | overbought or oversold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Kunal, a researcher for this video, refers to RSI as the "secret keepers of market sentiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This [[technical_analysis_in_turnaround_stocks | technical indicator]] helps analyze and assess the momentum and strength of price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Origin and Core Concept of RSI

The concept of the Relative Strength Index was introduced in 1978 by J. Welles Wilder, an American mechanical engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Wilder presented RSI as a momentum oscillator that measures the velocity and magnitude of price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Essentially, RSI provides a signal indicating when a stock is overbought or oversold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The "relative strength" in RSI refers to the strength or weakness of a stock based on its own performance, without comparing it to other stocks or the overall market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Identifying Overbought and Oversold Conditions

The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The standard thresholds for identifying overbought and oversold conditions are:

*   **Overbought:** If the RSI is **above 70**, the stock is considered overbought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This can be interpreted as a signal for an investor to consider selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. An RSI of 100 indicates 14 continuous days of upward price movement, suggesting a potential price correction is near <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Oversold:** If the RSI is **below 30**, it signifies an oversold situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This can be interpreted as a buying signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. An RSI of 0 means the stock price has fallen for all 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

In addition to buy and sell signals, RSI also identifies stocks ready for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

While 30 and 70 are the most common thresholds, some experienced traders and investors may adjust these numbers to suit their [[investment_strategies_using_stock_screeners | investment style]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Similarly, while Wilder used a 14-day window for calculation, practitioners also tweak this, with 9-day and 25-day RSI gaining popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Practical Application and Examples

### Using Stock Screeners
The RSI can be effectively used with [[investment_strategies_using_stock_screeners | stock screeners]] to filter for buying opportunities, specifically stocks where RSI is less than 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. An example list of such companies included Asian Paints, HCL Tech, Mahindra, Bandhan Bank, and Vinati Organics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Asian Paints Simulation
Asian Paints demonstrated the effectiveness of RSI. The stock was in an overbought zone in late July and then reached an RSI of 21 (oversold zone) a week later, signaling a buying opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This decline was due to the stock losing 15% in value over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

A simulation over a three-year period (November 1, 2020, to October 31, 2023) involved buying 100 shares of Asian Paints when RSI went below 30 and selling when it first hit 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This strategy yielded an annualized return of 13.7%, which was 3% higher than a simple buy-and-hold strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Application on Broader Indices
The same principle can be applied to broader indices like the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. A backtesting on the Nifty 50 from 2017 to 2023 identified 28 occasions where the index entered an overbought or oversold zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Specifically, there were 22 intrusions into the overbought zone (RSI > 70) and six occasions leading to buying opportunities (RSI < 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Refining Buy/Sell Signals with Failure Swings

RSI is a lagging indicator, using historical data to generate signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. A basic approach is to buy when RSI first goes below 30 and sell when it first goes above 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. However, stocks can continue their trend even after entering these zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

To address this, Wilder introduced the concept of [[failure_swings_in_rsi | failure_swings_in_rsi | Failure Swings of RSI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This suggests:

*   **Selling:** Instead of selling immediately upon entering the overbought zone, wait and exit only when the RSI cuts the 70 mark from the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. For example, with Bajaj Auto, waiting until RSI dipped below 70 in mid-May allowed capturing an additional 12.5% price increase, even though it initially crossed the 70 RSI mark on April 6th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Buying:** Similarly, do not buy a stock immediately when it enters the oversold zone (RSI < 30). Instead, wait for the RSI to breach the 30 mark from below before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Dalmia Bharat Limited's stock continued to fall by an additional 6% after initially piercing the 30 RSI before it again breached the 30 mark from the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

This tweak of waiting for the RSI to complete its cycle improves the probability of not missing out on significant price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

The Piotroski Score, sometimes referred to as Piotroski's F-Score, is a scoring mechanism used to assess the strength and [[Piotroski Score and Financial Health Indicators | financial health]] of a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. It was developed by Joseph Piotroski, who first wrote about it in a paper in the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The formula itself is considered "ridiculously simple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> and gained prominence after Piotroski generated over 20% Return on Investment (ROI) by [[Backtesting and Evaluating Piotroski Score Effectiveness | backtesting]] data and buying stocks based on his system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## How the Piotroski Score Works

The Piotroski Score acts like a report card for a company's [[Piotroski Score and Financial Health Indicators | financial health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, scoring companies on a scale from zero to nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   A score of 7, 8, or 9 indicates the company is financially strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Scores of 0, 1, or 2 identify companies that are struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

To calculate the score, nine different criteria are used, with one point awarded for each criterion met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. These nine factors are categorized into three main areas: profitability, leverage/liquidity/source of funds, and operating efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Profitability (4 points)

Profitability has the highest weighting, contributing four out of the nine available points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

1.  **Net Income:** One point is awarded if the company has made a profit (even one rupee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Companies like Coal India, which made 20,000 crores profit, receive one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
2.  **Return on Assets (RoA):** A point is awarded if the current year's RoA is higher than the previous year's, indicating improved asset utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. For example, Coal India received a point as its RoA increased from 10.2% to 14.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. A high RoA suggests efficient use of assets to generate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
3.  **Operating Cash Flow:** A point is earned if the current year's operating cash flow is higher than the preceding year's cash flow from operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This metric reflects how well a company manages its core business activities to make money and cover expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Coal India showed improvement in this area and received one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
4.  **Accruals (Earnings Quality):** A point is awarded if the company's cash flow from operations is greater than its net income (excluding extraordinary items), signifying superior earnings quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This ensures profits are not prone to sharp fluctuations and originate from core operations rather than one-time gains or manipulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. If modified net profits are lower than cash from operations, it suggests earnings are unreliable, resulting in zero points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Coal India received zero points in 2018-2020 but started scoring points as operational cash flow increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Leverage, Liquidity, and Source of Funds (3 points)

This category focuses on the company's financial structure and ability to meet obligations.

5.  **Long-term Debt to Total Asset Ratio (Leverage):** One point is added if this ratio is lower in the current year compared to the previous year, indicating a reduction in [[Evaluating company robustness using the fragility scorecard | financial risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Coal India received a zero for this metric as its ratio increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
6.  **Current Ratio (Liquidity):** A point is awarded if the current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) has improved compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. A ratio greater than one generally indicates the company can cover its short-term financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Coal India missed a point here because its current year's ratio was lower than the preceding year's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
7.  **Issuance of New Shares (Source of Funds):** No points are given if a company issues new shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This is considered a negative factor, possibly suggesting ownership dilution, potential Earnings Per Share (EPS) reduction, or [[Piotroski Score and Financial Health Indicators | financial instability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Operating Efficiency (2 points)

These parameters assess how effectively a company manages its operations.

8.  **Gross Margin:** One point is awarded if the current year's gross margin is higher than the previous year's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Coal India scored a point for delivering its highest gross profit margin in years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
9.  **Asset Turnover Ratio:** A point is given if the current year's asset turnover ratio exceeds the previous year's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This ratio measures how well a company uses its assets to generate sales and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Coal India showed improvement in this ratio and earned an additional point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Application and Effectiveness

The F-score is a composite sum of these individual scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. For Coal India, the calculated F-score was 7, with gaps in leverage and current ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. However, it's worth noting that the Piotroski Score for the same company can vary across different platforms (e.g., Screener.in gave 9, Trendline 7, Gurufocus.com 6, and Value Research Online 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This highlights the [[variability_of_the_piotroski_score_across_different_markets | variability of the Piotroski Score across different markets]] or calculation methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

In an Indian context, an exploration of Nifty 200 companies yielded only four with a top score of nine: Coal India, Varun Beverages, PI Industries, and Oil India Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Approximately 35% of companies across market caps had an F-score of 7, 8, or 9, suggesting a good number of fundamentally strong companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

[[Backtesting and Evaluating Piotroski Score Effectiveness | Backtesting]] a portfolio of high-scoring companies (Piotroski score of at least 7) in the Indian market (using a July 2021 presentation by Aditya Birla Capital) showed returns over two years that were comparable to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This suggested that the original scoring system might be missing crucial elements, primarily [[Evaluating Stock Performance Using Financial Ratios | valuations]] â€“ the price at which a fundamentally strong company is a good buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Modified Piotroski Score

Research from BITS Pilani proposed a [[Modified Piotroski Score Incorporating Market Factors | modified Piotroski Score]] to achieve higher internal investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This modification involved:
*   **Removing variables:** RoA (Return on Assets) and Operating Cash Flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Introducing new variables:**
    *   [[understanding_pe_ratios | Price-to-Earnings (P/E) multiple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>
    *   Price-to-Book value ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>
    *   Enterprise Value upon EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>
    *   Incremental changes in the firm's free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>

These additions represent a clear attempt to incorporate market-driven metrics and identify undervalued companies from a list of fundamentally strong ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Additionally, the research team included two technical indicators:
*   Moving Average Crossover (to identify uptrends and stocks to buy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   Average Directional Movement Index (to gauge trade strength) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

[[Backtesting and Evaluating Piotroski Score Effectiveness | Backtesting]] this modified 13-variable approach showed significant improvements in analyzed returns and the Sharpe ratio, suggesting its potential effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

The Piotroski Score, by focusing on factors like profitability, leverage, liquidity, and operating efficiency, aims to provide investors with a systematic approach to [[Evaluating company robustness using the fragility scorecard | evaluate]] and differentiate between promising and risky investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. While not foolproof and subject to dynamic changes in company financials, certain aspects of the system can enhance the chances of selecting suitable companies for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

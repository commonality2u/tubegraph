While the [[magic_formula_investing_strategy_by_joel_greenblatt | Magic Formula Investing Strategy by Joel Greenblatt]] has demonstrated strong performance, its implementation requires careful consideration of several factors to avoid potential pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04">[01:04]</a>. The term "magic" in the name is primarily a marketing device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27">[01:27]</a>.

## Key Considerations and Challenges

### 1. Excluding Specific Sectors and Geographies
The [[magic_formula_investing_strategy_by_joel_greenblatt | Magic Formula]] framework explicitly excludes financial companies and utilities, likely due to their distinct financing structures involving large amounts of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09">[05:09]</a>. Foreign companies and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are also ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26">[05:26]</a>. Manual filtering may be necessary for these exclusions, as was the case for the speaker during their simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17">[06:17]</a>.

### 2. Handling Cyclical Sectors
A significant challenge lies in identifying and adjusting for cyclical sectors, such as metal and mining companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25">[12:25]</a>. These companies can show temporarily high operating incomes (EBIT), artificially inflating their earnings yield and Return on Capital (ROC) scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31">[12:31]</a>.

[!TIP|Addressing Cyclicality]
To mitigate this, investors can:
*   Use normalized earnings, averaging earnings over the last five to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47">[12:47]</a>.
*   Omit companies from highly cyclical sectors altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52">[12:52]</a>.

### 3. Impact of High Cash Balances on Earnings Yield
Companies with significant cash balances can present a misleadingly high earnings yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56">[12:56]</a>. This is because the Enterprise Value (EV), used in the earnings yield calculation, subtracts cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06">[13:06]</a>. A large cash balance can drastically reduce the denominator (EV), leading to an exaggerated earnings yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09">[13:09]</a>.

> "Say you come across a printing press business which has an advanced machine that is worth one crore rupees this business earns about 20 lakhs a year which by my definition comes to a return on investment of 20 but this business also has 80 lakhs of cash in its current account for whatever reason now since we are using Enterprise Value the EV will come to 100 minus 80 that is 20 lakhs which will take my 20 Roi number to 100 percent which in my view will be a misrepresentation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16">[13:16]</a>

This "misrepresentation" can lead to selecting companies that appear cheaper than they are based on their core operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42">[13:42]</a>.

### 4. Beyond the Numbers: Qualitative Analysis
Relying solely on a [[factorbased_investing | factor-based investing]] screener for the [[magic_formula_investing_strategy_by_joel_greenblatt | Magic Formula]] can be insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53">[13:53]</a>. It is crucial to supplement the quantitative screening with a qualitative analysis of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57">[13:57]</a>.

[!WARNING|Do Not Blindly Trust Screeners]
Additional analysis should include:
*   The company's business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57">[13:57]</a>
*   Its financial statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59">[13:59]</a>
*   Seasonality of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00">[14:00]</a>
*   Integrity of the promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01">[14:01]</a>
*   The company's growth runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03">[14:03]</a>

This holistic approach helps in avoiding stocks that might look good on paper but have underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50">[13:50]</a>.

### 5. Balancing Cheapness and Quality
The [[magic_formula_investing_strategy_by_joel_greenblatt | Magic Formula]] combines earnings yield (cheapness) and Return on Capital (quality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40">[02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24">[03:24]</a>. However, a company might rank high in one metric but low in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21">[07:21]</a>. For example, a brilliantly run business (high ROC) might be very expensive (low earnings yield) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26">[07:26]</a>. The formula's combined score aims to provide a balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41">[07:41]</a>.

### 6. Persistence and Portfolio Management
The strategy requires persistence for at least five years to derive maximum benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45">[09:45]</a>. It also involves a yearly rebalancing process that accounts for taxation: selling losing stocks in the 51st week to book short-term capital losses and selling winners in the 53rd week to realize long-term capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53">[08:53]</a>. The proceeds are then reinvested following the formula's steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21">[09:21]</a>. This active management and adherence to the process over time are crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27">[09:27]</a>.

### 7. DIY vs. Third-Party Solutions
Implementing the [[magic_formula_investing_strategy_by_joel_greenblatt | Magic Formula]] can be a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) process, involving the nine detailed steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10">[12:10]</a>. Alternatively, investors can use lists from websites like Value Research Online or Screener.in, or invest via platforms like Smallcase or WealthDesk, though availability and historical performance of these third-party options should be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18">[14:18]</a>. A dedicated research-based DIY approach is suggested as the best recourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18">[15:18]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_and_lessons_in_investing | challenges]], the [[magic_formula_investing_strategy_by_joel_greenblatt | Magic Formula]] is considered a powerful heuristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45">[15:45]</a>. Its simplicity with only two variables (earnings yield and Return on Capital) makes it easy to understand, implement, and track, providing a clear strategy for wealth creation in the stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53">[15:53]</a>.

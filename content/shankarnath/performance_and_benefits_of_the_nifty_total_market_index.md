The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) periodically issues warnings about market segments, such as the small and midcap segments, which can lead to confusion among investors about when to [[investment_strategies_using_the_nifty_total_market_index|invest]] or exit a particular index, or if there are gaps in their asset allocation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These warnings, while well-intentioned, can cause uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This highlights the need for a more comprehensive investment solution, leading to the discussion of the Nifty Total Market Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Understanding the Need for a Total Market Index

Traditional indices like the Nifty50 or Sensex 30 only represent a fraction of the total Indian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   The Nifty50, for example, represents the weighted average of India's 50 largest companies listed on the National Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   It ignores hundreds of mid-sized, small, and microcap companies, whose combined weighting is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   While Nifty50 consists of 100% large caps, it only accounts for less than 64% of India's total market capitalization, implying it represents only about half of the Indian stock market when considering other large-cap indices like Nifty Next 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   Similar inadequacies exist in other global markets, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, which represents only 29% of the US stock market's total capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## What is the Nifty Total Market Index?

The Nifty Total Market Index is a relatively new solution designed to provide a more comprehensive view of the Indian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   It tracks 750 stocks, covering large cap, mid cap, small cap, and micro cap segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   This single index represents approximately 96% of India's total stock market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   It consists of all stocks within the Nifty 500 and the [[features_of_nifty_smallcap_250_index|Nifty Microcap 250 Index]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Calculated on a free-float market capitalization basis, it means the largest companies have the biggest impact, but even the smallest companies (e.g., those with less than 2,000 crores in market cap) are included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The list of constituents is reviewed semi-annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   Unlike the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis|Nifty50]], which is heavily concentrated in financial services and IT, the Total Market Index is more dispersed, with companies from 22 different sectors, including those from mid, small, and micro cap segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   It is considered the truest representation of the Indian stock market to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices|Performance Analysis]]

The presence of midcap and small cap companies significantly influences the [[performance_analysis_in_indian_stock_market|performance]] of the Nifty Total Market Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Recent Returns**: In the last year, the Nifty Total Market Index delivered 41%, largely supported by the midcap and small cap rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Returns**: On average, there is at least a 0.5% alpha (outperformance) compared to other indices, irrespective of the timeline (3-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year, or 15-year trailing returns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This 0.5% alpha translates to a 7% increase in corpus over a 15-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **SIP Performance**: A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of 10,000 rupees per month since January 2009 (over 15 years) would have resulted in a corpus of almost 1 crore at an annualized return of 14.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Correlation and Volatility**: The Nifty Total Market Index generally moves in line with the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis|Nifty50]], with a correlation of 0.96 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. On a volatility basis, it appears to operate at a slightly lower standard deviation compared to the Nifty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. However, investors should factor in that the 30-35% allocation to midcap, small cap, and micro cap segments can lead to long phases of both underperformance and overperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Applications and Benefits of the Nifty Total Market Index

The Nifty Total Market Index offers several compelling applications for investors, particularly for those looking to create wealth via equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### 1. Substituting the [[comparison_of_nifty_total_market_index_and_nifty_50|Nifty50]] in Portfolios
This is a straightforward application for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Simplicity**: It is simple to understand and a passively managed instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: It is well-diversified across stocks and sectors, reducing the need to worry extensively about asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Higher Returns**: It tends to offer slightly higher returns than the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis|Nifty50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Investment Methods**:
    *   **Mutual Fund**: Invest in a mutual fund scheme that specifically tracks the Nifty Total Market Index (e.g., Grow Mutual Fund offers one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
    *   **Combination**: Achieve similar results by combining a Nifty 500 Index Fund with a [[features_of_nifty_smallcap_250_index|Nifty Microcap 250 Index]] scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This requires a specific allocation, such as 9,500 rupees to Nifty 500 and 500 rupees to Microcap 250 for every 10,000 rupees invested, to reflect the actual index composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### 2. Combining with an International Total Market Index
This strategy involves combining the Nifty Total Market Index with a non-domestic, international total market index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Examples**: This could include the US Total Stock Market Fund of Fund (like Vanguard Total Stock Market Index or VTSAX) or developed world indices fund of funds offered by Indian AMCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Reduced Volatility**: An 80/20 split (80% domestic, 20% international) over a 17-year period showed that while returns were similar, the India-international combination portfolio was significantly less volatile than investing in a standalone index like the Nifty Total Market Index or [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis|Nifty50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Improved [[performance_analysis_in_indian_index_funds|Risk-Adjusted Returns]]**: This setup effectively reduces a portfolio's volatility for the same level of return, leading to an improvement in [[performance_analysis_in_indian_index_funds|risk-adjusted returns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### 3. As a Pivot for Long-Term Wealth Creation Portfolio
The Nifty Total Market Index can serve as a central component around which investors build their long-term portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Simplified Asset Allocation**: For those comfortable with a 60:20:20 (large, mid, small cap) allocation, the Nifty Total Market Index adequately covers this, including a small dose of micro cap companies, eliminating the need for multiple schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Custom Combinations**: For more specific allocations, such as a 2:1:1 (50% large caps, 25% mid caps, 25% small caps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, investors can combine the Nifty Total Market Index with other indices like the Nifty Mids Small Cap 400 Index when they become available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This flexibility allows for tailoring portfolios to specific risk appetites and return objectives.

## Conclusion

The Nifty Total Market Index presents a compelling option for investors seeking a robust and simplified approach to equity investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Low Cost**: It is a low-cost investing vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: It provides diversification across stocks and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

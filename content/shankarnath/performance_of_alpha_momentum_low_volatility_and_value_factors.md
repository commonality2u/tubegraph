Two significant trends are currently visible in investing: a shift from actively managed schemes to passive ones, with increasing investment in index funds and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The second is a generational shift in index investing from market cap-based approaches to factor-based ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The smart beta category in India has grown to an AUM of approximately 22,000 Crores and is expanding rapidly with new fund launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Smart beta indices can help achieve better returns, improve diversification, and reduce portfolio risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## What is Smart Beta?

Smart beta refers to a passively managed investment strategy that combines characteristics like value, size, volatility, momentum, and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. While this discussion focuses on five primary factors, over 100 factors exist, including standard variables like profitability and sales growth, and unusual ones like sentiment analysis, cybersecurity, human capital, and social media influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. These factors differentiate from conventional market capitalization-based stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Roughly 40 different strategies are available on niftyindexes.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, but due to the availability of corresponding index funds or ETFs, this analysis focuses on the investable universe of about 25 smart beta ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Alpha Factor

Alpha, or Jensen's measure, was developed by Michael Jensen in the late 1960s to evaluate mutual fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It calculates the difference in a stock's performance compared to market returns, with a higher alpha value indicating better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Alpha-based Indices and ETFs
*   **Nifty50 Alpha 50 ETF:** A portfolio of 50 stocks with high alphas over the past year, selected passively from the top 300 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Nifty 200 Alpha 30 Fund:** Selects 30 stocks from within the Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 ETF:** India's first multi-factor ETF, launched in 2020 by ICICI Prudential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It combines alpha and low volatility factors to offer growth and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Performance Observations
On a trailing basis, the two single-factor alpha indexes (Nifty50 Alpha 50 and Nifty 200 Alpha 30) have performed exceptionally well, often beating broader indexes like the Nifty 200 and Nifty 500 by 10% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index aims for a balance between performance, volatility, and downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Jensen's alpha tends to perform exceptionally well in certain years (e.g., 2007, 2015, 2017, 2021, 2023, and the first half of 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. In other years, performance is generally aligned with market cap indices, with notable poor years in 2008, 2016, 2018, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. There's an observed pattern of mean reversion: a good year for the Alpha 50 index is often followed by a disappointing one (e.g., 2007 good, 2008 bad; 2009 good, 2010 bad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Tactically, one might invest in the Alpha 50 after a bad year and exit after a prosperous one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. As of 2024, given a significant run-up since early 2023, caution is advised for lump sum investments in purely alpha-based indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. However, a long-term strategy with SIPs in an alpha factor index is viable, given its 20%+ compounding over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

For investors who prefer less volatility but still seek above-average performance, the Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index is a strong option, offering better downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Over 17.5 years, the Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30's performance was comparable to Alpha 50 and surpassed the Nifty 200 Alpha 30, achieving similar returns with lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. All three alpha indices have demonstrated better returns compared to market cap indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Low Volatility Factor

The conventional wisdom suggests higher risk leads to greater returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. However, analysis of the Nifty 100 Low Volatility 30 ETF shows it outperformed the Nifty 100 on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The premise that low-risk portfolios can outperform high-risk ones gained popularity after the 2008 global financial crisis as investors favored defensive, less volatile stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. While various studies support this, the performance difference has not been very sharp in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Low volatility indices are generally expected to perform well in bear markets, as seen during the 2008-2011 period when safety and valuations were prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Strategic Use
For predominantly large-cap investors, opting for a low volatility large-cap index offers better performance and lower risk than the Nifty50 or Nifty 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The low volatility factor is the largest category among strategy-based ETFs and index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Value Factor

The value factor is based on the idea that companies with lower valuations tend to generate high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. As "value" is not a single accounting metric, it uses variables like Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, Price-to-Sales, dividend yield, and buyback history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Value-based ETFs
*   **S&P BSE Value Index:** Combines book value, price, earnings, and sales to derive a value score applied to the BSE large midcap index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Nifty50 Value 20 Index:** Ranks and weights companies based on Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

The value index acts as an antithesis to growth-oriented factors like alpha, momentum, and standard market cap-based indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Performance Observations
The Nifty50 Value 20 index has generally outperformed its market cap-based counterpart in most years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. However, the performance differences have often been narrow, with exceptions in 2020, 2021, and 2023 when the value factor was more dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Small increments in returns add up, resulting in a 14.7% CAGR for the value index compared to 11.8% for the market cap index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

When compared against Nifty50 Alpha 20, Nifty 200 Alpha 30, and Nifty 200 Momentum 30, value shows wide performance differences, often exceeding 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This weak correlation between value and momentum led to the creation of "two lifetime funds" strategies, suggesting [[performance_analysis_of_momentum_vs_value_funds | combining momentum and value]].

### Strategic Use
The period since 2008, characterized by high liquidity, low interest rates, and the rise of tech companies, has seen growth stocks and indices largely outperform value counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. However, market cycles turn, often for 7-8 year periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Value tends to outperform when the market is recovering from a bear phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, as observed in 2009 (after the 2008 financial crisis), 2017 (after 2016), 2021, and 2023 (as equities recovered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Momentum Factor

The momentum factor suggests that stocks performing well in the past will continue to do so, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. In essence, "winners keep on winning, and losers keep on losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Momentum-based ETFs
Within the Indian ETF universe, the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 is a prominent scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Mid-cap, small-cap, and multi-factor variants of momentum are also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Performance Observations
[[performance_analysis_of_momentum_indices | Momentum indices]] have significantly outperformed their market cap-weighted counterparts in both the short and long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. On a year-on-year basis, the [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum strategy]] performs exceptionally well during rapidly rising stock markets (e.g., 2007, 2009, 2014, 2017, 2021, 2023, and the first half of 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Conversely, it shows weakness when bear markets set in (e.g., 2008, 2011, 2018, and 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

### Strategic Use
The most opportune time to invest in a momentum ETF or index fund seems to be when 10-year government of India bond yields are coming down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This correlation has been observed across different time periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. While tactical play is possible, a long-term approach with SIPs is also advocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Quality Factor

Unlike other factors, there's no single consensus on what "quality" exactly means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Generally, a quality company is characterized by high profitability, a strong balance sheet, and little or no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### Quality-based ETFs
A good number of quality ETF options are available, including variants around the Midcap 150, Nifty 100, and Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

### Performance Observations
The Nifty 200 and Nifty 200 Quality 30 have performed neck-to-neck on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Surprisingly, the Midcap 150 Quality 50 index has underperformed its market cap-based counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Year-on-year, there hasn't been significant difference in returns for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. There's also limited evidence that quality offers significant downside protection or outperforms in a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Overall Performance and Strategic Implications

Smart beta indices generally outperform market cap-based indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

For a conservative risk profile seeking stable growth through equities, the low volatility factor is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. It offers better than market cap returns and has a lower standard deviation (risk) compared to other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index is a strong choice for conservative profiles, combining low volatility with slightly better performance than pure low volatility indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. For downside protection, low volatility is the best bet, followed by the quality factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

When comparing the Nifty50 index with smart beta factors, the Nifty50 has rarely held the top rank in performance, spending nearly 70% of the years in the lower half of the ranking table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Conversely, the alpha factor and the [[momentum_and_value_investing | momentum factor]] have spent only about one-third of their time below average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Notably, momentum has never ranked last in 19 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

### Factor Preferences based on Performance Ranking:
*   **Nifty50:** Often delivers average or below-average returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Quality Factor:** Suspect performance, spending two-thirds of its time in the lower half of rankings, with performance similar to the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Low Volatility:** A "middlesome" factor, but surprisingly has seen more first-place rankings than momentum, making it suitable for profiles prioritizing stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   **Momentum:** Shows consistency and is recommended for permanent portfolio allocation rather than just tactical play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Alpha and Value Factors:** Exhibit extreme performance, ranging from top ranks in some years to poor performance in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This suggests these factors are best played tactically, by identifying opportune entry and exit points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

Investing in smart beta ETFs and funds is a smarter approach to wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

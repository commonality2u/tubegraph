Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platforms facilitate lending and borrowing activities between individuals and entities. These platforms often serve as sourcing partners for NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company) P2P partners, matching borrowers and lenders based on their desired risk-return profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

As of the transcript, there are 25 registered P2P lenders listed on the RBI's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## How P2P Lending Works

P2P entities function primarily as facilitators, providing lenders with a selection of borrowers based on criteria such as:
*   Preferred loan criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>
*   Location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>
*   Employment history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>
*   Reason for availing the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>
*   Loan tenure, typically ranging from 3 to 36 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>
*   Desired rate of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>

Platforms like The 12 Club, Redmond, or MovieKick connect borrowers and lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. They may offer features designed to attract investors, including:
*   9-12% annual interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>
*   No lock-ins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>
*   Daily credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>
*   Low initial deposit amounts, starting from as little as 1000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>

## Returns Expectation

*   Investors lending on a P2P platform may have an interest expectation of 7% to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   Borrowers typically borrow at an annual Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 10% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   According to the Equiloans website, lenders can anticipate a net pre-tax yield ranging from 7.5% to 10% on their net invested amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Risks Associated with P2P Lending

The primary risk in any lending business is borrower default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   Quoted default rates on these platforms are generally cited at 3% to 6%, though this might be considered low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   An anecdotal account noted mixed results: one successful lending experience yielded over 12%, while a subsequent one resulted in two out of 15 borrowers defaulting, reducing returns to approximately 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Tips for Investors

For those considering experimenting with P2P lending, several tips can help mitigate risks:
*   Start with small sums of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   Avoid being swayed solely by high interest rates, as higher rates often correlate with higher potential default risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   Always assess the borrower's profile before extending a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   Lend to multiple borrowers rather than just one to diversify and spread out risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker expresses a non-committal stance on P2P lending, indicating a need for more information before deciding to invest in these products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. However, interest in alternative investment products, including P2P lending, is increasing among investors, especially High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs), family offices, and wealthy retirees, for portfolio diversification and recurring income generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. Some of these products could potentially form part of a fixed-income opportunity portfolio, potentially as a "satellite fixed income portfolio" or "opportunity portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

[[FactorBased Investing | Factor investing]] is presented as a strategy for enhancing returns on equity mutual fund investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This approach focuses on specific characteristics or attributes of stocks that have historically influenced performance and returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## What is a Factor?
A factor is defined as a specific characteristic or attribute that can significantly influence the performance and returns of a particular stock or portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## Common Factors in Investing
While there are numerous factors, some of the more popular ones include:
*   [[Overview of Common Factors in Investing | Momentum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>
*   [[Overview of Common Factors in Investing | Value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>
*   [[Overview of Common Factors in Investing | Low Volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>
*   [[Overview of Common Factors in Investing | Quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>

For more detailed information, existing resources on this topic are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Impact on Portfolio Returns
Comparisons of [[FactorBased Investing | Factor indices]] with the Nifty50 have shown that returns from these factors were often higher than what the Nifty50 delivered in most years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The Nifty50 frequently "languished at rank four or rank five" when ranked against various factor indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

This suggests a direction for investors to look beyond traditional market-cap-based portfolio development and consider [[Strategy Indices and FactorBased Investing | strategy-based portfolios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. For instance, combining a momentum-based factor index with a value-based one resulted in a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 16.2% over 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## Implementation Advice
While a complete switch to factor investing is not necessarily recommended, investors can allocate a smaller portion of their portfolio, such as 10-15%, to [[Ways to Invest in FactorBased Strategies | certain strategies]] based on factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

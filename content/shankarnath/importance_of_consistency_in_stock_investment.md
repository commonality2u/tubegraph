Ambit Capital's "10 Bagger Portfolio," which has delivered an annualized return of 22% over 11 years, incorporates the [[key_principles_of_stock_market_investing | principle]] of consistency in its selection framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This approach highlights that a company's "road to greatness" is paved by its ability to consistently improve its structural strengths over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Ambit's "Greatness Framework" and Consistency

The "Greatness Framework" used by Ambit Capital assesses companies based on several factors, with a strong emphasis on consistent performance:

*   **Structural Strengths:** A company's greatness is linked to its consistent improvement in structural strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Sales Growth:** The framework measures sales growth against its standard deviation to ensure consistency of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **PBIT Margins:** Ambit not only evaluates the growth in Profit Before Interest and Tax (PBIT) margins over a six-year period but also assesses consistency by measuring it against standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Cash Flow from Operations:** Consistency is also a key factor in evaluating a company's cash generation and profitability improvement from operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Evaluation Period:** All consistency checks are performed by measuring performance in two blocks of three years, factoring in the standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Dynamic Nature of "10-Bagger" Stocks

While the initial impression of a "10-Bagger" stock is that it will persist for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, Ambit's framework recognizes that consistency is difficult to maintain over extended periods:

*   **Low Persistence Rate:** Across many iterations of Ambit's greatness framework, only about 35% of the companies continue to qualify for the list over the subsequent two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This indicates that while companies might lose their "shine," they can re-qualify in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Annual Revisions:** The 10-bagger framework is not a fixed portfolio; revisions are made annually, requiring investors to identify new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Rare Consistent Performers:** Out of over 100 companies identified by Ambit's framework, only five have been consistently high performers: Nestle India, Hindalco Industries, Abbott India, Page Industries, and Tata Elxsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Actionable Points for Investors

To apply the principles of consistency in personal [[improving_stock_and_mutual_fund_selection | stock selection]]:

*   **Check for Consistency:** Ensure that metrics like increased capital expenditure, sales growth, efficient capital use, improved profit margins, reduced debt-equity ratio, and increased cash flow from operations are consistent over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Reinvestment of Dividends:** Assume that any dividends received are reinvested back into the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Accounting and Governance Checks:** Filter out companies with corporate governance issues, questionable auditor reports, or high promoter share pledging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | **Valuation**]]: Select stocks that are attractively valued compared to their historical valuations, examining P/E ratio, Price to Book ratio, and EV to EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

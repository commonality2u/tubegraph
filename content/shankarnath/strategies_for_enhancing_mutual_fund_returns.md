Investors can actively improve their portfolio's overall returns even when their wealth is managed by others through mutual funds, ULIPs, and NPS accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This article outlines five distinct strategies to generate extra returns on equity mutual fund investments, drawing from historical data and visual analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## 1. Using Relative Indices for Buy/Sell Zones

One technique involves using relative index comparisons, particularly for smallcap and midcap funds, to determine ideal buy and sell periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. By visually dividing one index by another on platforms like TradingView, investors can create buy/sell zones based on simple observation without complex mathematical formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

This approach can be applied to Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) by:
*   Continuing the SIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Pausing the SIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Doubling the SIP amount when the relative index is in the bottom third (a buying zone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

A simulation over 13 years (October 2010 to September 2023) showed that this strategy could yield a higher corpus at a lower capital compared to a regular SIP, translating to an extra 0.5% to 1% in returns on an XIRR basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For lump sum investments, buying big during buying zones and redeeming during selling phases can result in significantly higher net gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## 2. Avoiding High-Risk Market Periods

Recognizing and avoiding participation in markets during high-risk periods can significantly boost returns, potentially increasing return expectations by 3-5% over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Historically, periods like the Asian financial crisis (1997), Dot-com bubble (2000), 2008, 2011, 2015, and 2018 (for midcap and smallcap) have shown signs of extreme risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Key indicators to recognize high-risk periods:

### Parabolic Rally
This occurs towards the end of a bull market where prices surge by 30-40% over a very short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. For example, the Nifty jumped 49% in four months leading up to its peak in December 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Similar patterns were observed in China (136% in 8 months) and the NASDAQ 100 (30% in 5-6 months after doubling over 2 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Market Cap to GDP Ratio
In the Indian context, this ratio typically ranges between 50% and 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   Below 60%: Time to be aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   Above 90%: Time to be cautious with equity investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Market Breadth
This refers to the overall health of the market, comparing advancing stocks to declining ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A narrowing breadth, where a limited number of stocks are rising while others fall, indicates weakness and a potential correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### Additional Indicators:
*   **VIX (Volatility Index)**: A high VIX suggests waiting for it to cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Google Trends**: Heightened interest in speculative topics like penny stocks indicates an overheating market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **F&O Turnover**: A rising F&O (Futures and Options) turnover suggests increased speculation, warranting caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Investors should use these metrics to be aggressive when odds are favorable and cautious when conditions are unfavorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Instead of a complete switch, one can gradually reduce equity exposure (e.g., from 80% to 70%, then 60%) when high-risk situations persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. As Mark Minervini stated, the key to super performance is minimizing losses when wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## 3. Buying the Dip in an Upward Trending Market

"Buying the dip" involves purchasing securities whose price has experienced a temporary decline (typically 15-20%) within an overall upward-trending market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This strategy focuses on taking advantage of smaller blips within a larger rising wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Indicators for buying the dip and managing risk:

*   **200-Day Moving Average (200 DMA)**: This tool helps determine optimal points for lump sum investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. A widening price gap (e.g., 17-20% above the 200 DMA) suggests markets are expensive, signaling a time to exit or avoid further investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
    *   **Entry Points**: An RSI below 30 typically indicates an entry point for long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
    *   **Risk Management/Exit**: When RSI goes above 70, it often indicates a correction is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Divergence analysis on RSI can help spot weakening trends and potential exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

The effectiveness of this strategy is enhanced when a price decline is combined with an overall upward market trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## 4. P/E Ratio Based Investing

The P/E (Price-to-Earnings) ratio is a reliable metric for broad market analysis and can be used to tweak SIP strategies to gain an extra 1-2% in portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Different strategies based on P/E ratio:
*   **Simple SIP (Irrespective of P/E)**: Delivered a 13% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Ignoring Expensive Valuations**: Investing only when the P/E ratio is 22 or lower resulted in a 13.2% CAGR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Buying**: Investing regularly, but doubling down when the P/E ratio falls below 18, increased returns to 13.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Redeeming at High P/E**: Redeeming some money when the P/E ratio went above 22 yielded a 13.7% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Combined Accelerated Buying and Selling**: Employing an accelerated buying and selling structure at different P/E bands achieved a 14.7% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## 5. Factor Investing

Factor investing involves selecting stocks or portfolios based on specific characteristics or attributes ("factors") that influence performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Popular factors include:
*   Momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>
*   Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>
*   Low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>
*   Quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>

Comparison of factor indices with the Nifty 50 has shown that factor-based strategies often deliver higher returns in most years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. For instance, combining momentum-based and value-based factor indices yielded a 16.2% CAGR over 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

Investors are encouraged to look beyond market-cap-based portfolio development and consider allocating a smaller portion (e.g., 10-15%) of their portfolio to strategy-based investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

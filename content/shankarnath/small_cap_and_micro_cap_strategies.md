The Trending Value Strategy is an investment approach that has demonstrated significant outperformance against the broader market index, yielding an annualized return of 21.2% over a 45-year period (from January 1964 to December 2009) compared to the index's 11.2% [00:00:02 | 00:00:07 | 00:01:45 | 00:02:25]. This strategy, detailed by James O'Shaughnessy in his book *What Works on Wall Street*, focuses on identifying winning investment strategies through historical market data analysis and backtesting [00:00:31 | 00:00:38].

The core of the Trending Value Strategy lies in combining two fundamental investment factors: momentum and value [00:01:07 | 00:01:15]. It aims to select stocks that are both undervalued and have shown strong price momentum [00:01:36 | 00:01:40].

## The Power of Combining Value and Momentum

Individually, both value and momentum strategies offer competitive returns:
*   **Value Strategy:** Buying undervalued stocks, as per O'Shaughnessy's value composite 2 indicator, delivered an annualized return of 17.3% [00:01:53 | 00:02:01].
*   **Momentum Strategy:** Buying stocks with the best six-month price appreciation yielded 14.5% per annum [00:02:06 | 00:02:12].

However, the combination of value and momentum in the Trending Value Strategy has proven to be superior, not only outperforming the index but also the single-factor strategies, with the added benefit of lower volatility [00:02:17 | 00:02:35].

## Constructing a Trending Value Portfolio

To implement this strategy, investors calculate both a value score and a momentum score for companies [00:02:41 | 00:05:54].

### Calculating the Value Score

The value score is derived from six financial metrics [00:02:46]:
1.  **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Multiple:** Lower is better [00:02:48].
2.  **Price-to-Book (P/B) Value:** Lower is better, especially for capital-intensive businesses [00:02:54].
3.  **Price-to-Cash Flow from Operations:** Lower indicates attractive cash flow generation [00:03:03].
4.  **Price-to-Sales:** O'Shaughnessy's preferred metric; lower is better [00:03:14 | 00:03:17].
5.  **EV/EBITDA:** Assesses a company's overall value (market cap + debt) relative to earnings; lower is typically better [00:03:21 | 00:03:29].
6.  **Dividend Yield:** Higher dividend relative to share price is preferred (sometimes replaced by shareholder yield in updated methodologies) [00:03:34 | 00:03:46].

**Process for Value Score Allocation:**
1.  **Define the Universe:** Select a broad base of companies, for example, those with a market capitalization of at least 500 crores [00:04:00 | 00:04:06].
2.  **Collect Data:** Gather the six required financial metrics for each company [00:04:13].
3.  **Download to Worksheet:** Organize data for easier handling [00:04:23].
4.  **Allocate Deciles:** Rank all companies for each of the six variables and assign a score (e.g., 1 point for the first decile, 5 for the fifth decile). A lower score indicates a more undervalued company [00:04:36 | 00:05:11 | 00:05:17].
5.  **Calculate Cumulative Score:** Sum the scores across all six metrics for each company to get a cumulative value score [00:05:24 | 00:05:27]. A lower cumulative score indicates greater undervaluation [00:05:32].

### Calculating the Momentum Score

The momentum score identifies companies with strong recent stock performance [00:05:54].
1.  **Reduce Universe:** Filter the initial list to include only companies in the top decile based on their combined value scores (e.g., the top 150 companies from a universe of 1500) [00:06:11 | 00:06:15 | 00:06:20].
2.  **Extract Six-Month Price Return:** Obtain the six-month price appreciation data for these filtered companies [00:06:04 | 00:06:45].
3.  **Select Top Performers:** Sort the list in descending order by six-month price return and choose the top 25 stocks. These 25 stocks form the trending value portfolio [00:06:51 | 00:06:54 | 00:06:57]. O'Shaughnessy found that 25 stocks yielded the highest risk-adjusted returns [00:07:08 | 00:07:10].

This portfolio is then rebalanced annually [00:07:17].

## Observations and Implementation Considerations

When considering the Trending Value Strategy, especially in the Indian context, several observations are pertinent [00:07:38 | 00:07:54]:
*   **Price Movement and Momentum:** A significant portion of price appreciation in selected stocks may have occurred recently, highlighting the momentum component [00:07:44 | 00:07:47].
*   **Market Style Awareness:** The prevailing market style (e.g., growth vs. value) will influence the performance of these stocks. Value stocks, after periods of "hibernation," can experience massive price jumps when market attention shifts [00:08:00 | 00:08:02].
*   **Annual Rebalancing:** Regular annual rebalancing is crucial for maintaining the strategy's effectiveness [00:08:15 | 00:08:18].
*   **Financial Metrics:** While these stocks display value characteristics (low P/E, P/B, Price-to-Sales), they often have single-digit Return on Capital (ROC) and sales growth, typical of classical value investing. However, their EPS growth can be better, indicating their cyclical nature [00:08:27 | 00:08:32 | 00:08:35 | 00:08:39 | 00:08:41].
*   **Value Trap Avoidance:** The momentum component acts as a safeguard, ensuring that these undervalued stocks are not "value traps" (stocks that appear cheap but continue to decline) [00:08:50].

## Performance in the Indian Context

A study by Capitalmind, which backtested the trending value strategy on Indian stocks from 2007 to 2023 (a 16-year period), provided valuable insights [00:09:11 | 00:09:17 | 00:09:20]:
*   **Market Capitalization Bias:** The strategy predominantly involves [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap]] and [[understanding_microcap_stocks | micro cap]] companies. Approximately 79% of trades were with companies ranked between 500 and 1,500 in market capitalization, affirming that the trending value strategy is generally a [[strategies_for_smallcap_and_midcap_stock_selection | small cap strategy]] [00:09:33 | 00:09:38 | 00:09:44].
*   **Returns for Micro Caps:** [[microcap_investment_options | Micro caps]] were the biggest winners, suggesting the strategy thrives in this segment [00:09:51 | 00:09:53].
*   **Outperformance:** The study revealed a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.6% over the 16-year period, significantly outperforming the Nifty50's 9.9% [00:09:57 | 00:10:03]. This 10% alpha aligns with O'Shaughnessy's original findings [00:10:06 | 00:10:09].
*   **Volatility and Drawdowns:** Contrary to expectations of reduced volatility and drawdowns, the Indian study showed an opposite effect. This is attributed to the strategy's favorability towards [[characteristics_of_microcap_investing | small and micro caps]], which inherently exhibit higher volatility and drawdowns [00:10:13 | 00:10:20 | 00:10:24 | 00:10:28].
*   **Consistent Outperformance:** Rolling returns over a 10-year period consistently showed the strategy outperforming the Nifty50 [00:10:32 | 00:10:37 | 00:10:38].

## Key Takeaways

The Trending Value Strategy, particularly as a [[tactical_approaches_to_maximize_small_cap_investment_performance | small cap]] and [[understanding_microcap_stocks | micro cap]] approach, offers high returns but comes with specific characteristics [00:10:52 | 00:10:53]:
*   **Market Cycles:** It mimics [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small and micro cap]] market cycles, which, while offering high returns, are extremely volatile [00:10:56 | 00:10:59].
*   **Value Predominance:** Expect a portfolio dominated by value stocks (e.g., P/E ratio less than 12, annual sales exceeding market capitalization) [00:11:03 | 00:11:05 | 00:11:09].
*   **Lumpy Returns:** Returns may not be consistent; there will be periods of muted performance followed by sudden spikes [00:11:14 | 00:11:19 | 00:11:22].
*   **Risk Tolerance:** This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy requiring a high tolerance for volatility [00:11:41 | 00:11:43]. It may not suit investors primarily focused on [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | growth stocks]] [00:11:35 | 00:11:37].

Despite its challenges, the Trending Value Strategy has performed well globally and can be a valuable addition to an investor's toolkit [00:11:48 | 00:11:51 | 00:11:53 | 00:11:55].

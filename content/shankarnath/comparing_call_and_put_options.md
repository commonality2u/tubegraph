Options are a type of financial derivative that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price and date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. They expand investment possibilities beyond traditional stock trading, allowing investors to potentially profit when the market goes up, down, or remains relatively flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Options in General

Options are among five types of equity-specific derivative contracts, alongside forwards, futures, warrants, and swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. In certain countries, such as India, options and futures are the most popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. As of the video's recording, futures and options are available for trading on 198 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Call Options

A [[option_trading_strategies | call option]] gives its buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy an agreed quantity of a specific commodity or financial instrument from the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This right is valid within a specified time window, concluding on the expiration date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. The transaction is set at a certain price known as the strike price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, for which the buyer pays a small fee, called a premium, to the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Example Scenario (Call Option)

Consider Nestle, which wants to purchase coffee beans from a producer. To hedge against price volatility, Nestle pays a token amount (e.g., five lakh Rupees) to the producer, locking in the right to buy coffee beans worth one crore Rupees within two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

*   **Price Increases**: If the price of coffee goes up to 1.5 crores, Nestle would exercise its call option, buying at the agreed one crore and saving 45 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Price Decreases**: If the price drops to 70 lakhs, Nestle would not exercise the option, instead buying at the lower market price and saving 25 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Price Remains Flat**: If the price stays at one crore, Nestle would again not exercise the option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

In these scenarios, the call option benefits Nestle by protecting it from rising prices, while allowing it to take advantage of falling prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The coffee bean producer (the option seller) profits from the premium paid by Nestle if the price remains stable or falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Investor Sentiment for Call Options

An investor is typically bullish on a particular stock or an index (like the Nifty) when they opt to buy a [[option_trading_strategies | call option]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Conversely, one might sell a [[option_trading_strategies | call option]] if they are bearish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Put Options

A [[option_trading_strategies | put option]] is essentially a [[option_trading_strategies | call option]] in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The buyer of a [[option_trading_strategies | put option]] anticipates a fall in the price of the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Therefore, they want to retain the right to sell the asset at a higher price until the expiration date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Investor Sentiment for Put Options

When an investor buys a [[option_trading_strategies | put option]], they are typically bearish on the stock or index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. If an investor sells a [[option_trading_strategies | put option]], they are generally bullish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Foundational Option Trading Paths

Based on these definitions, there are four foundational paths in any [[option_trading_strategies | option trading strategy]]:
1.  **Buy a call option** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>
2.  **Sell a call option** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>
3.  **Buy a put option** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>
4.  **Sell a put option** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>

The choice of which option to buy or sell depends on an investor's view of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. More complex [[option_trading_strategies | option trading strategies]] combine these foundational elements to achieve various risk-reward profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

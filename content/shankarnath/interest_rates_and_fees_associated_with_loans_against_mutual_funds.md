[[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | Loans Against Mutual Funds (LAMF)]] offer a distinct advantage over traditional [[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | personal loans]] or credit cards, primarily due to their more favorable interest rates and flexible fee structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Interest Rates

One of the significant benefits of LAMF is the lower interest rate compared to [[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | personal loans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Typically, interest rates for [[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | loans against mutual funds]] range between 10% to 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

A key feature of LAMF is that interest is charged only on the money actually utilized from the sanctioned credit limit, not on the entire approved loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This contrasts sharply with [[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | personal loans]], where interest is typically levied on the full borrowed sum from the outset, regardless of how much is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

For example, a platform like Yeno offers attractive interest rates at 10.5% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## Associated Fees

The fee structure for [[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | loans against mutual funds]] is generally more straightforward and often less burdensome than other loan types:

*   **Processing Fee**: A one-time processing fee may be applied to the first transaction. For instance, Yeno charges 1,179 rupees (999 plus GST) on the initial withdrawal, but subsequent withdrawals do not incur this charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **No Foreclosure or Prepayment Charges**: Many LAMF providers, such as Yeno, do not impose foreclosure charges, prepayment fees, or withdrawal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This flexibility allows borrowers to repay their outstanding balance at any time without penalty, which is particularly beneficial for self-employed individuals with fluctuating cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Varying Fees by Institution**: While many digital platforms offer minimal fees, some traditional institutions might have higher charges or fees calculated as a percentage of the loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Extreme Circumstance Charges**: Lenders' agreements may outline additional charges applicable only in specific "extreme circumstances," such as bounced payments or liquidation penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## Overall Cost-Effectiveness

[[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | Loans against mutual funds]] are generally more cost-effective than [[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | personal loans]] or credit cards for immediate funding needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

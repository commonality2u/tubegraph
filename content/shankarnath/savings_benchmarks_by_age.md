This guide provides a series of financial benchmarks, indicating suggested portfolio sizes at different ages. It should be treated as a tracker or marker to identify potential gaps in savings and wealth building, rather than a definitive [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement planning]] calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A relevant worksheet is available to help individuals analyze and work with these figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Your 20s: Building the Foundation

For many young adults, the 20s often begin with negative savings, primarily due to student debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. For example, the fee for a full-time 2-year residential MBA program at MDI Gurgaon increased from 3.15 lakhs to 25 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Instead of a specific savings target, the focus in your 20s should be on establishing strong [[financial_habits_for_young_adults | financial habits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>:
*   **Budgeting:** Regularly track income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Emergency Fund:** Aim for two months' worth of expenses in an emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Insurance:** Obtain a term insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Saving:** Endeavor to save 5%, 10%, or even 15% of your salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The amount is less important than the consistency; even 2,000 Rupees a month can be invested via a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Credit Score:** Get a credit card to build a credit score, which is beneficial for future loans (car, home) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Always pay outstandings on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Your 20s are crucial for laying the foundations of financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Your 30s: First Major Benchmark

By your 30th birthday, your savings (or portfolio) should ideally equal your annual salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For instance, if your annual salary is 12 lakhs, your portfolio should be 12 lakhs or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Key assumptions for growth in the 30s:
*   **Annual Increments:** Estimated at 12% per annum, factoring in a 10% pay hike and a potential jump from a job change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Savings Rate:** Assumed at 20%, common for households with young children and often two working spouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Return:** Assumed at 10% annually, considering a mix of fixed income instruments (like PPF, EPF) and equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Based on these assumptions, if you start at age 30 with a portfolio equal to your annual income (e.g., 12 lakhs), by age 39:
*   Annual income could grow to 33 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   Annual savings could increase from 22,000 rupees/month to 55,000 rupees/month (factoring in inflation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   The portfolio value should significantly grow. By age 35, the portfolio-to-income ratio is almost 2:1 (e.g., 21 lakhs income, 42 lakhs portfolio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   By age 39, the corpus could be 2.7 times your annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

> It's important to note that wealth generation is not a straight line, and portfolio returns can fluctuate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Your 40s: Continued Growth

Entering your 40s, assuming an income of 36.6 lakhs and a portfolio just over 1 crore (as derived from the previous section) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Key assumptions for growth in the 40s:
*   **Annual Increments:** Taken at 10% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Savings Rate:** Reduced to 15% to accommodate increasing expenses for children and aging parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Return:** Kept at 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

By the age of 49, with these parameters, your portfolio should ideally be around 3.7 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, which translates to 4.3 times your then-annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

> You can tweak the numbers in the provided worksheet to suit your personal reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. When making estimates, aim for a mid-range approach, avoiding overly conservative or aggressive figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Your 50s: Approaching Retirement

At the age of 50, the expectation is to have a corpus of 4.3 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Key assumptions for growth in the 50s:
*   **Savings Rate:** Assumed at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Salary Increment:** Set at 8% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Annual Portfolio Return:** Maintained at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

With these assumptions, by age 60, when many consider active work boots, your portfolio should exceed 16 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This results in a portfolio-to-income ratio of eight times your pre-retirement gross income (16 crores corpus divided by 2 crores income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This conclusion aligns with studies by firms like T. Rowe Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Aiming for more than eight times is even better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Your 60s and Beyond: Post-Retirement Analysis

This section tests the longevity of the accumulated 16 crores for post-retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Assumptions for post-retirement:
*   **Expenses at Age 60:** Assuming a 20% savings rate means an 80% expense rate, equating to 1.6 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Expenses from Age 61 onwards:** With zero income, expenses are assumed to reduce to 60% of the 60th year's expenses, or 96 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Inflation:** Expenses are assumed to increase by 7% annually due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. So, 96 lakhs becomes 1.03 crores in the 61st year, then 1.1 crores the next year, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Returns:** Maintained at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

Even with portfolio growth, inflation causes expenses to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. In this simulation, the accumulated funds are projected to last until around the 82nd year mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This highlights the importance of prudent financial management and considering lifestyle adjustments in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## Recap

The simulated financial journey starts effectively from age 30, requiring savings equal to at least your annual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. The model uses simple variables: income, annual increments, initial corpus, [[Saving Strategies for FIRE | savings rate]], and [[Financialization of Household Savings | return on investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. For those aiming to retire around age 60, the goal is to accumulate assets totaling eight times their pre-retirement gross income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

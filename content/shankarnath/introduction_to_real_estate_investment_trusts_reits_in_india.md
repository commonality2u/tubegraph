A Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT, functions similarly to how a [[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | mutual fund]] operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. Retail investors provide capital to a REIT manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, who then invests in income-producing properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. These properties are primarily commercial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, but can also include hospitals, malls, and residential spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The rental income generated from these properties is distributed to investors in the form of dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## Advantages for Investors

From an investor's perspective, REITs offer several clear benefits:
*   **Affordability**: REITs make investing in [[indian_real_estate_industry_overview | commercial real estate]] more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   **Simplification**: They simplify the investment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, as investors do not need to maintain the property or pay direct taxes on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Professional Management**: REITs are professionally managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Regulation**: In India, REITs are regulated and monitored by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## REITs in India

The concept of REITs is relatively new for Indian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. The listing of Embassy Office Parks in 2019 initiated their presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, followed by Mindspace and Brookfield joining in 2020 and 2021, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. SEBI has been taking progressive steps to enhance the product's attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

### [[sebi_regulations_and_rules_governing_reits_in_india | SEBI Regulations]] for REITs

[[sebi_regulations_and_rules_governing_reits_in_india | SEBI's rules for REITs]] are complex, but three key points are essential for investors:
1.  **Property Investment Proportion (80/20 Rule)**: [[sebi_regulations_and_rules_governing_reits_in_india | SEBI]] mandates that 80% of a REIT's asset value must be in completed and income-generating real assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The remaining 20% can be invested in higher-risk assets like under-construction buildings, equity shares, or mortgage-backed securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This structure ensures that 80% of the portfolio is relatively safe and stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
2.  **Mandatory Distribution of Earnings**: REITs must distribute at least 90% of their net distributable cash earnings to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. For example, if a REIT receives 100 rupees in rent, at least 90 rupees must be returned to investors as dividends or interest, typically on a quarterly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Public Listing**: All [[sebi_regulations_and_rules_governing_reits_in_india | SEBI]]-registered REITs must be publicly listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>, allowing investors to buy units similar to how they purchase shares of a listed company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## How Investors Make Money

Investors can earn from a REIT in two primary ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>:
1.  **Dividends**: REITs typically offer a dividend yield of 5% to 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Capital Gains**: This occurs when the REIT's per-unit price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## [[investment_factors_and_evaluation_metrics_for_reits | Investment Factors and Evaluation Metrics]] for REITs

When evaluating a REIT for [[investment_factors_and_evaluation_metrics_for_reits | investment]], several factors should be considered:

### Net Asset Value (NAV) per Unit
The NAV per unit represents the market value of a REIT's properties minus its liabilities or debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Unlike [[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | mutual fund]] NAVs, a REIT's NAV is declared once every six months, not daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Comparing the NAV per unit with the REIT's market value can be an important valuation metric, as Indian REITs often trade at a discount of 14% to 16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Extreme market price to NAV periods can serve as excellent entry or exit points for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Occupancy Rate
A higher occupancy rate is generally better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. While the current occupancy rates are in the 87% to 89% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>, pre-COVID levels were often in the high 80s and even 90% plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. An acceptable range is typically 85% to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

### Weighted Average Lease Expiry (WALLE)
WALLE indicates the average time left before a property is expected to become vacant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. A higher WALLE is preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. Globally, a WALLE of five years is considered good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>, and current Indian REITs maintain a WALLE between six to seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

### Distribution Yield
The distribution yield represents the returns earned by REIT unit holders as a percentage of the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. Investors should be careful when comparing disclosed distribution yields, as some companies might calculate it based on the issue price rather than the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Quality
Portfolio quality consists of two variables:
1.  **Tenants**: A strong REIT is not overly dependent on a few clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. Diversifying the tenant base is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.
2.  **Geographical Spread**: While concentrating properties in a few locations can improve economics, it also introduces city-specific risks like lockdowns, floods, or political issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. A more spread-out and diverse geographical portfolio is generally better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

## [[tax_treatment_and_returns_on_reit_investments | Taxation Angle]]

[[tax_treatment_and_returns_on_reit_investments | REITs in India]] receive some tax exemptions on rental income and leasing interest, which helps reduce tax liability and generate higher income for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Investors earn returns in four ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>:
*   **Interest Income**: Taxable at the investor's income tax slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
*   **Amortization of SPV Debt (Return of Capital)**: This portion is entirely non-taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
*   **Capital Gains**:
    *   **Short-Term Capital Gains**: Taxed at 15% if units are held for less than one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Long-Term Capital Gains**: Taxed at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.
*   **Dividends**: Whether dividends are taxable for the investor depends on whether the REIT's Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) opted for a lower tax regime offered by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. If the SPV opted for concessions, dividends become taxable for the investor; otherwise, they are tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. The tax treatment of dividends can vary between REITs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

## Buying REIT Units

Units in REITs can be bought or sold in the secondary market through any trading platform, similar to buying shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. With the minimum buying quantity reduced to just one unit, individuals can invest in [[indian_real_estate_industry_overview | real estate]] via REITs starting from approximately 300 to 350 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

## Investment Exposure and Expectations

Given that REITs are a relatively new asset class in India and the laws are still maturing, it is advisable to limit exposure to not more than 10% of an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. From an expectation perspective, REITs are capable of delivering a 5% to 6% post-tax dividend yield and 4% to 5% in terms of capital appreciation, assuming thorough due diligence on the major [[investment_factors_and_evaluation_metrics_for_reits | factors discussed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.

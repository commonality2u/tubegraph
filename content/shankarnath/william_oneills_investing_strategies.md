William O'Neill, starting as a retail broker, became known for his innovative approach to analyzing stocks, being one of the first to put charts on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>. His book, "How to Make Money in Stocks," published in 2009, examines the best-performing stocks over 125 years to identify characteristics of winning stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.

O'Neill's [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investment philosophy]] aims to combine the best of both worlds: a fundamental layer for selecting strong companies and a technical layer to determine optimal buying and selling times for massive upward moves or when stocks are likely to lose favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>.

## The CAN SLIM Method

The CAN SLIM system, developed by William O'Neill in the 1950s, is a widely studied [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investment methodology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:15">[02:19:15]</a>. It's an acronym for a seven-step process or set of seven rules designed to help investors identify quality, high-growth stocks at an early stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>.

### C: Current Quarterly Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Winning stocks often show a sharp increase in quarterly earnings per share on a year-over-year basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:11">[02:40:11]</a>. Investors should look for EPS growth over 25%, with higher being better, especially if the growth is accelerating and accompanied by a similar increase in sales numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:14">[02:51:14]</a>.

### A: Annual Earnings

To ensure sustained growth, the CAN SLIM method also emphasizes examining the annual EPS growth over the last three years, aiming for an average of at least 25% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>.

### N: New (Products, Services, Management)

Significant advancements in a stock typically stem from something "new," such as innovative products, new markets, changes in government policies, new technology, or new management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:05">[04:06:05]</a>. O'Neill's studies indicate that 95% of "superstar" stocks in the last century had some form of newness as a catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:10">[04:29:10]</a>. Investors should identify companies at the forefront of industry trends by examining their track record of new product/service introductions, R&D efforts, patent filings, and product release schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:06">[04:50:06]</a>.

### S: Supply and Demand

This factor refers to the supply and demand of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:01">[05:06:01]</a>. O'Neill suggests looking for stocks with fewer shares outstanding, as this indicates restricted supply. Share buyback programs or significant equity interests from top management are also positive indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:04">[05:10:04]</a>. From a technical perspective, the ideal buying point is a breakout from previous resistance levels, often seen in [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | patterns]] like the cup and handle, indicating high demand from institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:12">[05:25:12]</a>.

### L: Leaders or Laggards

The simple rule here is to buy leaders and avoid laggards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Investors should focus on the number one, two, or at most three companies within a strong and leading industry group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:02">[05:58:02]</a>. These leaders typically have the highest relative strength, good market share, increasing EPS, and strong sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:08">[06:05:08]</a>. Relative strength (RS) measures a stock's price performance compared to the broader market or its industry peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:11">[06:16:11]</a>. The CAN SLIM method prefers companies with an RS value of at least 80, meaning they've outperformed 80% of other stocks in their industry or market group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

### I: Institutional Sponsorship

This refers to the ownership of a stock by large institutions such as mutual funds, pension funds, high-net-worth individuals, and insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Recent increases in institutional shareholding are generally viewed as a positive factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:14">[07:24:14]</a>. Large institutional deals are often visible on volume charts, and because these funds take weeks or months to build positions, retail investors can enter at an early stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:04">[07:37:04]</a>.

### M: Market Direction

The market direction is crucial, as O'Neill's studies show that three out of every four stocks follow the trend of the general market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Therefore, investors should only buy stocks when the broader market is trending up and avoid buying when it's trending down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:09">[08:17:09]</a>.

Key observations regarding market direction include:
*   **Bear Market Behavior**: Stocks tend to open strong but close weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:07">[08:37:07]</a>.
*   **Bull Market Behavior**: The opposite occurs, with stocks typically opening weak but closing strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:08">[08:42:08]</a>.
*   **Volume Analysis**: It's important to analyze price movements, chart [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | patterns]], and volumes. An increase in volumes along with an increase in share price indicates strong buying interest and a potentially positive market direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:06">[08:56:06]</a>.
*   **Distribution Days**: These occur when an index (e.g., Nifty 50) loses more than 0.2% of its value on a single day with higher volumes than the previous session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:04">[09:14:04]</a>. This suggests big institutional investors are exiting. While one or two distribution days are not problematic, successive distribution days signal market weakening, and investors should consider reducing positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:01">[09:37:01]</a>. A bull market often ends after four or five distribution days over a span of four to five weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:09">[09:50:09]</a>.

## Chart Patterns: The Cup and Handle

O'Neill's book emphasizes the importance of charts, as they provide a wealth of information and signals through stock price and volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:04">[11:22:04]</a>. One of O'Neill's favorite [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | patterns]] is the "Cup and Handle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:02">[11:37:02]</a>.

Elements of the Cup and Handle pattern:
1.  **Prior Uptrend**: There should be a preceding uptrend of at least 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:04">[11:57:04]</a>.
2.  **Depth of the Base**: Measured from the left peak to the lowest point of the cup, this depth should typically be between 15% and 30%, though it can reach 50% in severe bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:07">[12:05:07]</a>.
3.  **Base Length**: The minimum base length is seven weeks, as a shorter base may not allow enough time for prior gains to consolidate, increasing the chance of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
4.  **The Handle**: A mild pullback that typically lasts for about two to four weeks, with a depth of 10-12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:06">[12:36:06]</a>. Ideally, volume during the handle formation should not be high, as high volume indicates a serious sell-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:03">[13:00:03]</a>. A small, smooth, low-volume handle is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.
5.  **Ideal Buy Point**: This is normally just above the peak of the handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:14">[13:19:14]</a>. The buying range extends up to five percent above this point, but O'Neill recommends buying as close to the ideal buy point as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:09">[13:36:09]</a>.
6.  **Breakout Day**: On the day a stock surpasses its ideal buy point, the volume should be at least 40-50% higher than the normally traded volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:09">[13:50:09]</a>. Volume spikes of 100%, 200%, 500%, or even 1000% indicate strong institutional buying and notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:08">[14:03:08]</a>.

## Selling Strategies

O'Neill emphasizes that the secret to winning big in the stock market is not always being right, but rather losing the least amount of money when incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. As a strategy, he advises investors to cut losses if a stock declines by 7-8% from the buying price, with no exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:06">[14:56:06]</a>.

The book outlines nine selling scenarios:
1.  **Distribution Days**: Multiple days with a 0.2% index drop and increasing volume signal caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:03">[15:16:03]</a>.
2.  **Excessive Gain After Stock Split**: If a stock rises 25% or more within two weeks of a stock split, it's typically an excessive gain, and it's time to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:07">[15:27:07]</a>.
3.  **Breaching Upper Channel Line**: If a stock cuts through its upper channel line after a significant run-up, it can be a sell signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:10">[15:35:10]</a>.
4.  **New Highs with Dried Up Volume**: When a stock reaches new all-time highs but volume has dried up, it suggests a selling opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.
5.  **Poor Relative Strength**: A consistently poor Relative Strength (RS) is a sign of weakness and a reason to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:02">[15:54:02]</a>.
6.  **"Loan Ranger" Stock**: If a stock is the only one advancing in its industry group while others are constant or declining, it implies industry-wide issues or that the company has eliminated competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.
7.  **Closing at Day's Lowest Price**: If a stock consistently closes at its day's lowest price over many continuous days, vigilance is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.
8.  **Slowdown in Earnings Growth**: A slowdown (decrease in growth, not necessarily negative) in company earnings for two or more consecutive quarters provides a fundamental reason to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:04">[16:34:04]</a>.
9.  **12-15% Fall from Peak**: As a general rule, if a stock falls by 12-15% from its peak, it's likely a good idea to sell or at least review the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

The guiding principle for selling is that, just as it is important to buy at the opportune time, it is crucial to sell stocks at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

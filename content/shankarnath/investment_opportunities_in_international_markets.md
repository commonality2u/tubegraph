The concept of a "hidden PE of one" refers to companies where their future per-share earnings are likely to be significantly higher than their current share price, effectively making the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio appear much lower in the future, potentially reaching one [01:08:00]. While identifying such companies within domestic markets like India can be challenging due to factors like high debt levels, unstable operating margins, and corporate governance issues, looking to international markets may reveal promising opportunities [05:48:00].

## Identifying Hidden PE of One Companies

A P/E ratio of one signifies that a company's share price is equal to or less than its earnings per share over the last 12 months [00:59:00]. However, the focus is on a *hidden* P/E of one, meaning companies that currently have a high P/E but are projected to have significantly higher future earnings [01:08:00].

Key factors to consider when identifying such opportunities globally include:
*   **Profit Growth** The primary variable is significant profit growth. Companies consistently growing profits by more than 20% are more likely to achieve a hidden PE of one, even if their current P/E is high [03:39:00].
*   **Starting Valuation** Beginning with a lower current P/E ratio vastly improves a company's chances of reaching a PE of one sooner [04:31:00].
*   **Visibility Period** Ideally, seek companies with a PE of one visibility within a maximum of five to six years, as multi-decade plans are subject to various risks like competition, changes in consumer demand, technological disruptions, natural calamities, and regulatory changes [05:07:00].
*   **Company Size** A hidden PE of one might be more commonly found in mid-cap and small-cap companies rather than large-cap ones [05:19:00].

## Case Study: Alibaba Group Holdings Limited

Alibaba Group Holdings Limited, a Chinese company, is presented as an example that appears to have a hidden PE of one [05:56:00].

Despite facing significant headwinds in recent years, including an 80% drop in market valuations from its all-time high due to geopolitics, President Xi's re-election, China's COVID policy, and regulatory changes, Alibaba remains highly profitable and trades at exceptionally low valuations [06:03:00].

### Valuation Breakdown:
*   **Current Price** At the time of recording, one share of Alibaba traded at $65 [06:30:00].
*   **Net Cash Position** The company holds a net cash position of $70 billion, equivalent to approximately $10 per share [06:35:00].
*   **Cash-Adjusted Price** This brings the cash-adjusted share price to $55 [06:43:00].
*   **FY23 EPS Estimate** Consensus estimates projected an EPS of $7.11 for FY23 [06:47:00].
*   **Cash-Adjusted P/E (FY23)** Based on the cash-adjusted price and FY23 EPS, the P/E ratio was 7.7 [06:56:00].
*   **Projected FY28 EPS** The EPS is projected to grow to $14.29 per share over the next five years [07:01:00].
*   **Projected Cash-Adjusted P/E (FY28)** This projection results in a P/E ratio of 3.8 [07:05:00].

### Economic Earnings (Free Cash Flow)
A deeper examination considers "economic earnings," represented by free cash flow, rather than just "accounting earnings" (EPS) [07:33:00]. Alibaba's free cash flow numbers have consistently averaged 40% higher than its EPS numbers [07:52:00]. This discrepancy suggests a more robust earnings picture.

By reconstructing the FY28 EPS estimate with this higher free cash flow, a "hidden EPS" of $20 is derived [08:00:00]. Based on the current cash-adjusted price of $55, the hidden P/E for Alibaba comes to just 2.75, bringing it much closer to the PE of one target [08:08:00].

## Cautions and Considerations

While the concept of a hidden PE of one is powerful, it is an infrequent phenomenon [08:35:00]. Investors might be fortunate to find such a company only once every three or four years [08:42:00].

### Avoiding Pitfalls:
*   **Cyclical Businesses** Be cautious when analyzing cyclical businesses, as their P/E ratios are highly volatile, and their visibility beyond one or two years is limited [08:54:00]. In these cases, demand-supply gaps often determine the price more than earnings [09:09:00].
*   **Focus on Direct Parameters** When identifying PE of one stocks, prioritize direct parameters such as sales growth, profit growth, and operating margins. Companies with pricing power should also be given extra consideration [09:16:00].
*   **Turnaround Situations** Look for "turnaround" companiesâ€”those that were previously strong but are currently experiencing difficulties. With a small capital infusion and good talent, these companies might return to normalcy and fit the hidden PE of one profile, despite some inherent risk [09:25:00].

Ultimately, finding such companies often requires looking beyond standard stock screeners and keeping an eye out for businesses that have the potential to reach a future PE of one [09:43:00].

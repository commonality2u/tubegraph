Hybrid funds offer various strategies for managing investment risk, particularly when market conditions are uncertain. They typically combine different asset classes like equity and debt to achieve specific risk-return profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

## Conservative Hybrid Funds

Conservative hybrid funds are designed to have a significant allocation to debt, making them less volatile than pure equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
*   **Asset Allocation** These funds are mandated by regulations to invest 75% to 90% of their assets in debt instruments, with the remaining 10% to 25% allocated to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
*   **Returns** Historically, they have delivered returns ranging from 6% to 11%, with exceptions noted in years like 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   **Taxation** Capital gains from conservative hybrid funds are taxed as per the investor's marginal tax rate, which aligns with debt-oriented taxation. This makes them less appealing for investors in higher tax brackets, such as the 30% bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.
*   **Suitability** Due to their tax implications, these funds are generally not favored for parking short-term money compared to options like fixed deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

## Equity Savings Funds

Equity savings funds employ a hybrid investment strategy combining equity, debt, and [[arbitrage_funds_and_their_functionality | arbitrage]] in approximately equal proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Management** This mix provides decent downside protection against market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   **Returns** These funds can generate inflation-beating returns, with historical performance ranging from 4% to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.
*   **Taxation** They are treated as equity-oriented for taxation purposes, meaning Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) are taxed at 15% and Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Suitability** Equity savings funds are suitable for investors seeking some equity exposure while aiming to reduce overall risk, especially when market uncertainty is balanced (e.g., a 50% chance of market fall or rise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. They are considered a preferable option for parking short-term money due to their balanced approach and favorable taxation compared to conservative hybrid funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

## Dynamic Asset Allocation Funds (Balance Advantage Funds)

Also known as Balance Advantage Funds (BAFs), these are a popular category among hybrid mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.
*   **Investment Strategy** BAFs invest in a mix of equity and debt instruments, with their core strength lying in their ability to dynamically adjust their [[portfolio_asset_allocation_with_two_funds | portfolio allocation]] between equity and debt based on market valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
    *   When markets are undervalued, the fund increases its equity exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.
    *   When valuations are high, the preference shifts towards debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.
    *   This aims to provide optimal returns while taking acceptable [[risk_management_in_investing | risk]], informed by the fund management team's understanding of valuations using metrics like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and Price-to-Book (P/B) multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.
*   **Variations** Each fund house may have a distinct approach to evaluating markets, leading to variations in the proportion of equity and debt across different schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   **Taxation** The taxation depends on the fund's equity proportion. If the equity proportion consistently stays above 65% (which most BAFs aim for), capital gains are taxed on an equity basis; otherwise, they are taxed as non-equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   **Returns** The range of returns offered by BAFs can be quite sharp, typically sharper than conservative hybrid or equity savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   **Suitability** While equity savings funds are generally preferred for short-term parking, Balance Advantage Funds can be explored for long-term parking (e.g., 3 to 5 years) for moderately risk-tolerant or intolerant individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

## Transitioning Parked Money

When clarity on market direction emerges, money parked in hybrid funds can be systematically transferred into pure equity schemes using a Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. A common strategy involves placing source money in a debt or hybrid fund and then transferring it to a pure equity fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. Using an equity savings fund as the source for an STP into a pure equity fund can be advantageous because a significant portion (around 65%) is non-equity, and it offers equity taxation on capital gains, potentially leading to better post-tax returns even in volatile equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

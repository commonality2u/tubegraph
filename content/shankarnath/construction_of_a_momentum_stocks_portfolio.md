Traditionally, fund managers are often associated with a specific investment style, such as value or growth investing, and many find it challenging to shift between these approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While strong education in areas like value investing can be incredibly helpful, it can also create an "invisible boundary" that prevents exploration of other concepts like technical analysis or algorithmic trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. One area that has gained significant traction is [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## What is Momentum Investing?

In an investment context, momentum refers to the tendency for investments that have performed well to continue doing well, and similarly, for stocks that have performed poorly to continue performing poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This is a counter-intuitive concept for those steeped in value investing, where the idea of investing in a stock that has already appreciated significantly (e.g., 50-60%) might seem "sacrilegious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## History and Behavioral Explanation

The study of momentum as an [[momentum_investing_strategy | investment strategy]] began around the 1990s, with researchers like Fama and French observing that momentum often delivered higher returns than market-cap or value-style funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. One explanation for this anomaly comes from behavioral finance, which suggests that investors tend to overreact or underreact to information, causing stock prices to shoot up or be depressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These distortions tend to reduce over the long term, which is why momentum investing is often considered a short-term strategy, typically played out over a 3 to 6-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Simple Momentum Portfolio Construction

A portfolio of momentum stocks can be constructed with minimal investment knowledge, primarily requiring a standard screening software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Here are the basic steps:

1.  **Define the Universe**: Start by defining the universe of stocks, for example, by applying a market cap range. For mid-caps, this could be 25 to 75,000 crores, yielding approximately 155 stocks across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
2.  **Sort by Return**: Sort these stocks in descending order based on their share price return over a recent period, such as the past 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
3.  **Pick Top Stocks**: Select the top-performing stocks from this sorted list, for example, the top 10 stocks, which will form your momentum portfolio for the next 3 to 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Performance Analysis

A real-life test of this strategy, using data from August of a previous year, showed that a 10-stock momentum portfolio generated a 34% point-to-point return over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This significantly outperformed the Nifty 50 and Midcap 150, which returned 11% and 26% respectively during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Analyzing the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index provides further insights into [[performance_analysis_of_momentum_indices | momentum performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>:
*   The index generally outperformed the Nifty in most years, with particularly strong years in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2021, and 2023 (delivering 23% returns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   However, momentum can perform poorly in certain years, notably in 2018 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Momentum funds tend to accelerate returns during market rallies (bullish periods) but struggle and can deliver negative returns when markets are flat or bearish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Hedge funds often employ momentum in both directions, buying when momentum is positive and shorting when it turns negative, aiming to profit in both scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## How to Participate in Momentum Investing

Investors can participate in the [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum investing]] opportunity through various instruments:

### Indices
In India, key momentum indices include:
*   **Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index**: Composed mostly of large-cap stocks (70-75%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index**: Entirely composed of mid-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Both indices have shown strong performance, with 5-year Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) of 23% and 32% respectively, compared to the Nifty 50's 16% over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For example, ₹1 lakh invested in the Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index in January 2019 would have grown to over ₹4 lakh, almost double the Nifty 50's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Mutual Funds and ETFs
Mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are available for both indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. When choosing an index fund, consider:
*   Brand preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>
*   Expense ratio (should not be too high or too low) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
*   Assets Under Management (AUM), which ideally should be above ₹100 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Active Offerings
In addition to passively managed funds, there are active offerings like the Samco Active Momentum Fund and the Quant AMC Momentum Fund, which operate based on proprietary models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Smallcases and PMS Offerings
Numerous smallcases are built around different [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Providers like Right Research, Capital Mind, Weekend Investing, and Windmill Capital offer various methodologies, fee structures, and performance metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Different Momentum Strategies

Beyond basic price momentum, various advanced strategies exist:

*   **Price Momentum**: Investing in stocks that have shown strong recent price performance, assuming continuation of the upward trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Relative Strength Momentum**: Comparing an asset's performance against its benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectional Momentum**: Comparing price movements of two stocks within the same sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Time Series Momentum (Trend Following)**: A technique focusing on an asset's past performance to predict its future trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Moving Average Momentum**: Used by traders and investors, based on moving averages to identify trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **52-Week High Momentum**: A popular strategy revolving around the idea that stocks at or near their 52-week highs will continue to perform well in the short run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Stock selection involves identifying 52-week high stocks and applying positive momentum factors like trading volumes, favorable news, or positive earning surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **[[momentum_and_value_investing | Combination of Momentum and Value]]**: This strategy plays on the weak correlation between the momentum and value factors in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. An equal 50/50 allocation can potentially achieve around 15% per annum on a 3, 5, 7, or 10-year rolling basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Dual Momentum**: Introduced by Gary Antonacci, this strategy involves two types of momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>:
    1.  **Absolute Momentum**: Compares a stock's recent price performance to its own historical performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    2.  **Relative Momentum**: Compares the stock's performance to a broader benchmark like a sector or index (e.g., Nifty 50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    These two scores are combined using a suitable weight (e.g., 50% each) to derive a dual momentum score, which is then used to rank and select stocks for the portfolio, followed by timely rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Samco's momentum fund reportedly utilizes dual momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## Conclusion
Momentum as a strategy is poised to remain relevant, continuing to capitalize on market trends and yield significant returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. It is recommended to explore and potentially incorporate a momentum portion into one's investment portfolio, perhaps aiming for 12-15% allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

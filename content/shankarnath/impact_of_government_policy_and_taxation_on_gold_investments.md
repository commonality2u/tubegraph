Government policies and taxation rules significantly influence the landscape of [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold investments]], impacting their attractiveness and viability for investors. Recent changes in India regarding import duties and the government's stance on Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) highlight this dynamic.

## Shifting Stance on Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)

Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) were once a popular tool for the Government of India to raise funds, having accumulated over 70,000 crores since 2015 through 67 tranches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, the government's interest in SGBs has waned. The last issuance occurred in February of the current year, with no subsequent issues in the present financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This shift is primarily because SGBs have proven to be "one of the most expensive borrowing tool for the government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

To further deter consumer reliance on SGBs, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already announced premature redemption for 30 SGB tranches that were issued between May 2017 and March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This clearly indicates that the Government of India and the Ministry of Finance are "not interested in sovereign gold bonds anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This disinterest is mirrored by the Indian consumer, particularly after changes in import duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Impact of Lowered Gold Import Duty

A significant policy change impacting [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | gold investments]] was the government's decision to lower the import duty on gold from 15% to 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This reduction made other forms of gold, including physical gold, digital gold, [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | Gold ETFs]], and gold mutual funds, "a lot more attractive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This reduction in customs duty is believed to be a catalyst behind the recent surge in interest in [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | Gold ETFs]], with over 1,300 crores invested in July alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## Taxation of Gold Investments

The [[risks_and_returns_associated_with_different_gold_investment_options | value of gold]] for ETFs is determined based on the price set by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which serves as the global benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This price is then converted into Indian rupees by adding the cost of transportation from London to India, along with "notional customs duties, taxes, and any additional levies associated with importing gold into the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

For [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | Gold ETFs]], the total expense ratio (TER) covers charges related to transport, storage, handling, and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The SEBI has set an upper limit of 1% for the total expense ratio of [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | Gold ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. In addition to the expense ratio, investors may incur other costs for ETFs such as demat charges, AMC charges, brokerage, and exchange transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

Recent budget announcements have also brought about changes in tax rules for gold investments. Notably, the holding period has been reduced, and in certain scenarios, the tax rate has seen some relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Due to the complexities of taxation, it is recommended to consult a tax advisor to fully optimize this aspect of gold investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. These tax changes, combined with the drop in customs duty and the approaching festive season, suggest an opportune time for certain gold investment products like the Grow Gold ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

The [[garp_investing_strategy | Growth at Reasonable Price (GARP) investing strategy]] combines elements of both value and growth investing, aiming to identify companies with strong growth potential that are trading at a reasonable valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. This approach was popularized by investor Peter Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>. The core idea behind [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP]] is not to find cheap companies, but rather to find companies whose growth is being underpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This article explores various frameworks and [[key_metrics_in_garp_investing | key metrics]] used to implement a [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP strategy]], including several screeners that have shown significant one-year returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

## Foundations of GARP Investing

The [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP]] style sits between traditional value investing (looking for companies below intrinsic value) and growth investing (focusing on companies delivering above-average growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Growth Measurement

Growth is a foundational component of the [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP investing framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth**: Investing in companies that have grown their EPS at an accelerated pace historically has not always worked well, as a company's growth rate can change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. EPS growth can be unpredictable and subject to manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue Growth**: Prioritizing revenue growth is often more sustainable and correlated over time compared to EPS growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### The PEG Ratio

A crucial metric in [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP investing]], popularized by Peter Lynch, is the Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Calculation**: The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing a company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio by its EPS growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Interpretation**:
    *   **In Isolation**: A PEG ratio of less than one suggests the business might be undervalued based on its earnings forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Peter Lynch considered a PEG ratio of one as the definition of a fairly valued business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Relative Basis**: Comparing the PEG ratios of different stocks can facilitate easier comparisons between companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Modern Interpretation**: Given the current low-interest rate environment, modern [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP]] investors may consider a stock attractive if its PEG ratio is two or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Caveats**: When examining the P/E ratio, account for cyclicity, and when using EPS, prioritize future growth over historical growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

### Additional Parameters for Fortification

Beyond growth and the PEG ratio, a [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP strategy]] can be fortified with additional parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>:
*   **Debt Ratio**: Total liabilities divided by total assets should ideally not exceed 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Moats**: The business should possess one or more powerful economic moats to ensure sustainability and protect profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Promoter Shareholding**: High promoter shareholding is often seen as a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Circle of Competence**: Investors should be clear about the types of businesses they want to explore or avoid based on their own preferences and [[adapting_peter_lynchs_approach_to_different_markets | circle of competence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

## Diverse GARP Strategy Implementations

Since there is no single defined [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP investing strategy]], several variations can be explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

### 1. Ainvest.com Simple Screener

This approach utilizes three key variables:
*   **Market Capitalization**: Adjusted to a maximum of 10,000 crores for an Indian environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
*   **PEG Ratio**: Between 0 and 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   **EPS Growth Rate**: Set at a minimum of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

When backtested as an academic exercise (using historical 3-year P/E and EPS growth), a portfolio of 83 stocks identified by this method delivered a one-year return of 113% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. None of the 83 stocks showed negative returns over that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

### 2. Ishmohit's GARP Framework

This framework, initially focused on large-cap businesses (market cap above 50,000 crores), includes:
*   **Market Capitalization**: For exploration, variations like 20,000-50,000 crores for mid-caps or below 20,000 crores for [[small_cap_and_micro_cap_strategies | small caps]] are encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.
*   **Year-on-Year Quarterly Sales Growth**: Minimum 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.
*   **Year-on-Year Quarterly Profit Growth**: Minimum 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **P/E Multiple**: Less than 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

Notably, this methodology does not explicitly use the PEG ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. When applied to companies with a market cap over 10,000 crores, 62% of the resulting stocks had a PEG ratio between 0 and 1, and an additional 21% had a PEG ratio between 1 and 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. This framework delivered a 110% return over the last one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

### 3. Economic Times Six-Point Criteria

Based on an article, this [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP]] selection uses:
*   **Market Cap**: Over 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Revenue**: Over 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.
*   **5-Year Profit Growth**: At least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
*   **Expected Future Profit Growth**: 15% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   **PEG Ratio**: Less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.
*   **Analyst Coverage**: Minimum of five analysts covering the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

A small portfolio based on the Economic Times framework yielded an annual return of 51% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

### 4. S&P 500 GARP Index Methodology

This documented strategy, used by the S&P 500 [[growth_at_reasonable_price_garp_metrics | GARP]] Index, focuses on five factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>:
*   **Growth Variables**:
    *   Three-year EPS growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.
    *   Three-year Sales Per Share (SPS) growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.
*   **Quality and Value Composite Factors**:
    *   **Financial Leverage Ratio**: Total debt divided by the company's book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Return on Equity (ROE)**: 12-month trailing EPS divided by book value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Earnings to Price Ratio**: 12-month trailing EPS divided by the stock's current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

## Custom GARP Framework

A personal [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP investing framework]] can be designed with the following criteria:
*   **Market Capitalization**: Nothing below 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.
*   **Minimum Sales**: At least 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>.
*   **PEG Ratio**: Between 0 and 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.
*   **Sales CAGR**: 1, 3, and 5-year sales CAGR of at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   **EPS CAGR**: 1, 3, and 5-year EPS CAGR of 15% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>.
*   **Expected Profits**: Next quarter's earnings higher than the last year's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

This custom [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP]] portfolio of 27 companies would have delivered 115% in returns over the last one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. The companies in this list generally showed high sales and profit growth, a wide spread in sectors, Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) mostly in the 15-25% range, average promoter holding around 55%, and an interest coverage ratio comfortably above three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the objective of [[garp_investing_strategy | GARP]] is not to find cheap companies but to identify companies whose growth has been underpriced, always maintaining a long-term perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>.

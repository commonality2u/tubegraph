The [[dividend_discount_model | Dividend Discount Model]] (DDM) is a framework used to calculate the [[developing_a_model_for_investment_returns | intrinsic value]] of a company's stock based on its expected future [[impact_of_dividends_on_total_returns | dividends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Key Inputs

To use the [[dividend_discount_model | DDM]], an investor requires three main inputs:
1.  **Current Dividend Per Share** This value forms the numerator in the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
2.  **Discount Rate** This rate, which is in the denominator, has been discussed in relation to [[discounted_cash_flow_method | DCF]] calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
3.  **Dividend Growth Rate** This rate is subtracted from the discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

## Calculation Example (Infosys)

For Infosys, an example calculation using the [[dividend_discount_model | DDM]] is provided:
*   **Current Dividend:** Infosys paid a dividend of 32.50 rupees per share for FY23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This is the numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Discount Rate:** Using a 12% discount rate, consistent with previous calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
*   **Dividend Growth Rate:** An 8% growth rate is assumed, as the company's profits are increasing by roughly 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

Applying these figures:
*   Intrinsic Value = Current Dividend / (Discount Rate - Dividend Growth Rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>
*   Intrinsic Value = 32.5 / (0.12 - 0.08) = 32.5 / 0.04 = 812 rupees per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

Based on this [[dividend_discount_model | DDM]] calculation, the [[developing_a_model_for_investment_returns | intrinsic value]] of Infosys is 812 rupees per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. When compared to the market price of 1,424 rupees per share at the time of recording, the Infosys stock appears significantly overpriced according to this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

## Limitations

The [[dividend_discount_model | DDM]] requires estimations and a number of assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. It is generally not considered a feasible strategy for growth stocks that pay little to no [[impact_of_dividends_on_total_returns | dividend]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The speaker personally states they are "not a fan of this approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

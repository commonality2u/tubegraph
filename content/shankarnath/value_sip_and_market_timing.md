A [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | Systematic Investment Plan]] (SIP) is a popular and effective investment strategy that helps investors navigate market fluctuations by averaging performance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. While traditional SIPs involve investing a fixed amount regularly, newer strategies, often called "Value SIPs," aim to enhance returns by incorporating market conditions into investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Evolution of SIPs: Beyond the Fixed Amount

Traditional SIPs have a perceived "fatal flaw" in that they do not account for additional market information, such as significant drops in market indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This has led to the development of enhanced SIP strategies that integrate market timing.

### Introducing Value SIPs

Value SIPs, also known by various names such as Alpha SIP, Smart SIP, Flex SIP, or Booster SIP, operate on the core principle of investing more when markets are undervalued and paring down investments when markets are expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. These strategies typically rely on models or algorithms to guide investment actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Step-Up SIP Strategy

A common enhancement is the [[step_up_sip_strategy | step-up SIP]], an accelerating plan where investors gradually increase their SIP amount over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
There are two main methods for stepping up:
*   **Absolute Amount Method**: Increasing the monthly contribution by a fixed amount (e.g., 2,000 rupees) each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Percentage Method**: Raising the SIP by a certain percentage (e.g., 10%) annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

While not complex, a step-up SIP is generally recommended as a beneficial strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Commercial Value SIP Products

Several financial institutions offer their versions of smart or value SIPs, designed to optimize returns by reacting to market conditions:

*   **ICICI Prudential Booster SIP**: This product adds two layers over a traditional SIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    1.  **Proprietary Equity Valuation Index (EVI) Model**: Informs the SIP when equities are cheap or expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    2.  **Variable Amount Setup**: Transfers an amount ranging from 10% to 1,000% of the base SIP, depending on the EVI model's signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. For example, if equities are super cheap and the base SIP is 10,000 rupees, the fund can invest up to 100,000 rupees (10 times the base SIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Conversely, if equities are super expensive, the investment may be pruned to just 1,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
    This booster SIP uses a source fund (e.g., short-duration debt fund) and a target fund (equity or hybrid fund) where the EVI model is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. ICICI Prudential's backtesting over a 17-year period showed a 1-2% lift in CAGR when applying this strategy to Nifty 50, Midcap 150, and Smallcap 250 indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

*   **Kotak Mutual Fund Smart SIP**: Similar to ICICI's offering, the monthly SIP amount is determined by Kotak's Baff net Equity allocation model, which classifies the market as cheap, neutral, or expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. While Kotak provides default min/max values (50% and 200% of the SIP amount), investors can modify these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The key difference from ICICI is that Kotak directly changes the SIP amount itself, rather than using a source/target fund concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

*   **Other offerings**: HDFC Mutual Fund offers a Flex SIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, RankMF.com has a Smart SIP that can buy, sell, and even skip installments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, and php.com provides an Alpha SIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

While these functionalities add intelligence to SIPs, they introduce an element of [[importance_of_timing_and_market_conditions_in_investment_decisions | market timing]], which contrasts with the classical premise of SIPs to invest irrespective of market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Nonetheless, investing is an evolutionary process, and staying open to new learning is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## [[DIY SIP strategies and market valuation | DIY Value SIP Strategies]]

It is possible to implement smart SIP strategies independently, without relying on commercial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Two DIY strategies discussed are based on relative valuation and market valuation using the P/E ratio.

### Strategy 1: Relative Valuation

This strategy involves comparing the relative valuation of different market indices.
*   **Methodology**: Monthly closing values of the Nifty Smallcap 250 TR and Nifty 50 TR indices were used, recomputed based on a 2007 base value to derive a relative score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Performance**: This strategy was shown to visibly improve returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. A follow-up attempt with the Nifty Midcap 150 index yielded less conclusive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Taxation**: Post-tax analysis confirmed that this relative valuation SIP strategy generated good alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Strategy 2: Market Valuation (P/E Ratio)

This strategy specifically uses the P/E ratio as the primary basis for investment decisions, reflecting the core logic of many smart SIP models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

*   **Baseline Performance**: A regular 10,000 rupees monthly SIP in the Nifty 50 TR index from January 2007 to December 2022 (16 years) yielded a CAGR of exactly 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This 13% is the target to beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

*   **P/E Ratio Bands**: The strategy creates bands for the Nifty P/E ratio to classify market conditions:
    *   **Normal**: P/E ratio between 18 and 24 (aligns with Nifty's long-term average of around 21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. In this range, the standard 10,000 rupee SIP continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Cheap/Super Cheap**: Below 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
    *   **Expensive/Super Expensive**: Above 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

*   **Investment Actions**: When the P/E ratio falls outside the normal band, different buy and sell actions are activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This involves adding more units when the market seems undervalued and redeeming units when overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

*   **Scenarios Tested (10,000 rupees base SIP)**:
    1.  **Base Scenario**: Fixed 10,000 rupees invested every month, irrespective of P/E ratio. Result: 13% CAGR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
    2.  **Selective Investment**: Invest 10,000 rupees only when P/E ratio is 22 or lower, holding SIP when Nifty is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    3.  **Accelerated Buying**: Invest in all P/E bands, but significantly increase investment when P/E ratio falls below 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. For example, an additional 10,000 rupees if P/E is 16-18, and even more at lower P/E levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    4.  **Buy/Sell Based on P/E**: Invest 10,000 rupees when P/E is 22 or less. If P/E goes above 22, redeem 10,000 rupees worth of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
    5.  **Accelerated Buy/Sell**: Employ an accelerated buying and selling structure across different P/E bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. For instance, committing 50,000 rupees when P/E is very cheap (e.g., 11) and withdrawing 40,000 rupees when P/E is super expensive (e.g., 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

*   **Results**: All four intelligent scenarios (2, 3, 4, and 5) outperformed the 13% base case, supporting the argument that adding an intelligence layer to an SIP can significantly improve returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

### DIY Implementation Steps

Implementing a [[customizing_sip_plus_lumpsum_strategies | DIY smart SIP]] using the P/E ratio strategy is feasible:
1.  **Monthly Reminder**: Set a reminder to check the Nifty P/E ratio and prompt investment/redemption action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
2.  **Check P/E Ratio**: Access Niftyindices.com to find the previous month's closing P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
3.  **Determine Action**: Refer to your pre-defined P/E ratio bands table to decide the required action (buy, sell, or hold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
4.  **Execute Trade**: Log into your trading account and buy or sell the calculated number of Nifty ETF units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

This entire process is estimated to take only about 6 minutes per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The potential gain of 1-2% higher CAGR over the long run makes this minimal effort worthwhile, effectively achieving "direct plan" like returns from your SIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Investors are encouraged to try this approach, even with a small amount like 1,000 rupees per month, to see how it performs in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

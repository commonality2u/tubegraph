The [[relative_strength_index_introduction_and_history | Relative Strength Index (RSI)]] and stock price generally move in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. However, there are instances where the stock price and its [[relative_strength_index_introduction_and_history | RSI]] do not move in sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This phenomenon is known as **RSI Divergence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Essentially, divergence indicates a difference in opinion or interest between the price movement and the [[relative_strength_index_introduction_and_history | RSI]], as they move in opposite directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Types of RSI Divergence

RSI Divergence can be categorized into two main types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>:

### Bearish Divergence

This occurs when the stock price moves upwards, but the [[relative_strength_index_introduction_and_history | RSI]] moves downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. It is called a bearish divergence because if the stock price is losing its underlying strength (as indicated by the declining [[relative_strength_index_introduction_and_history | RSI]]), it is likely that the price will eventually follow suit and begin to move downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

*   **Example:** From March 13, 2019, until May 3, the Reliance Industries chart showed a bearish divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. During this period, the stock price moved up, while its [[relative_strength_index_introduction_and_history | RSI]] moved in the opposite direction (downwards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This indicated that the price was in a weakening stage, and it eventually came down after May 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Bullish Divergence

Conversely, a bullish RSI Divergence happens when the stock price is going down, but the [[relative_strength_index_introduction_and_history | RSI]] is simultaneously going up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This suggests that while the price is declining, the underlying strength of the stock is gaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, which often precedes an upward movement in price.

*   **Example:** Reliance Industries, from November 23, 2021, until December 20, experienced a bullish divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. During this time, the price was declining, but the [[relative_strength_index_introduction_and_c_history | RSI]] was gaining strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, leading to an eventual upward price movement after December 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

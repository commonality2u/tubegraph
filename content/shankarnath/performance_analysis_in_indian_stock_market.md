The **trending value strategy** is an investment approach that has demonstrated significant outperformance against broader market indices over extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Initially detailed by James O'Shaughnessy in his book *What Works on Wall Street*, this strategy combines principles of momentum and value investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Historical Performance (Global Context)

Over a 45-year period from January 1964 to December 2009, the trending value strategy yielded an annualized return of 21.19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This means an initial investment of $10,000 would have grown to over $69 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In comparison, the market index compounded at 11.2% over the same 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Comparing the individual components:
*   **Value Investing:** Buying undervalued stocks using a "value composite 2 indicator" delivered an annualized return of 17.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Momentum Investing:** Buying stocks with the best six-month price appreciation yielded 14.5% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Combined Trending Value Strategy:** This combination achieved an average yearly return of 21.2% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | technofundamental portfolio]] not only outperforms the index but also individual single-factor strategies, with the added benefit of lower volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Constructing the Trending Value Strategy

The strategy involves two main components: a value score and a momentum score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### 1. Value Score Calculation

The value score is derived from six financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>:
*   **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Multiple:** Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Price-to-Book Value (P/B):** Lower is better, especially for capital-intensive businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Price-to-Cash Flow from Operations (P/CF):** Indicates how the market values a company's cash flow generation; lower is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Price-to-Sales (P/S):** O'Shaughnessy's preferred metric; lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **EV to EBITDA (Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** Assesses overall company value (market cap + debt in relation to earnings); lower is typically better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Dividend Yield:** Companies offering a higher dividend relative to share price are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. (Note: Shareholder yield may be used in later editions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

**Process for Value Score:**
1.  **Define Universe:** Select companies, for example, those with a market capitalization of at least 500 crores in the Indian market (yielding over 1,500 companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
2.  **Collect Data:** Gather the six metric values for each company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
3.  **Download Data:** Export information to a worksheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
4.  **Allocate Deciles:** Rank all companies for each variable and assign a score based on their decile (e.g., rank 1-150 for 1500 companies is the first decile, assigned 1 point; higher deciles receive higher points, indicating more expensive valuation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
5.  **Repeat for All Variables:** Apply this decile scoring across all six metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
6.  **Cumulative Score:** Sum the decile scores for all six metrics to get a total value composite score for each company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Lower cumulative scores indicate more undervalued companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### 2. Momentum Score Calculation

The momentum score identifies companies with strong stock price performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
1.  **Reduce Universe:** Filter the initial universe to only include companies in the top decile based on their combined value scores (e.g., the top 150 companies for 1500 total) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
2.  **Six-Month Price Return:** Obtain the six-month price return for each stock in this reduced universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
3.  **Select Top Stocks:** Sort these stocks by six-month price return in descending order and select the top 25 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. These 25 stocks form the trending value portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. O'Shaughnessy found 25 stocks yielded the highest risk-adjusted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
4.  **Rebalancing:** The portfolio is rebalanced annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## [[performance_analysis_of_indian_index_funds | Performance analysis in Indian Stock Market]]

A study by Capitalmind backtested the trending value strategy on Indian stocks over a 16-year period (2007-2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Key Findings in India
*   **Market Capitalization:** Approximately 79% of the trades involved companies ranked between 500 and 1,500 in terms of market capitalization, indicating that the trending value strategy is primarily a [[performance_and_execution_of_investments_in_small_and_mid_cap_stocks | small cap strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Micro caps were identified as the biggest winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Returns:** The Capitalmind study reported a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.6% over the 16-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. In contrast, the Nifty50 yielded only 9.9% during the same time frame, demonstrating a 10% alpha (outperformance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Volatility and Drawdowns:** Unlike O'Shaughnessy's global findings, the Indian study revealed that the strategy led to higher volatility and drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This is attributed to the strategy's preference for [[performance_and_execution_of_investments_in_small_and_mid_cap_stocks | small and micro caps]], which inherently exhibit greater volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Rolling Returns:** Rolling returns over a 10-year period consistently showed the strategy outperforming the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Observations and Considerations for Implementation in India

*   **Market Cycles:** The strategy's performance is closely tied to small and micro cap market cycles, which typically offer high returns but are extremely volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Value Predominance:** Portfolios derived from this strategy tend to be dominated by value stocks (e.g., P/E ratio less than 12, annual sales greater than market capitalization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Lumpy Returns:** Returns can be lumpy, with periods of muted performance followed by sudden spikes, particularly during shifts towards value stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Risk Profile:** The trending value strategy is considered a high-risk, high-reward approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. It requires a high tolerance for volatility and may not suit investors primarily focused on growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

> [!INFO] Summary
> The trending value strategy, while effective globally, operates as a high-risk, high-reward [[performance_and_execution_of_investments_in_small_and_mid_cap_stocks | small and micro-cap strategy]] in the Indian context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. It combines undervalued companies with strong price momentum to generate significant alpha, but investors must be prepared for higher volatility and drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

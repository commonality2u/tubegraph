When equity markets are at all-time highs, it's a good time to consider selling off certain holdings to maximize gains, reduce portfolio risk, and preserve capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. One strategy involves distinguishing between high and low conviction investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Defining Conviction

The concept of conviction in investing refers to the level of confidence an investor has in a particular asset based on their due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### High Conviction Bets
High conviction bets are investments where significant homework, research, and analysis have been conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For these investments, the original investment thesis continues to hold true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Low Conviction Bets
Conversely, low conviction bets are characterized by a lack of effort in understanding the underlying business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. These stocks might have been acquired by simply "riding the bull market wave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, or worse, based on tips, or recommendations from "bigname investor[s] or some guy on Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Strategy for Market Highs

When contemplating sales, it is advisable to sell low conviction bets before high conviction ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. If an investor has been fortunate with such stocks, an all-time high market presents an opportunity to sell these low conviction ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, allowing them to retain instruments where they have better knowledge and conviction in the business and fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Selling Weaker Stocks and Loss-Making Positions
An all-time high market is an excellent opportunity to divest from weaker stocks and even loss-making positions within a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. While investors don't intentionally buy stocks that are expected to underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, long-term equity portfolios often accumulate "dud stocks," particularly in the midcap and [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap]] segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Since a rising tide lifts all boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, even these weaker assets may have seen price appreciation. This moment should be leveraged to sell fundamentally weak companies or those whose earning cycles have begun to trend downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Tax Loss Harvesting
Even if booking losses on these weaker positions, the government offers a benefit through [[fixed_income_investment_options_for_retail_investors | tax loss harvesting]] rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. These rules allow investors to offset some losses against capital gains, leading to tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Therefore, an all-time high market is a valuable time to correct past investment mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

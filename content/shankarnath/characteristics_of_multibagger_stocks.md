Over a nine-year period, coinciding with the Narendra Modi government's tenure, the Indian stock market has experienced significant growth, with market capitalization tripling from $1.2 trillion to $3.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The Economic Times identified 44 stocks that delivered over 1000% returns during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. A study of these "Superstar stocks" aimed to identify the reasons for their success to improve future [[Investment Strategies for Multibagger Stocks | investing decisions]] and potentially identify future multibaggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

This analysis draws upon various [[Investment Strategies for Multibagger Stocks | investing strategies]] previously explored, such as coffee can investing, Peter Lynch's framework, the magic formula, and [[Ambit Capitals 10 Bagger Portfolio Framework | Ambit Capital's 10 bagger framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Key Financial Metrics

Several variables are crucial for identifying high-growth potential companies:

### Sales Growth
A bare minimum of 10% sales growth over the last 10 years is desirable, with Superstar stocks averaging almost 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. However, it's important to note that a company's sales journey is rarely linear, with many ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Growth must be consistent rather than sporadic, as seen in companies like Electra Green Tech, whose significant growth was concentrated in the last two or three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
Additionally, sales figures are a product of volume and average sales value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Understanding whether sales growth is driven by increased volume or simply price hikes (e.g., FMCG industry's value growth despite volume degrowth due to price increases) is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth
Growth in EPS has a direct correlation with an increase in a company's share price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Data from over 600 companies shows that a 15.1% EPS growth over 10 years correlated with an average share price appreciation of nearly 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. For Superstar companies, no company achieved a [[Concept of 100 Bagger Stocks | 10 bagger]] status with an EPS growth of less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The ideal range for EPS growth is 20% to 25% for long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
ROCE is a popular metric favored by various [[Investment Strategies for Multibagger Stocks | investing strategies]] including Robert Kirby's coffee can investing (recommending at least 15%), Saurabh Mukherjee, and the Massless team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The Superstar stocks averaged 23.1% ROCE, with most exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Top performers have demonstrated an ability to increase their ROCE over many years, indicating higher profits relative to invested capital and a strengthening competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. High ROCE offers investors a better chance of achieving 10, 20, or 30 bagger returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### PEG Ratio
Created by Peter Lynch, the PEG ratio divides a company's P/E ratio by its expected EPS growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. According to Lynch, stocks with a PEG ratio greater than one are overvalued, while those less than one are undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. While a dynamic number, eight Superstar stocks were found to have a PEG ratio less than one based on current data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The median PEG ratio for Nifty 500 companies is 1.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, suggesting that Superstar companies with a PEG ratio of 1.4 or less warrant deeper investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Capital Employed Turnover Ratio
This metric, highlighted in [[Ambit Capitals 10 Bagger Portfolio Framework | Ambit's 10 Bagger framework]], indicates how effectively a company utilizes its fixed assets to generate sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. A higher ratio is generally better, but it is industry-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. While only about half of the Superstar companies had a ratio above their industry average, stocks that delivered over 4000% returns consistently showed a significantly higher capital employed turnover ratio than their industry benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)
Increasing cash flow from operations is vital because it allows a company to cover operational expenses, reduces reliance on external financing or debt, enables investment in R&D and market expansion, and provides benefits to shareholders through dividends or buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Many Superstar companies, such as SRF, Balaji Amines, Astral, and Tata Elxsi, have demonstrated consistent CFO growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Consistent and increasing CFO is considered the lifeblood of an organization, paving the way for multibagger returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Forensic Analysis (Accounting Checks)

[[Methodology for identifying undervalued and high momentum stocks | Forensic analysis]] helps assess the cleanliness and reliability of a company's financial reporting.

### Cash Flow from Operations as a Percentage of EBITDA
This metric helps determine if reported earnings are genuinely translating into actual cash receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Significant deviations could signal financial mismanagement or fraudulent activity, particularly when aggressive revenue recognition policies artificially inflate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Companies with a high value for this metric are generally preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. While the average for Superstar stocks (excluding financial companies) was 67%, this analysis is best done on a relative basisâ€”over time and compared to industry peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Contingent Liabilities as a Percentage of Net Worth
Contingent liabilities represent potential future obligations that depend on the outcome of uncertain events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. If this number exceeds 20%, it warrants concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. For most Superstar stocks, this metric is in the lower single digits (less than 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. However, a handful of companies have this number at 20% or higher, indicating a significant risk to their financial health if the liability materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Robustness (Fragility Scorecard)

The fragility scorecard assesses a company's financial strength based on four metrics:
1.  **Equity as a percentage of Total Liabilities**: A high percentage indicates robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
2.  **Break-Even Sales as a percentage of Actual Sales**: Ideally, this number should be low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
3.  **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)**: Higher ROCE is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
4.  **Cash Flows from Operations as a multiple of Annual Debt Obligations plus Replacement Capex**: This multiple should be high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

Most Superstar companies were found to be robust, with a median Equity as a percentage of total liabilities at 63%, break-even sales at 22%, median ROCE at nearly 23%, and a CFO multiplier of 1.6 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. However, exceptions exist, such as Trent, which despite a strong share price performance, showed significant issues across all four fragility parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Assessing a company's robustness or fragility should be part of an [[Investment Strategies for Multibagger Stocks | investment checklist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

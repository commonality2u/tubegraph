During Dhanteras, a significant and unusual shift occurred in the demand for precious metals, with silver sales surpassing gold for the first time ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Dhanteras, celebrated on the 13th day of Krishna Paka in the month of Kartika, marks the beginning of Diwali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The word "Dhan" means wealth, and "teras" means the 13th day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Hindus worldwide traditionally observe this day by purchasing precious metals, particularly gold, to invite good fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Unusual Shift in Demand

While gold sales during Dhanteras were approximately 15% lower than the previous year, the demand for silver surged by 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This had not been observed before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Contributing Factors

Several factors are believed to have contributed to this unprecedented surge in silver demand:
*   **Gold Price Increase** The 28% rise in gold prices played a part in dampening its demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Silver's Perceived Value** Despite silver's price rising by an even higher 36% in the past year, there was a sudden interest in the metal often described as "Poor Man's Gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Optimistic Market Outlook** There's a general sense of optimism regarding silver's future. For instance, Keith Neumeyer predicts silver could reach $100 an ounce or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Motilal Oswal Financial Services also predicts silver prices to rise by another 28% by the end of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Drivers of Silver's Value

The underlying drivers of silver's value are crucial to understanding this increased interest:
*   **Demand and Supply** For the past four years, mining output has not kept pace with requirements, leading to an uptrend in silver prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Currently, there is the biggest supply deficit in the history of the silver market, a point highlighted by Mr. Anil Agarwal of Vedanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This deficit is expected to tighten further in 2025 as production struggles to meet industrial demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Industrial Output** Silver's demand is largely industrial, finding its way into mobile phones, laptops, space exploration, and [[Uses and Industrial Applications of Silver | renewable energy solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Electric vehicles (EVs) use twice the amount of silver compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, and demand in this sector is set to soar with the EV market's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Silver is also a vital component in solar panels, with a typical 3x5 foot panel containing up to 20 grams of silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. India imported over 4,000 metric tons of silver between January and April 2024, exceeding the 3,600 metric tons imported in all of 2023, largely due to the rise of solar cell and module manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Inflation** The price of silver generally shows an upward trend during periods of increased inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Silver is often considered a hedge against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Geopolitics** Global events create reasons for investors to hold assets in safer havens like precious metals, including silver, gold, platinum, and palladium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Purchases** Traditionally, central banks have bought gold, but the Central Bank of the Russian Federation announced plans to purchase silver as part of its reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This move could significantly increase silver prices if other central banks follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Gold-Silver Ratio** The gold-silver ratio (gold price divided by silver price) is used by precious metals traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. At the time of recording, the ratio was 82.5 (8174 rupees for 1 gram of gold vs. 99 rupees for 1 gram of silver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Historically, a high ratio (like 82.5 compared to a long-term average of around 60) suggests that silver might be undervalued and gold overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. High ratios often coincide with crises like conflicts, pandemics, or stock market bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Silver's Performance as an Asset

[[Performance analysis in Indian stock market | Silver]] has been a volatile commodity over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>:
*   **1990s - 2004**: Period of stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Next 6 years**: Acceleration, with prices rising by about 600% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Post-acceleration**: Decline, with prices crashing by 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Since March 2020**: Period of growth, delivering a CAGR of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Silver, similar to gold, has provided strong protection during crises, often outperforming equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. It shows a moderately strong positive correlation with gold, meaning they often move in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Its correlation with equities is weak and can turn negative during economic downturns, making it attractive to investors when stock markets are volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Conclusion on Investment Timing

Considering the converging factors—strong industrial demand, limited supply, potential central bank interest, favorable [[Silver as an Investment Compared to Gold | gold-silver ratio]], and its role as a hedge against volatility and inflation—the current period is seen as a unique situation for [[Methods to Invest in Silver | investing in silver]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The increased adoption of silver among households, as seen during Dhanteras, further underscores this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

One of the most-watched videos on the channel, which discussed a "lifetime portfolio" constructed using a combination of momentum and value indices, has prompted a revision due to recent market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This initial [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | strategy]] involved two Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs): a Nifty 500 Value 50 index since December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> and a Nifty 200 Momentum 30 fund from April 2021 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The momentum fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) initially grew from 10 to over 25 by September 2024, before crashing to 18 and currently resting around 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This 28% drop in NAV over six months (September 2024 to March 2025) highlights the need to revisit and revise the initial [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Original Premise and Revisions
The core argument for the original [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | strategy]] was that momentum and value indices are weakly correlated and exhibit significant annual performance gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. A long-term [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investment]] in these indices was believed to build a passive, stable, yet powerful portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Revisions made in this update include:
*   **Extended Timeline** The data is updated until April 25, 2025, from the earlier 2022 timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Index Change** The Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index has been replaced with the Nifty 500 Momentum 50 index, and the Nifty 500 Value 50 index is also used, as both represent the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Sourcing Index Values
Index values are sourced from niftyindices.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
1.  Navigate to "Reports" on the top navbar, then click "Historical Data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
2.  Select "Total Returns Index Value" (TRRI, which is Price Return plus dividend) from the orange drop-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
3.  Choose "Equity" from the next drop-down, select the desired index and dates, then click submit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
4.  Download the neatly organized daily data as a CSV file and use Excel formulas to extract monthly values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Performance of Momentum and Value Indices
### Momentum Index Performance
The last six months have significantly impacted the trailing return numbers for momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index grew by about 26% over the last five years (April 2020 onwards, a period starting at the stock market's COVID-induced low), a longer 10-year period shows an average return of around 18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Value Index Performance
Value indices have historically given around 15% to 15.5% returns over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Comparative Analysis
On a rolling return basis, momentum indices have generally outperformed value over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This might lead some to question why bother with value and not invest solely in momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Every [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | strategy]] (growth, value, momentum, low volatility, dividend) experiences periods of ups and downs, emphasizing the importance of examining information over a longer timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Rationale for a Balanced Allocation
While momentum may appear to have performed better over 10-15 years, a balanced allocation is recommended, not based on emotion, but on numerical analysis, especially when examining data on an SIP basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Consider a 10-year SIP of ₹10,000 per month starting April 1, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   By March 31, 2025, an [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investment]] of ₹12 lakhs would have accumulated to ₹35.6 lakhs for momentum and ₹38 lakhs for value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   This translates to an annualized return of 19.9% for momentum and a surprising 21.1% for value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

This unexpected outcome for value is due to the period between January 2018 and the end of 2022, when the momentum index more than doubled while the value index remained relatively static <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. During this time, monthly [[investment_approaches_in_the_fire_strategy | investments]] into the value index accumulated units at a low NAV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. When a significant jump occurred in 2023, these units grew by 300% in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Benefits of a Combined SIP Strategy
A 50/50 combination of the Nifty 500 Momentum 50 index and the Nifty 500 Value 50 index on an SIP basis over the past 10 years yielded an annualized return of 20.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. While the percentage returns for standalone momentum, standalone value, and the 50/50 combination are similar, the combined approach smooths the [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

The weak correlation between value and momentum is evident in the performance gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. For example, between October 2024 and April 2025, the momentum index was down 25%, while the value index was down 13-14%, an 11-12% difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Such gaps are common, and during these times, SIPs help grow the absolute portfolio and reduce volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Revisiting the Switch Strategy
A "switch [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | strategy]]" covered in a previous video meant fully exiting one index and using the proceeds to enter the other ("all in or all out") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. However, attempting to time a switch between momentum and value is confusing and difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

A balanced approach (e.g., 50/50 momentum and value) is advocated to achieve potential returns of 17-19% over longer periods without active intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

> [!TIP] If one must intervene, consider pausing momentum SIPs and avoiding lump-sum [[investment_approaches_in_the_fire_strategy | investments]] when the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio for momentum funds is high (e.g., 24 and above) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Funds can then be moved to value or safer options like liquid money market or equity savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Excessive meddling is generally not helpful for long-term [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
*   The hypothesis that momentum and value are not tightly correlated remains valid, evidenced by glaring performance gaps over specific time frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   Over 19 years, momentum has performed very well with 18-19% returns and a high probability of 15%+ performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   Both indices offer a balancing act that helps reduce portfolio volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The allocation ratio (e.g., 50/50, 60/40) is a personal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   The SIP [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | strategy]] further confirms that systematic [[investment_approaches_in_the_fire_strategy | investing]] is the best, safest, and most logical way to invest in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   The recent 25-30% fall in momentum and 17% decline in value over 5-6 months reinforce the importance of these findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

[[Mohnish Pabrai investment strategy | Mohnish Pabrai]] is known for his investment philosophy, which includes identifying companies that have a "hidden P/E of one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. He states that if an investor holds a bunch of stocks at a P/E of one, generally good things will happen to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Understanding P/E Ratio

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is a widely used valuation metric, calculated by dividing the present price by past earnings to gauge future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. However, it is a company's *future* earnings that truly determine the return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### Visible P/E of One

A visible P/E of one occurs when a company's share price is equal to or less than its earnings per share (EPS) over the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Such companies are rare; out of over 4,000 companies on the Indian Stock Exchange, only about 17 had a visible P/E of one at the time of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

### Hidden P/E of One

A "hidden P/E of one" refers to companies that currently have a high P/E ratio, but their future per-share earnings are highly probable to be higher than their current price per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This concept suggests looking beyond current valuations to forecast future earnings growth. For example, Avenue Supermarts (DMart) has a P/E of 112, but if it continues its average earnings growth of 25% per year, it could effectively reach a P/E of one in approximately 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

## Identifying Hidden P/E of One Companies

Four key learnings emerge when seeking companies with a hidden P/E of one:

1.  **Profit Growth is Primary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>: Companies consistently growing profits by more than 20% (e.g., Avenue Supermarts, Varun Beverages, IRCTC) are more likely to achieve a hidden P/E of one, even if their current P/E is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Starting Valuation Matters** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>: While high growth helps, starting with a low P/E ratio significantly improves a company's chances of reaching a P/E of one sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
3.  **Time Horizon for Visibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>: A multi-decade plan for a company to reach a P/E of one is not ideal due to various market uncertainties (competition, demand changes, technology, regulations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. Ideally, investors should look for companies with a P/E of one visibility over a maximum of five to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
4.  **Company Size** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>: A hidden P/E of one might be more commonly found in mid- and small-cap companies rather than large-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Alibaba Group Holdings Limited

Alibaba Group Holdings Limited is presented as an example of a company with a potential hidden P/E of one, despite enduring significant market valuation drops (almost 80% from its all-time high) due to geopolitics, re-election, and regulatory changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

At the time of analysis:
*   Share price: $65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   Net cash position: $70 billion, equating to about $10 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   Cash-adjusted price: $55 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   FY23 consensus EPS estimate: $7.11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   Cash-adjusted P/E for FY23: 7.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   Projected FY28 EPS: $14.29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   P/E for FY28: 3.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Economic Earnings (Free Cash Flow)

Beyond accounting earnings (EPS), economic earnings, represented by free cash flow (FCF), are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. For Alibaba, free cash flow numbers have historically averaged 40% higher than EPS numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Adjusting the projected FY28 EPS of $14.29 by this historical trend suggests a "hidden EPS" of $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. This brings Alibaba's hidden P/E (using the cash-adjusted price of $55) down to 2.75, significantly closer to the target P/E of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

## Cautions and Practical Considerations

*   **Infrequent Phenomenon**: A P/E of one is an infrequent market occurrence. An investor might be lucky to find such a company once every three or four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Businesses**: Be cautious with cyclical businesses, as their P/E ratios are volatile, and visibility beyond one or two years is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. For cyclicals, demand-supply gaps often determine the price more than earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Direct Parameters**: When identifying P/E of one stocks, focus on direct parameters like sales growth, profit growth, operating margins, and companies with pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.
*   **Turnaround Situations**: Consider examining "turnaround" companies â€“ good companies facing temporary trouble that can recover with capital infusion and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. These can fit the hidden P/E of one criteria despite initial risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.
*   **Look Beyond Screeners**: Investors should learn to look beyond standard stock screeners to find such companies, always keeping an eye out for businesses that can reach a future P/E of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

While a portfolio composed entirely of P/E of one stocks is challenging to achieve, finding a few such companies can significantly contribute to wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

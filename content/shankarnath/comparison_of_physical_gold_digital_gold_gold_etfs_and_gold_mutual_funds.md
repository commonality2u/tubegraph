Since the dawn of human civilization, approximately 200,000 tons of gold have been mined globally, a quantity comparable to the weight of the ship that was stuck in the Suez Canal for a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This mined gold is distributed across various uses: about half is used for jewelry, 20% is in the form of coins, mutual funds, and [[Advantages of investing in Gold ETFs | ETFs]], 18% is held by central banks worldwide, and the remainder is integrated into industrial applications like smartphones, microchips, medicines, and even tooth fillings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. A significant portion of this is considered "investable gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

While gold investment may not appeal to everyone, famously disliked by Warren Buffett (who notably invested in 3,700 tons of silver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, it offers several [[Benefits of investing in gold | advantages for investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>:
*   **Historical Returns** Over the past 40 years, gold has delivered a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.2%, increasing to 10.5% with annual Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Downside Protection** The price of gold has fallen year-on-year only seven times in the last 40 years, with a maximum annual fall of 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This performance is notably better than the BSE Sensex, which has experienced annual falls of 14% or more on seven different occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Lower Volatility** Gold is considerably less volatile compared to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Hedging Tool** Gold exhibits an inverse correlation with stock markets, making it an effective hedging tool for asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It typically performs well during periods of stock market depression or financial calamities, as observed in 1991-92, 2000, 2008-09, 2020, and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

It is often recommended that investors allocate around 10% of their portfolios to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Gold can be acquired in various [[Different ways to invest in gold | forms]], including physical gold (jewelry, coins, bullion) and electronic instruments like digital gold, [[Advantages of investing in Gold ETFs | Gold ETFs]], gold mutual funds, and [[Comparison of Gold ETFs physical gold and Sovereign Gold Bonds | Sovereign Gold Bonds]] (SGBs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Comparison of Gold Investment Options

When considering different gold investment options, several attributes are critical for investors to evaluate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>:

### Availability
*   **Physical Gold** Readily available from bank branches (gold coins) or neighborhood jewelers (ornaments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Indian households are estimated to hold 25,000 tons of gold, accounting for 12% of all gold ever mined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold** Distributed by most fintech companies and accessible via numerous mobile applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Gold Mutual Funds & Gold ETFs** Available on aggregator platforms, trading platforms, and mutual fund websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)** Primarily time-bound, with the RBI releasing new tranches every few months through five-day buying windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. However, SGBs are also tradable on Indian stock exchanges, allowing investors to buy and sell them via trading accounts outside the primary issue windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Overall Accessibility** All five gold options are considered sufficiently accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Risk
*   **Physical Gold** Poses risks such as theft, quality tampering, and potential loss during the making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold** While avoiding the physical risks, digital gold carries a significant risk due to a lack of regulatory oversight; it is not supervised by bodies like SEBI or RBI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This absence of regulation is a major drawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs** Backed by actual physical gold of 99.5% purity, stored with custodian banks, and periodically valued as per SEBI guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This provides regulatory backing and real gold asset support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Gold Mutual Funds** Essentially an extension of the ETF structure, as most gold mutual funds invest in one or multiple gold ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)** Not backed by physical gold; instead, they are derivative instruments where the Government of India uses gold prices to define the bond's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The RBI promises to pay the bond's maturity amount based on the gold price at maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The primary risk is government default, which is generally very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Standard reinvestment and inflation [[Risks and returns associated with different gold investment options | risks]] apply to all financial instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Starting Investment / Minimum Quantity
*   **Physical Gold** Gold coins can be bought starting from half a gram (0.5 grams), costing over 3500 Rupees at current prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold** Highly fractionalized and can be purchased for as little as one rupee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs** Requires buying at least one unit, which is 0.01 grams of gold, or roughly 60 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Gold Mutual Funds** Have a low entry amount, requiring just 100 Rupees to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)** Requires a minimum purchase quantity of one gram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Overall Accessibility** Gold's availability in smaller quantities makes it more accessible than many other financial instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Returns and Costs
For gold investments, returns and costs are often intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Physical Gold (especially jewelry)** Incurs three major costs:
    *   Design and making charges.
    *   Storage costs.
    *   3% GST.
    *   These can collectively add 10% to 20% over the gold price, not including insurance and bank locker fees, making it a weak option from a Return on Investment (ROI) perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold** Subject to 3% GST on purchase, which affects returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. It also has a significant buy-sell spread. For example, buying 1 gram at 6400 rupees and selling it at 6029 rupees results in a 371 rupee difference, or a 5.8% spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This spread is justified by the company's costs for storage, technology, transportation, and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs** Come with an expense ratio typically between 0.5% and 0.7%, plus smaller costs like brokerage, demat account charges, STT, and stamp charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Gold Mutual Funds** Appear to have low direct plan expense ratios (e.g., 0.1-0.2%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, this figure does not include the expense ratio of the underlying [[Comparison of ETFs and Mutual Funds | Gold ETFs]] they invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The actual expense ratio is the sum of the fund's own expense ratio and that of the underlying ETF (e.g., SBI Gold Fund's 0.1% + SBI Gold ETF's 0.64% = 0.74%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)** Have no visible expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Investors paying online are even eligible for a 50-rupee per gram discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Additionally, SGBs offer a fixed interest of 2.5% per annum on the initial investment, credited twice a year, a feature unique among these gold products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Comparative Yields (assuming 9% gold appreciation)**:
    *   SGBs: 9% + 2.5% = 11.5% expected return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
    *   Gold ETFs: 9% - 0.6% (expense) = 8.4% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   Gold Mutual Funds: Approximately 8.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
    *   Digital Gold: Around 7.7% over a five-year period due to buy-sell spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
    *   Physical Gold: Expected to yield the least <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Conclusion on Returns** [[Comparison of Gold ETFs physical gold and Sovereign Gold Bonds | Sovereign Gold Bonds]] generally offer the highest returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Liquidity
Liquidity is crucial, especially in India where gold is often viewed as a savings instrument for family needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Physical Gold** Jewelers typically buy ornaments or coins and pay on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs & Mutual Funds** Can be liquidated during trading hours, though it may take a couple of days for funds to reach the bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold** The most liquid option, with units salable 24x7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)** Come with an 8-year maturity period, but early redemption is possible:
    *   **Secondary Market:** Bonds can be traded on Indian Stock Exchanges after six months of issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. However, due to low liquidity, SGBs often sell at a discount in the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   **Premature Encashment:** RBI allows premature encashment after five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
    *   **Loan Option:** Loans can be taken against SGBs; for example, State Bank of India allows up to 20 lakhs with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) of up to 65% of the bond's market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### Taxes
Tax implications vary at the time of buying, selling, or maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **At Purchase:** A 3% GST is charged when buying physical or digital gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Capital Gains Tax (at selling):**
    *   **Physical Gold & Digital Gold:**
        *   If held for less than three years, gains are taxed at the investor's marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
        *   If sold after three years, gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   **Gold ETFs & Gold Mutual Funds:** The concept of holding period has been removed. Any gains are now taxed as per the applicable slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
    *   **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs):**
        *   The 2.5% annual interest received is added to one's income and taxed at the prevailing income tax slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
        *   If the SGB is redeemed at the end of eight years (at maturity), the capital gains made are entirely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This tax exemption at maturity applies regardless of whether the SGB was bought during its launch or from the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
        *   Regarding premature redemption after five years (RBI-allowed redemption in 6th, 7th, or 8th year), some sources indicate it is tax-free, while others suggest it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. It's advisable to consult a tax advisor for clarity on this specific point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

Gold holds a special place, particularly in countries like India, which has more goldsmiths than bank ATMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

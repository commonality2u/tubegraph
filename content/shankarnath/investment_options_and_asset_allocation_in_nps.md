The National Pension System (NPS) is a voluntary defined contribution pension scheme, initially introduced in 2004 and extended to all Indian citizens in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its primary purpose is to help citizens accumulate money for retirement, which can then be converted into a post-retirement monthly payout or pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The NPS offers a number of benefits, including a low-cost structure, tax breaks, market-linked returns, easy portability, and [[management_and_performance_of_nps_funds | professional management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Asset Classes in NPS

NPS offers four asset classes for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>:

*   **Class E (Equity)**: Money is invested in the stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Class G (Government Securities)**: Investments include bonds, T-bills, and various securities issued by the central or state government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Class C (Corporate Debt)**: Funds are used to purchase bonds issued by PSUs (Public Sector Undertakings), public financial institutions, infrastructure companies, and money market instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Class A (Alternative Investment Funds)**: This includes investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and InvITs (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

These asset classes are designed to cater to different risk-return profiles, with equities and government securities typically at either end of the spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The combination of these four asset classes (E, G, C, A) significantly impacts the growth of your NPS corpus by retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Asset Allocation Options

Subscribers have two main options for [[asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation]] within NPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>:

### 1. Auto Choice

The auto choice option is suitable for investors who prefer not to make their own [[asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation]] decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Under this option, funds are allocated based on a methodology-driven, life cycle-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The portfolio starts with a higher equity exposure when the subscriber is young, which is then systematically rebalanced and reduced as the subscriber approaches retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

NPS offers three types of life cycle funds for auto choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>:

*   **Aggressive Life Cycle Fund**: Maximum equity allocation can go up to 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. For subscribers aged 35 or younger, this portfolio would initially have 75% in equities, 10% in corporate debt, and 15% in government securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. As the subscriber ages, the equity percentage is reduced, and the proportion of government bonds is increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Moderate Life Cycle Fund**: Equities are capped at 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The equity component tapers down gradually from 50% (up to age 35) to 10% by the age of 55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Conservative Option**: Equities are limited to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The rebalancing between asset classes occurs automatically once a year on the subscriber's date of birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 2. Active Choice

The active choice option is available for NPS subscribers who wish to design their own portfolio and decide their own [[asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. While this offers more freedom, it comes with certain conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>:

*   The maximum permissible allocation to equities (Class E) is 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   Alternative investment funds (Class A) are capped at 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   This option is available only to Tier 1 NPS investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Previously, subscribers had to lower their equity allocation by 2.5% annually after reaching age 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. However, this requirement has been removed, allowing NPS investors to maintain 75% in equities until age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

The choice between auto and active options depends on an individual's understanding of [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | asset allocation and rebalancing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Subscribers are allowed to move between auto and active choices once per financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## NPS Investment Performance

NPS returns are market-linked and depend on the [[management_and_performance_of_nps_funds | performance of the pension fund manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

*   **Overall Returns**: On average, Class E (equities) has yielded around 13% over a 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Government securities and corporate bonds have returned slightly over 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Class A schemes have clocked about 6% returns over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Generally, NPS is estimated to have delivered returns in the range of 10-11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Pension Fund Performance**: Unlike mutual funds, the performance of pension funds within each category has been quite similar to one another and close to their respective benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Government Securities (Class G)**: LIC and Aditya Birla have shown good performance in this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. NPS Class G schemes tend to have a higher maturity (14-17 years) compared to typical gilt funds (8-11 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   **Corporate Bonds (Class C)**: The average NPS fund has slightly outperformed the S&P BSE Corporate Bond Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This may be due to the ability of NPS Class C funds to invest in instruments like rupee bonds, listed debt from banks, corporates, and Tier 1 bonds, as long as the rating is AA and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Funds can also invest up to 10% in lower-rated A-paper, which can boost performance at slightly higher credit risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. HDFC and ICICI Prudential's Class C funds have shown reasonable performance and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
    *   **Equities (Class E)**: Most NPS funds in this category have a strong large-cap bias, with at least 90% of holdings in large-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. HDFC and Kotak Mahindra have been consistent and better performers in this segment, though NPS Class E funds have generally slightly underperformed the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Selecting a Pension Fund Manager

Currently, there are 10 pension fund managers for NPS assets, including major players like SBI, HDFC, ICICI, Axis, and life insurance-promoted managers like LIC Pension Fund and Max Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

While subscribers can choose different pension managers for their Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts, they cannot select different fund managers for different schemes within the same tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This means an NPS subscriber must select only one pension fund manager to manage all four asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

The selection of a fund manager requires evaluating their performance on a portfolio basis rather than on specific asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Although most NPS schemes deliver similar returns across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, subscribers are allowed to change their fund manager once per financial year if they feel compelled to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | asset allocation]] strategy chosen by an NPS subscriber, whether through auto or active choice, plays a significant role in the accumulation part of a retirement plan and the final corpus achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

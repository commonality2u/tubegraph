From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

The performance of stocks in an investment portfolio often overlooks the significant contribution of dividends. While investors might recall changes in share prices, they frequently disregard dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

In India, a substantial number of companies declare dividends:
*   Half of companies listed on the Indian stock exchange with a market capitalization over 100 crores declared a dividend last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   This figure increases to two out of three for companies valued at 1,000 crores or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   In the 10,000 crore-plus category, three out of four companies offer a dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   The top 10 dividend-paying companies in India collectively disbursed ₹2.06 lakh crores in dividends in the last financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Components of Total Investment Return

Historically, in the US until the 1940s, a simple rule for asset allocation was followed: if the [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yield]] (dividend per share / share price) was higher than the yield of a Government Bond, investors would buy equity; otherwise, they would invest in government-backed debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

From the 1950s onwards, [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yields]] began to decline due to reduced dividend payouts, particularly in the 1980s when the SEC offered incentives for corporations to repurchase their own shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Your total return on investment is not solely dependent on an increase in stock price. It also includes:
*   Dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

As of 2023, the S&P 500 offered a [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yield]] of 1.7% and a buyback yield of 2.9%, contributing a "hidden return" of 4.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total returns for the S&P 500, ranging from 15% to 50% in different decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

For the Nifty 50, data from the last 10 years indicates that about 18% of the total returns on a standard SIP are attributable to received dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

**Example: ITC Limited**
Over the last decade (2013-2023):
*   Capital appreciation: Stock price increased from ₹220 to ₹440, a CAGR of 7.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Dividends: ITC rewarded shareholders with almost ₹90 in dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Total Return (with reinvested dividends): CAGR of 10.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

The total returns of any equity instrument are the summation of its capital appreciation and its dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## [[dividend_investing_strategies | Dividend Investing Strategies]]

Two major [[dividend_investing_strategies | investing strategies]] utilize dividends as a selection tool rather than just for passive income:

### [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | High Dividend Yield Strategy]]

This strategy focuses on companies that pay out a high percentage of their stock price in dividends annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

**Example: Castrol India**
*   Stock price: ₹113 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>
*   Dividend (FY2023): ₹6.50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>
*   [[dividend_discount_model | Dividend Yield]]: 5.8% (₹6.50 / ₹113) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>

A [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | high dividend yield]] requires a company to generate consistent profits and free cash flows, which can be cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. For example, some companies in the metal, oil, and gas sectors have reduced dividends due to lower profits, while others like Coal India, REC Power Finance, Oracle Financial Services, and Castrol India have been consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

[[dividend_discount_model | Dividend yields]] show wider inconsistencies due to factors like present valuation and economic climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The big jump in FY21 [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yields]], despite many companies reducing payouts, was due to depressed valuations from the coronavirus pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This makes predicting future [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yields]] difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

**Mutual Funds and [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | High Dividend Yield]]**
*   "Dividend yield funds" exist (e.g., HDFC, ICICI, SBI) with substantial Assets Under Management (AUM) and a track record of outperforming the Nifty 50 over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   However, many of these "supposed [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | high dividend yield]] funds" are invested in low-dividend yielding stocks, with barely three or four companies in their portfolios having a [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yield]] over 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This means what an AMC does might differ from what an investor expects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

**Passive Alternatives: Nifty Dividend Opportunities 50 Index**
*   Comprises 50 stocks selected from the top 300 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   Companies are ranked by annual [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yield]] for selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   Includes high-dividend yielding stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   On a performance and [[Volatility in stock markets and its impact on investment decisions | volatility]] basis, it doesn't show significant difference compared to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

**Conclusion for [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | High Dividend Yield]] Strategy:**
Picking stocks purely based on a [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | high dividend yield]] may not be the ideal approach to stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### [[dividend_growth_vs_high_dividend_yield | Dividend Growth Strategy]]

This strategy leverages the power of compounding. An investment in a company that not only pays a dividend but also grows its profits, share price, and dividend rate annually can lead to significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

**Dividend Growers** are stocks that have the potential to increase their dividends in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. They differ from [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | high dividend yield stocks]], which may or may not increase future dividend rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Studies across different markets show that [[dividend_growth_vs_high_dividend_yield | dividend growth stocks]] outperform [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | high dividend yielding stocks]] in bullish, bearish, and neutral markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. They tend to offer higher and less [[Volatility in stock markets and its impact on investment decisions | volatile]] returns compared to most other strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

#### The [[Dividend Aristocrats | Dividend Aristocrats]] Model

A prominent [[dividend_growth_vs_high_dividend_yield | dividend growth strategy]] is based on the [[Dividend Aristocrats | Dividend Aristocrats]] index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This index measures the performance of S&P 500 companies that have consistently increased dividends every year for at least 25 consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

**Characteristics of [[Dividend Aristocrats | Dividend Aristocrats]]:**
*   Exhibit both capital growth and dividend income characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   Deliver higher returns with low [[Volatility in stock markets and its impact on investment decisions | volatility]] compared to the S&P 500 benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   Consistently provide a [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yield]] higher than their benchmark. For instance, [[Dividend Aristocrats | Aristocrats]] are at 2.5% [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yield]] compared to S&P 500's 1.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   Exhibit both growth (increasing dividends and share price) and value (high [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yield]] and lower price multiples) characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## The Role of [[Factor investing and its impact on portfolio returns | Factors]]

While [[dividend_aristocrats | dividend growth strategies]] perform well due to increasing dividends per share, it is believed that these stocks also gain accidental exposure to other relatable [[Factor investing and its impact on portfolio returns | factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. These [[Factor investing and its impact on portfolio returns | factors]] include:
*   Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>
*   Quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>
*   Price-to-earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>
*   [[Volatility in stock markets and its impact on investment decisions | Volatility]]-to-Value ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>
*   Free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>

Academic research supports that combining a simple [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yield]] metric with other [[Factor investing and its impact on portfolio returns | factors]] like [[Volatility in stock markets and its impact on investment decisions | volatility]], quality, momentum, and size can deliver returns exceeding a market cap-weighted index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Applying Strategies in India

In the Indian scenario, there are no mutual funds or ETFs solely based on the [[Dividend Aristocrats | Dividend Aristocrat]] concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. However, smallcases exist that align with this concept:
*   One free smallcase includes companies like Asian Paints, HDFC, HUL, ITC, Marico, Pidilite, and Infosys, which generally show a consistent and increasing trend of dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   Another paid smallcase applies multiple [[Factor investing and its impact on portfolio returns | factors]] (e.g., low debt, management record, price-earning valuation multiples) on top of [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | high dividend yielding stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

Articles from economictimes.com list Indian companies that align with these strategies:
*   "10 high dividend paying stocks" (focus on [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | high dividend yield]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   An article from 2021 featured 20 Indian companies that consistently grew their dividends over 20 years, each delivering a CAGR over 15%, further proving the value of a [[dividend_growth_vs_high_dividend_yield | dividend growth strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Important Considerations: Quality of Dividends

Not all dividends are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The source of the dividend payment is crucial:
*   **Healthy Dividend**: Paid from the company's cash flow from operations, indicating a self-sufficient setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **Unhealthy Dividend**: Paid by borrowing or raising capital to finance the payment; such payouts are not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

To distinguish between high-quality and low-quality dividend payers, examine:
*   Net profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>
*   Cash flow from operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>
*   Free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>

Avoid the **[[high_dividend_yield_stocks | dividend value trap]]**, where a high [[dividend_discount_model | dividend yield]] masks a stagnant or declining business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. To prevent this, examine the company's Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. If ROCE is consistently above the cost of capital (e.g., over 14-15%), you are less likely to fall into this trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

Dividends are not merely a means of earning passive income. [[dividend_growth_vs_high_dividend_yield | Dividend growth]] can be a powerful stock selection criterion that can significantly improve portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Combining different [[Factor investing and its impact on portfolio returns | factors]] with either [[high_dividend_yield_stocks | high dividend yield]] or [[dividend_growth_vs_high_dividend_yield | dividend growth strategies]] can lead to superior returns with less [[Volatility in stock markets and its impact on investment decisions | volatility]] and better downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

The core quest in stock investment is to determine a share's true worth, also known as its [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This assessment prevents investors from overpaying for a stock and helps identify undervalued opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. However, there is no 100% accurate answer; calculating [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] is merely an estimation of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:08">[01:29:08]</a>.

It's crucial for an investor to understand a company's current condition and growth potential before undertaking any quantitative analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>. As Warren Buffett stated, it's "far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than to buy a fair company at a wonderful price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:52">[02:08:52]</a>. Quantitative calculations of [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] should only be performed if the company passes a qualitative checklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>.

## Methods for Calculating Intrinsic Value

This article will explore three distinct methods for calculating a share's true worth, using Infosys as a primary example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Infosys is visualized as a "money printing machine" that has steadily increased its earnings over the years, delivering over 33,000 crores in the last financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. Its market capitalization was 5,84,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

### 1. Relative Value Model

The relative value model compares the financials of a target company with its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>.

#### Key Metrics
*   **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Multiple**: This is a popular metric for companies with relatively stable earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:09">[02:28:09]</a>.
    *   Among large [[indian_it_services_sector_growth_and_market_share | IT services companies]], the median P/E ratio is 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>.
    *   Wipro has a P/E of 19, while LNT Technology trades at 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:04">[02:45:04]</a>.
    *   A stock trading at a low P/E, like Wipro, suggests potential upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>.
    *   **Example Calculation for Wipro**: If Wipro (current price 417 rupees, P/E 19.7) were to reach Infosys's implied P/E of 24, its estimated future price would be 508 rupees per share (417 * 24 / 19.7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.
*   **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Useful for comparing capital-intensive industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.
*   **Price to Free Cash Flows**: HCL Tech appears undervalued compared to peers using this metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:05">[03:37:05]</a>.
*   **Historical P/E Ratio** and **52-week High/Low**: Relative value can also be found by looking at historical trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:02">[03:45:02]</a>.

#### Limitations
This method is less effective in cyclical industries or volatile markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:01">[03:55:01]</a>. It's also less relevant for diversified portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:06">[04:03:06]</a>. Other variables like sales and profit growth (where Wipro has been lacking), competitive advantages, and management quality cannot be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:02">[04:14:02]</a>.

### 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method

The DCF method aims to find the present value of a business's future cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:08">[04:26:08]</a>. As Warren Buffett describes it, [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] is "the number that if you were all knowing about the future and could predict all the cash that a business would give you between now and judgment day discounted at the proper discount rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>.

The process involves two main pieces of information: how much cash the business will generate in the future and what that future cash is worth today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

#### Five Steps for DCF Valuation of Infosys

1.  **Understand Owner's Earnings**:
    *   Owner's earnings are calculated by subtracting maintenance capital expenditure from operating cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:05">[05:37:05]</a>.
    *   Infosys's operating cash flow for FY23 was over 31,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:01">[05:53:01]</a>.
    *   Using an expenditure row from the cash flow statement (31,261 minus 2,579 crores), Infosys's owner's earnings for FY23 were 28,682 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
    *   This formula for owner's earnings can be tweaked by different investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:06">[06:44:06]</a>. Using total capex instead of maintenance capex defines "free cash flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:02">[06:58:02]</a>. Infosys itself reported a free cash flow of 20,443 crores in its annual report, showing variations in calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:01">[07:25:01]</a>.

2.  **Imagine the Future (Cash Flow Projections)**:
    *   **Part 1: Owner's Earnings Buildup**: Project owner's earnings over the next 10 years (e.g., 7% growth tapering to 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:02">[07:59:02]</a>. This would see Infosys's 28,000 crores grow to an estimated 50,000 crores by 2033 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:03">[08:11:03]</a>.
    *   **Part 2: Terminal Value**: In the 10th year, assume the business is sold, receiving a "terminal value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:04">[08:18:04]</a>.
        *   Historically, Infosys's market cap to owner's earnings ratio averaged almost 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:04">[08:47:04]</a>.
        *   Using a conservative multiple of 16 for the terminal value in the 10th year, 16 times 50,867 crores equals 8,13,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.
    *   DCF modeling involves many assumptions, making it a tricky exercise. For example, an 8% growth rate and a terminal value multiple of 22 would increase the total cash flows by 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:04">[09:10:04]</a>. Investors must be honest and avoid emotional projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:06">[09:37:06]</a>.

3.  **Discount Future Cash Flows to Present Value**:
    *   This step brings future cash flows to their worth today, similar to reversing a fixed deposit calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:01">[10:37:01]</a>.
    *   To find the present value of a future cash flow, divide it by (1 + discount rate) raised to the power of the number of years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:04">[11:03:04]</a>.
    *   **Discount Rate**: This is a critical number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:08">[12:18:08]</a>.
        *   **Impact**: A higher discount rate (e.g., 14%) results in a lower present value (e.g., 4,20,000 crores) compared to a lower discount rate (e.g., 8% yielding 6,40,000 crores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:02">[12:04:02]</a>.
        *   **Approaches**: Include cost of capital, hurdle rate, market data, and intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:04">[12:22:04]</a>.
        *   **Personal Rate**: The speaker generally uses 12% as a minimum acceptable return for any company, large or small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.
    *   Applying a 12% discount rate to Infosys's estimated future cash flows yields a present value sum total of 4,80,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.

4.  **Add Cash and Liquid Investments**:
    *   Infosys's latest annual report shows cash equivalents of over 12,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.
    *   Liquid investments (mutual funds, government securities, etc.) total over 19,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.
    *   Adding these to the present value of cash flows (4.8 lakh crores) gives a total [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] of 5,12,145 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

5.  **Calculate Intrinsic Value Per Share and Apply Margin of Safety**:
    *   Divide the total [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] by the number of shares (Infosys has almost 420 crores shares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.
    *   This computes to an [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] of 1,221 rupees per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Margin of Safety**: Because DCF relies on assumptions, a "margin of safety" is applied as a layer of protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.
        *   An additional discount (e.g., 30%) is applied to the computed [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.
        *   For Infosys, a 30% margin of safety reduces the buy price to 854 rupees per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. This is a crucial element in any [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuation exercise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.

#### Summary for Infosys using DCF
*   **Intrinsic Value**: 5,12,000 crores, or 1,221 rupees per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.
*   **Current Market Price (at time of recording)**: 1,424 rupees per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.
*   **Overvaluation**: Approximately 16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.
*   **Buy Price (with 30% margin of safety)**: 854 rupees per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>.

### 3. Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

The dividend discount model is a framework based on expected future dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. It requires three inputs:
*   Current dividend per share (numerator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.
*   Discount rate (denominator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.
*   Dividend growth rate (subtracted from the discount rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.

#### Calculation for Infosys
*   **Current Dividend (FY23)**: 32 rupees and 50 paisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.
*   **Discount Rate**: 12% (consistent with DCF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.
*   **Dividend Growth Rate**: Estimated at 8% (aligned with profit growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.

Using the formula (Current Dividend / (Discount Rate - Dividend Growth Rate)), the intrinsic value is 32.5 / (0.12 - 0.08) = 812 rupees per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>. Compared to the current market price, this model suggests Infosys is extremely overpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.

#### Critique of DDM
This approach is generally not favored by the speaker and is not a feasible strategy for growth stocks that pay little or no dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

While all three [[intrinsic_value_calculation_methods | intrinsic value calculation methods]] involve estimations and assumptions, they provide a valuable starting point for understanding a business's potential value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. The clear understanding of a company's goals, [[financial_metrics_and_valuations_in_it_companies | financial metrics]], and milestones is paramount in making these projections accurate and honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

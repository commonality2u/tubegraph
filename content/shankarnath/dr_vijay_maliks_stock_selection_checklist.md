Dr. Vijay Malik, a full-time equity investor since 2016, is known for his insights shared through workshops, courses, and a comprehensive blog [00:00:34]. His "final checklist for buying stocks" provides a structured approach to stock selection, breaking it down into four main categories: financial metrics, business parameters, valuation-related numbers, and company management [00:01:23]. This checklist can be applied using [[investment_strategies_using_stock_screeners | stock screeners]] to identify potential investment opportunities [00:01:03].

## Financial Metrics

The checklist begins with eight key financial variables:

1.  **Sales Growth**
    *   Dr. Malik prefers a consistent sales growth of at least 15% over a period of seven to ten years, without significant spikes or drops [00:01:43]. Applying this on a standard screener initially yielded 274 companies [00:01:55].
2.  **Profitability (Net Profit Margin)**
    *   A net profit margin of at least 8% is required [00:02:03], which reduced the list to 111 companies [00:02:08].
3.  **Tax Payout**
    *   Companies should have a tax rate closer to the general corporate tax rate, which Dr. Malik considers 30%, though the speaker notes 25% is more current [00:02:13]. This criterion can be harsh, potentially excluding companies with tax holidays or accumulated losses [00:02:29].
4.  **Interest Coverage**
    *   This ratio, indicating a company's ability to service its debt, should be at least three [00:02:41]. This narrowed the list to 42 companies [00:02:52].
5.  **Debt to Equity Ratio**
    *   A ratio less than 0.5 suggests the company is not over-leveraged, reducing the risk during downturns [00:02:55].
6.  **Current Ratio**
    *   To assess a company's ability to meet short-term liabilities with short-term assets, the current ratio must be at least 1.25 times [00:03:09].
7.  **Cash Flow from Operations**
    *   The company should consistently generate positive cash flow from operations over one, three, and five-year periods [00:03:24]. This criterion reduced the list to 23 companies [00:03:31].
8.  **Comparison of Profit After Tax (PAT) with Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)**
    *   While no specific numbers are given by Dr. Malik, the principle is that CFO should be in close proximity to net profits. This indicates that reported earnings are backed by actual cash inflows from core operations [00:03:42].
    *   Significant divergence (e.g., operational cash flow much lower than net profit) can imply aggressive revenue recognition, working capital changes (like lenient credit terms), or a high percentage of non-cash items (e.g., depreciation) [00:04:04].
    *   For screener purposes, a deviation of not more than plus/minus 20% between operational cash flows and net profit numbers is suggested [00:04:41].

After applying all eight financial metrics, an initial universe of 4300+ companies was reduced to just 11 [00:04:49]. The speaker purposefully removed one low market cap entry, leaving 10 companies that align with Dr. Malik's financial [[stock_selection_criteria_inspired_by_peter_lynch | stock picking rules]] [00:04:56].

## Business Parameters

The next set of five metrics relates to the business and its operations:

1.  **Comparison with Industry Peers (Sales Growth)**
    *   A company's sales growth should be higher than its competitors, indicating an economic moat [00:05:33]. For example, Pi Industries demonstrated consistent and faster sales growth compared to its agrochemical peers [00:05:43].
2.  **Increase in Production Capacity and Sales Volume**
    *   Companies should show an increase in both production capacity and sales volume [00:06:09].
3.  **Conversion of Sales Growth into Profit Growth**
    *   Sales growth and profit growth should be in alignment. It is undesirable for sales to be flat while profits grow, or for sales to grow much faster than profits (as seen with Sharda Crop Chem) [00:06:23].
4.  **Conversion of Profits into Cash**
    *   This is a reiteration of the eighth financial metric, emphasizing that profits and operational cash flow should be in close proximity [00:06:45].
5.  **Creation of Shareholder Value from Retained Profits**
    *   The company's increase in market capitalization over the last 10 years should be greater than the increase in retained earnings [00:07:01]. From the shortlisted companies, only Signity Technology had grown its market capitalization at a slower pace than its reserves [00:07:18].

## Management Analysis

An investor also needs to analyze the company's management:

1.  **Promoter and Director Background Check**
    *   A thorough background check of the company's promoters and directors is essential [00:08:29].
2.  **Succession Plan**
    *   The company's succession plan should be fair and capable [00:08:33].
3.  **Promoter's Salary Alignment with Profits**
    *   The promoter's salary should not be tangential to the company's profits; if profits decline, the promoter's salary should not increase [00:08:37].
4.  **Project Execution Skills**
    *   The company should demonstrate good project execution skills [00:08:45].
5.  **Dividends**
    *   Dividends should have consistently increased over time [00:08:50]. Most shortlisted companies, except for Sri Ganesh Remedies, showed increasing dividends per share [00:08:53].
6.  **Promoter Shareholding**
    *   A high promoter shareholding, preferably at least 51%, is considered positive [00:08:59]. This was the case for most of the 10 shortlisted companies [00:09:03].
7.  **Insider Buying**
    *   The promoter should be buying more shares in the company [00:09:07].
8.  **Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) Shareholding**
    *   A low FII shareholding (less than 20%) is preferred [00:09:13]. This was consistent across the 10 shortlisted companies [00:09:16].

## Valuation Metrics

The fourth and final category involves six different [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation metrics]]:

1.  **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Multiple)**
    *   This should be considered on both a historical basis (past P/E) and a comparative basis (against industry or sector P/E) [00:09:31].
2.  **PEG Ratio**
    *   Inspired by [[stock_selection_criteria_inspired_by_peter_lynch | Peter Lynch]], a PEG ratio above one indicates an overvalued company, while a ratio below one suggests undervaluation [00:09:47].
3.  **Earnings Yield**
    *   This number should be higher than the yield on a 10-year government bond, as it would not make sense to invest in equity otherwise [00:10:02]. At the time of recording, the 10-year paper yield was 7.17%, and few stocks met this threshold [00:10:13].
4.  **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Ratio)**
    *   Dr. Malik prefers companies where this number is less than one [00:10:32]. Unfortunately, none of the shortlisted companies had such a low price-to-book value [00:10:38].
5.  **Price to Sales Ratio**
    *   Drawing from James O'Shaughnessy, Dr. Malik suggests investing if the price-to-sales ratio is less than 1.5 and selling if it goes above three [00:10:44].
6.  **Dividend Yield**
    *   While a dividend yield of 5% is highly desirable, investors are advised not to focus too much on this number if the company is growing rapidly [00:11:05].

> [!TIP] Relaxing Valuation Parameters
> Dr. Malik advises that of the four categories (financial, business, management, and valuations), the valuation parameter can be relaxed slightly [00:11:40]. The first three categories help identify fundamentally strong companies, so even if the price becomes a bit expensive, it might just mean toning down return expectations [00:11:53].

This comprehensive checklist serves as a valuable starting point for [[investment_strategies_using_stock_screeners | identifying stocks]] using a standard screener [00:12:07].

[[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | Factor investing]] or [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | smart beta funds]] apply small adjustments to an [[performance_analysis_of_indian_index_funds | index investing]] strategy, aiming for significantly higher long-term returns compared to traditional [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]] indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These adjustments can potentially lead to a 5-10% increase in annual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## What is a Factor?
A factor is a specific characteristic or attribute found to influence the performance and returns of a stock or portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Factors are typically a package of attributes rather than isolated characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Traditional Index Funds
For a long time, major indices like the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]], Sensex, [[comparison_of_large_cap_and_small_cap_index_returns | Nifty mid cap 150]], and S&P 500 were primarily generated based on the relative size or market capitalization of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Smart Beta Funds (Factor Investing)
With improvements in computing power, many more factors have emerged, leading to the creation of [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | smart beta funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These funds are not named "Factor funds" but "[[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | smart beta funds]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

[[advantages_of_smart_beta_funds | Smart beta funds]] offer several advantages:
*   Passive style of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Transparent, rules-based methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   Broadly diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   Lower expense ratio compared to active funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>

The global [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | factor investing]] market has an AUM of $1.3 trillion, and [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | smart beta funds]] are expected to become a primary investment vehicle for millions of mutual fund investors in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Common Factors in Smart Beta Strategies
While factors like profitability, sales growth, sentiment analysis, human capital, cyber security, and social influence exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, the four most commonly used factors are:

1.  **Value Factor**: Identifies companies whose market price per share is lower than its intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. It uses variables such as P/E ratio, P/B ratio, price-to-sales, dividend yield, and buyback history to determine a value score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   Examples include the S&P BSE Value Index (uses Book value, P/E, Sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> and the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]] Value 20 fund (uses Return on Capital Employed, P/E, Price to Book, Dividend Yield) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   The Value 20 index has handsomely outperformed the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]] TRI over the last five years, at a lower volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. It made massive gains in 2020 and 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
2.  **Momentum Factor**: Based on the idea that stocks that have performed well in the past will continue to perform well in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This strategy requires constant adjustment of stocks over three, four, or six-month periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
    *   Examples include the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 and Nifty Mid Cap 150 Momentum 50 funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
    *   Over a five-year period, this strategy performed slightly better than the market cap-weighted [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]] index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. It works extremely well when stock markets are rising but shows weakness in bear markets (e.g., 2018, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
3.  **Quality Factor**: Generally refers to companies that are highly profitable, have a strong balance sheet, and little to no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   The S&P BSE Quality Index uses Return on Equity (ROE), balance sheet accruals ratio, and financial leverage ratio to calculate a quality score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   The Nifty offers multiple quality index options, including for the Mid Cap 150, Nifty 100, and Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. There can be wide variations in returns compared to the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
4.  **Low Volatility Factor**: An approach gaining popularity after the 2008 financial crisis, favoring defensive, less volatile stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Volatility is typically calculated as the standard deviation of a stock's daily price returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   The low volatility index keeps volatility lower than the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. While not always matching returns year-on-year, it offers similar returns to the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]] but at a lower level of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Performance Analysis
The performance position of factors continually changes based on economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Momentum and Value factors have frequently dominated performance charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   Momentum performs well during bull runs (e.g., 2014-2017, 2019, 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   Value takes charge during slippages and corrections (e.g., 2018, 2020, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

In comparison, the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]] TRI has generally been a poorer performer when stacked against these four factor indices, often ranking fourth or fifth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. There is often a sizeable difference between the top-ranked factor and the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]], sometimes as high as 10% to 29% in annual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## How to Invest in Factors
There are three main ways to invest in [[investment_opportunities_in_smart_beta_indices | smart beta strategies]]:

1.  **[[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | Mutual Funds]] and [[smart_beta_etf_strategies | Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)]]**: As of recently, there were 18 factor-based [[comparison_of_etfs_and_mutual_funds | mutual fund]] schemes and 22 [[smart_beta_etf_strategies | ETFs]], with numbers steadily increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
2.  **Investment Platforms**: Platforms like Smallcase offer numerous factor-based strategies, including momentum, quality, value, and multi-factor strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
3.  **Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Strategy**: For those with time and inclination, understanding the index creation methodology used by Nifty indices and S&P Global is a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This can be complex initially but can become a delightful activity with practice and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

It is important to remember that factors rotate, and no single factor is a guaranteed way to create wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Considering lump sum investments rather than only SIPs might help exploit the right factor at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | Factor-based investing]] is about defining and applying a set of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. By choosing the right factor at the right time, investors can potentially achieve up to 10% higher returns compared to the [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | Nifty 50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. [[investment_opportunities_in_smart_beta_indices | Smart beta strategies]] and [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | factor investing]] are seen as the future of [[performance_analysis_of_indian_index_funds | index investing]] and are likely to contribute significantly to future wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

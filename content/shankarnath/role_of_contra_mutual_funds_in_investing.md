## Understanding Contrarian Investing
As a general principle, following the crowd almost always works in everyday life, for instance, joining a line of people with the presumption they know why they are standing there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In investing, an [[approach to mutual fund selection | index fund]] is seen as the perfect "herd following mentality," where increasing amounts of money go into the same set of stocks in more or less the same proportion, irrespective of valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

However, common sense suggests doing the exact opposite: buying shares at the lowest price possible to maximize gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A low price typically occurs when other investors are selling the stock, which is the essence of a contrarian mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

A contrarian is defined as someone who opposes popular opinion, meaning they do not do what others are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This investing strategy emerged from the majority's behavioral tendency to under-react and then over-react to information, leading to exploitable mispricings in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. While a common misconception is that contrarians simply sell when others buy and vice versa, this is only one aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

A contrarian strategy is an excellent way to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns and diversify a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Practical Contrarian Strategies
Contrarian investors often employ specific strategies and techniques:

### 1. Portfolio of Losers
This technique involves intentionally investing in stocks that have performed poorly or experienced significant price declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A consensual definition of a "loser" stock is one that has dropped at least 40% in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

An analysis cited in Professor Ashwath Damodaran's book *Investment Fables* suggests that buying the 35 biggest losers over the previous year and holding them for five years could generate cumulative excess returns of 30% over the broader market, and an extra 40% compared to an investment in "winners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

An exercise for the Indian stock market, pulling the worst-performing stocks from two years prior to August 2018, showed that a portfolio of 35 such "loser" stocks delivered a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 91% over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Even after removing outliers (top and bottom four performers), a revised portfolio of 27 losers still yielded a five-year CAGR of 31%, an alpha of almost 20% annually compared to the Nifty's 11.7% growth during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This contrasts with a "winner's portfolio" which yielded a more placid 19% CAGR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The strategy operates on the principle of going against the crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, assuming that stocks with significant price declines may have been oversold due to short-term factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The expectation is a reversal of trends, making these stocks attractive again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### 2. Conviction Change (Analyst Recommendations)
This strategy involves trusting changes in equity analyst recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. A 2017 Motilal Oswal Securities report suggested that investing in stocks where analyst consensus shifted from a "net sell" to a "net buy" could deliver an annual return of 24.1% over a one-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This change in consensus is believed to be a robust return predictor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### 3. Sectoral Neglect and Business Cycles
Contrarians look for opportunities when certain sectors are neglected while others receive all the limelight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. For example, the Nifty Pharma index saw its P/E ratio drop from 53 to 24 within six months (April-October 2019) due to negative news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This presented an opportunity, as the investor community was overstating the risk, making the sector attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. During this period (March 2019-2020), while the Pharma index declined by 20%, its earnings per share (EPS) actually went up by about 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### 4. Investing in Under-owned and Underappreciated Companies
This strategy involves investing in something others are not looking at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. An example is Eicher Motors, which divested 13 of its 15 businesses between 2004 and 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. A contrarian might have seen a more focused company with a leaner structure, growing demand for retro-styled motorcycles, and improving operational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Contrarian investing challenges conventional market sentiments and includes early investments in growth companies when they are under-owned and underappreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, or when great businesses face temporary setbacks or negative news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### 5. High Dividend Yield Stocks
This strategy, exemplified by the "Dogs of the Dow" approach, involves investing in companies with the highest dividend yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The idea is that these stocks may be temporarily undervalued, offering attractive returns through dividend income and price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Indian examples include Coal India, ONGC, and Vedanta, which offer over 5% dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. These are often utilities or distressed companies with low P/E and price-to-book ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, though they might struggle with revenue growth or deliver negative stock price returns over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### 6. Investing at Maximum Pessimism
Contrarians view pessimism as a friend and euphoria as an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Sir John Templeton famously invested in Peru in 1985 during a period of economic stagnation (the "lost decade"), when the combined value of all Peruvian stocks was less than $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. He reasoned the country was at its point of maximum pessimism, leading to significant upside; the market rose 140 times over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some investors made substantial gains by investing in airline and hotel stocks when they faced significant declines due to travel restrictions, then rebounded as demand picked up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### 7. Differentiating Undervalued from Cheap using Metrics
Contrarians use metrics and screeners to differentiate between expensive and relatively cheaper stocks, examining price-to-earnings (P/E), PEG ratio, price-to-book value, and EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. It's a misconception that contrarians only invest in low P/E stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

*   **Cheap Company:** One that looks attractive purely from a metrics perspective (low P/E, high dividend yield, low price-to-book ratio), but may remain cheap permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Undervalued Opportunity:** A great business experiencing temporary headwinds, like Infosys in 2016 or Maruti Suzuki in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Investing in temporary setbacks of a great business is generally a better strategy than buying permanently cheap businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

## Contra Mutual Funds
For investors who prefer not to select individual stocks, [[quant_mutual_fund_investment_strategy | mutual funds]] can provide a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Contra and value funds are often grouped together.

### Performance and Characteristics
On a performance basis, Contra funds have generally outperformed most [[understanding_debt_mutual_funds_and_bond_investments | index funds]] and can be strong challengers to flexi-cap and multi-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

However, a deeper look reveals some interesting characteristics:
*   Most Contra funds, except possibly SBI Contra, hold over 70% of their assets in large-cap companies like HDFC Bank, Infosys, Reliance, and ICICI Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This raises questions about the degree of contrarian investing visible in their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   All three schemes typically have 59 or more stocks in their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, leading to questions about how different these actively managed Contra funds are from a larger mid-cap or even a flexi-cap fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Further Research
For more detailed insights, a report by Wisdom's research team provides a comprehensive analysis of how Contra [[strategies_for_enhancing_mutual_fund_returns | mutual funds]] are performing and their category positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This report includes comparisons of different Contra funds, research ratings for schemes, how the category differs from other equity MF categories, and a take on whether Contra funds deserve a place in an investor's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Conclusion: Why Be a Contrarian?
To beat the market, such as the Nifty 50, one generally needs to adopt a contrarian approach in some capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This requires a combination of patience, discipline, conviction, and superior research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. The benefits of a contrarian strategy include:
*   Higher portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>
*   Reduction in volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>
*   Less overreaction to market developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>
*   Better diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>

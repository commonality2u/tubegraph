The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has implemented a change regarding the use of credit cards for National Pension System (NPS) contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Key Details of the Change

*   **Effective Date** The new rule came into effect in August 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Applicability** Currently, this change is only applicable to [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | Tier 2 accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Contributions to [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | Tier 2 accounts]] cannot be made via credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Continued Use for Tier 1** Subscribers can still use their credit cards for making [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | Tier 1]] contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Rationale

This move aligns with broader trends where the use of credit cards for investing in mutual funds or stocks is generally discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Since a [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | Tier 2 account]] is considered similar to a mutual fund, this rule change was anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

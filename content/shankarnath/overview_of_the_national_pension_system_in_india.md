The National Pension System (NPS), often mistakenly referred to as the National Pension Scheme, is a voluntary defined contribution pension scheme initially introduced in 2004 and later extended to all Indian citizens in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Since its inception, the Assets Under Management (AUM) have grown significantly from 2,200 crores to nearly 9 lakh crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A substantial portion of this AUM belongs to Central and State Government employees, but over 30 lakh subscribers are part of the 'all citizen' category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. A recent handbook on NPS statistics revealed that most voluntary subscribers last year were in the 25-35 age group, and approximately 28% of them were women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Purpose and Benefits of NPS

While the term "pension" is prominent, the true purpose of [[overview_of_the_national_pension_system_in_india | NPS]] is to help citizens accumulate money for [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement]] that can then be converted into a post-retirement monthly payout, commonly known as pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

NPS offers several benefits to its subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>:
*   Low-cost structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   [[tax_benefits_and_withdrawal_rules_for_nps | Tax benefits]] for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Market-linked returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   Easy portability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   Professional management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>

## Eligibility and Account Operation

Any Indian citizen, including Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), aged between 18 and 65 years, can join the NPS program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. However, contributions made by NRIs are subject to regulatory requirements from the RBI and FEMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The following entities/individuals are *not* eligible to open an NPS account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>:
*   Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs) or Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Joint accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   Multiple NPS accounts by a single individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>

An NPS subscription operates similarly to a [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | mutual fund portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Subscribers open an account, decide on asset allocation (equity, debt, etc.), make regular contributions, and watch their portfolio grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. At [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement]], a portion of the money can be withdrawn, and the rest is used to set up an annuity for monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) oversees NPS with checks and balances provided by an NPS Trust, a Central Record Keeping Agency (CRA), and a custodian, similar to the structure of the Indian mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Types of NPS Accounts

There are two types of NPS accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>:

1.  **Tier 1 Account:** This is mandatory for all NPS subscribers and is referred to as the pension account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. It offers a host of tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
2.  **Tier 2 Account:** This is entirely optional and functions as a voluntary savings facility, often called the investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Tax benefits for Tier 2 are generally restricted to government employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Tier 2 accounts offer greater flexibility, allowing withdrawals at any point in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Subscribers can select different [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | investment patterns]] for each account type; for example, a debt-focused Tier 1 and an equity-focused Tier 2 are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Asset Classes and Investment Choices

NPS offers four asset classes for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>:

*   **Class E (Equity):** Money is invested in the stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Class G (Government Securities):** Includes bonds, T-bills, and various securities issued by central or state governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Class C (Corporate Debt):** Investments go towards bonds issued by Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), public financial institutions, infrastructure companies, and money market instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Class A (Alternative Investment Funds):** Includes commercial mortgage-backed securities, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The combination of these four asset classes significantly impacts the growth of an NPS corpus by [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement]] age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Subscribers have two options for [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | asset allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>:

1.  **Auto Choice:** Designed for investors who prefer not to make [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | asset allocation]] decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Funds are allocated based on a methodology-driven, life-cycle based approach, starting with an equity-heavy portfolio for younger subscribers that systematically rebalances to reduce equity exposure as they approach [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Subscribers choose from three life cycle funds:
    *   **Aggressive Life Cycle Fund:** Maximum equity allocation up to 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   **Moderate Life Cycle Fund:** Equity allocation up to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   **Conservative Option:** Equity allocation limited to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    The portfolio allocation is age-based and automatically optimized, with rebalancing occurring annually on the subscriber's date of birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
2.  **Active Choice:** For subscribers who wish to design their own portfolio and decide their [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | asset allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. While offering more freedom, it has conditions: maximum permissible equity allocation is 75%, and Class A (alternative investment funds) is capped at 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This option is available only to Tier 1 NPS investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Previously, there was an age-based condition to lower equity allocation after age 50, but this has been removed, allowing investors to keep 75% in equities until age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Subscribers can switch between Auto Choice and Active Choice once per financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Returns and Pension Fund Managers

NPS returns are market-linked and are not fixed like an FD or Provident Fund account; they depend on the performance of the pension fund manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Over a 10-year period, Class E (equities) has averaged around 13%, while government securities and corporate bonds have returned slightly over 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Class A schemes, available for the last five years, have clocked about 6% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Overall, NPS is estimated to have delivered returns in the range of 10-11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

The performance of Pension Funds within each category has been quite similar, often mirroring their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. For corporate bonds, NPS Class C funds have slightly outperformed the S&P BSE Corporate Bond Index, possibly due to their ability to invest in lower-rated (A paper) instruments up to 10% of the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. In equities, most NPS funds have a heavy large-cap bias, with at least 90% holdings in large-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Currently, there are 10 pension fund managers, including major institutions like SBI, HDFC, ICICI, and Axis, as well as life insurance-promoted managers like LIC Pension Fund and Max Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. While subscribers can have different pension managers for their Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts, they are *not* allowed to choose different fund managers for different schemes within the same tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This means a subscriber selects only one pension fund manager to manage all four asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. If desired, subscribers can change their pension fund manager once per financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## Opening and Maintaining an NPS Account

An NPS account can be opened physically or online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Offline:** Requires finding a "Point of Presence" (POP) such as a bank branch or post office, submitting an account opening form, KYC documents (identity/residence proof, passport-size photo), bank details, and nomination details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Online:** Faster, potentially in under 30 minutes, using Aadhaar, PAN, mobile number, and net banking account via enps.nstl.com or other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

Upon initial investment, a 12-digit Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN) is generated, making the NPS account highly portable across cities or employments (e.g., from central government to corporate sector) <a class="yt=" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

Minimum initial contributions are:
*   Tier 1: 500 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>
*   Tier 2: 1,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>

For a Tier 1 account, a subscriber is expected to invest at least 6,000 rupees per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Failure to meet this minimum or skipping payments will result in the account being frozen, requiring payment of the minimum contribution plus a 100-rupee penalty per year to unfreeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

Online services for NPS include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>:
*   Change of address (Aadhaar-based authentication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>
*   Scheme preferences modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>
*   Mobile number and email updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>
*   Online contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>
*   Viewing statement of holding and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>
*   Printing PRAN card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>
*   Registering grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>
*   Updating nominee details (up to three nominees, including spouse, children, dependent parents, with chosen distribution percentages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>

## Withdrawal and Exit Rules

Upon reaching 60 years of age, an NPS subscriber has three options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>:
1.  **Continue NPS with contributions** until age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
2.  **Continue NPS without further contributions** until age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
3.  **Exit NPS at age 60:** In this case, 60% of the corpus can be withdrawn as a lump sum, while the remaining 40% must be used to purchase an annuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. If no exit or deferment request is initiated, it's assumed the subscriber wishes to continue until age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Subscribers can exit anytime during this continuation period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

For premature withdrawals before age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>:
*   A subscriber can withdraw 20% of the corpus as a lump sum, with the remaining 80% used for an annuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   If the total corpus is less than 2.5 lakh rupees, the entire amount can be withdrawn prematurely without needing to purchase an annuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Partial withdrawals** are allowed under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>:
    *   After three years of regular contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
    *   Not more than 25% of one's own contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
    *   Limited to three times during the entire tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
    *   Reasons are limited to medical emergencies, a child's higher education or marriage, or the construction/purchase of a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
    *   All these partial withdrawals from Tier 1 accounts are tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

For Tier 2 withdrawals, there are no limits or conditions as seen with Tier 1, but there is ambiguity regarding how capital gains should be taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

## Annuities and Taxation

An annuity is a financial instrument where a lump sum payment is made to an insurance company, which then provides the purchaser (and their family) a fixed monthly income for a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Once purchased, the rate of return is locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | Annuities]] are also known as pensions in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | NPS rules]] mandate that at least 40% of the corpus must be used to buy an annuity from an annuity service provider (a life insurance company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

Common types of [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuities]] include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>:
*   **Life Annuity:** Provides a fixed monthly payment as long as the annuitant is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   **Joint Life Last Survivor Annuity:** Pays pension until the death of the annuitant, and then their spouse continues to receive the monthly annuity until their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. The monthly amount is typically lower due to two lives being involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.
*   **Variant with Corpus Return to Nominee:** The annuitant receives payment, then the spouse, and after both pass away, the original corpus amount is returned to the nominee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. This option typically results in an even lower monthly payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

NPS is often referred to as a "Triple E" (Exempt, Exempt, Exempt) instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>:
1.  **Contributions:** Qualify for [[tax_benefits_and_withdrawal_rules_for_nps | tax exemption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Employees are eligible for deductions under Section 80CCD(1) (up to 10% of basic + DA, max 1.5 lakh rupees), Section 80CCD(1B) (up to 50,000 rupees over the 1.5 lakh limit), and employer contributions (up to 10% of salary, or 14% if by central government) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. Employers also receive a [[tax_benefits_and_withdrawal_rules_for_nps | tax break]] as contributions are booked as a business cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
2.  **Returns:** The returns earned are exempt from capital gains or wealth tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
3.  **Withdrawals:**
    *   **Partial withdrawals:** Amounts up to 25% of the subscriber's contribution are exempt from taxes (as per Budget 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
    *   **Death of subscriber before maturity:** The entire corpus withdrawn by the nominee is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
    *   **Exit before age 60:** 20% of the lump sum withdrawal is tax-free; the remaining 80% received as an annuity payout is taxable as per income tax rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.
    *   **At [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement]] (age 60):** Up to 60% of the corpus withdrawn as a lump sum is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. The remaining 40% used for annuity purchase results in subsequent pension payouts being taxable as per the investor's income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. It's important to consider that one's tax slab may be lower or zero during [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

NPS addresses two key parts of [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement planning]]: the accumulation phase (consistent contributions and [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | asset allocation]]) and the post-[[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement]] phase (selecting the right [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] plan and provider for monthly income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

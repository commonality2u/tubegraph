While investors can choose to build a [[stepbystep_guide_to_building_a_coffee_can_investing_portfolio | coffee can investing portfolio]] themselves, professional help is available for those without the time or inclination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:54">[07:07:54]</a>.

## Portfolio Management Services (PMS) Companies

Several PMS companies offer portfolios that align with the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can investment strategy]]. These services generally require a minimum investment of at least 50 lakh rupees, which may make them unsuitable for most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:07">[09:42:07]</a>.

### Ambit Asset Management

Ambit Asset Management has offered a [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can portfolio]] since March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:21">[07:25:21]</a>.
Key characteristics of Ambit's portfolio include:
*   **Holdings**: It typically contains 10 to 15 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:44">[07:28:44]</a>.
*   **Bias**: The portfolio has a large-cap bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:26">[07:30:26]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings**: The top five holdings often consist of Asian Paints, ICICI Bank, TCS, HDFC Bank, and Pidilite Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:14">[07:33:14]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Ambit's [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can portfolio]] has shown a P/E (Price-to-Earnings) ratio of 74, significantly higher than the Nifty 50's P/E multiple of 21. This high P/E ratio may indicate that the investing community anticipates higher future earnings growth for these companies, suggesting they are valued more highly by investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:19">[07:54:19]</a>.

### Marcellus

Marcellus, headed by Chief Investment Officer Saurabh Mukherjee, is another PMS associated with the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:37">[08:37:37]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Name**: Instead of "coffee can portfolio," Marcellus names its flagship offering the "Consistent Compounders portfolio" (CCP), which draws heavily from the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:03">[08:44:03]</a>.
*   **Selection Process**: The Marcellus team employs its own rigorous process of filters, forensic accounting, and channel feedback to build a final portfolio of 12 to 15 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:07">[08:57:07]</a>.
*   **Reported Top Holdings**: According to a Moneycontrol article, the top holdings for this portfolio include Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Titan, Dr Lal Path Labs, and HDFC Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:44">[09:23:44]</a>.

## Other Platforms and Resources

### Mutual Funds and Smallcase

A search across over a thousand mutual fund schemes did not reveal any explicitly carrying the phrase "coffee can" or "consistent compounders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:16">[09:52:16]</a>. Similarly, searches on Smallcase for a coffee can portfolio came up empty-handed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:30">[10:04:30]</a>.

### User-Generated Portfolios and Community Resources

*   **Screener.in**: This platform hosts over 4,000 user-generated [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can portfolios]], each with unique additional parameters like net profit margin, sales quantum, and P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:20">[10:24:20]</a>. However, screeners may have limitations; for instance, they might not directly support checking for a minimum 10% growth in *each* of the last 10 years, requiring workarounds like identifying a 10% sales growth across multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:12">[10:46:12]</a>.
*   **Forums and Social Media**: Platforms like Valuepickr and Twitter offer spaces where individuals share their knowledge and opinions on stocks, including those suitable for [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:40">[11:05:40]</a>. Gurjot Ahluwalia, for example, shares a process using a screener with additional filters for:
    *   3, 5, and 7-year sales growth of at least 10% to eliminate cyclical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:23">[11:24:23]</a>.
    *   Similar multi-year filters for Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:07">[11:42:07]</a>.
    *   Blindly filtering out cyclical or commodity-based sectors (e.g., steel, sugar, metals, infrastructure, power, capital goods, real estate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:09">[12:10:09]</a>.
    *   Excluding PSU businesses and sectors with high regulatory control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:43">[12:29:43]</a>.
    *   Applying further filters such as:
        *   Debt-to-equity ratio less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:08">[12:43:08]</a>.
        *   Unpledged promoter holding of at least 40% to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:15">[12:49:15]</a>.
        *   Reviewing corporate governance track record, including any SEBI violations, fines, or criminal cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:46">[13:00:46]</a>.
    This filtering process aims to narrow down the initial list of over 100 stocks to 25-35 excellent businesses, with a final check on current valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:35">[13:12:35]</a>.

## Summary of Coffee Can Investing

The [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can investment strategy]] involves finding high-quality stocks and holding them for extended periods, typically outperforming benchmarks across economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:36">[13:34:36]</a>. However, it often requires significant initial research and analysis to ensure the selection of appropriate stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:05">[14:06:05]</a>. A potential drawback is that it might miss out on catching new companies and industries in their nascent stages, potentially missing huge multi-baggers, as it focuses on businesses with over 10 years of operational history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:09">[13:49:09]</a>.

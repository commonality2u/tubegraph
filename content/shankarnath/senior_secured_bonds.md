Senior secured bonds are a type of fixed-income product offered as an alternative to traditional investments like corporate bonds or bank fixed deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. These bonds are designed to offer pre-tax returns ranging from 11% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, with the specific example discussed yielding an XIRR of 9.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This contrasts with traditional fixed income options that typically offer returns in the 6% to 8% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. These products are not linked to the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Key Characteristics

The terms "senior" and "secured" define the structure of these bonds:
*   **Secured** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>: The bond is backed by collateral, such as a property, an asset, or a pool of loans (e.g., vehicle and SME loans from an NBFC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This collateral provides a layer of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Senior** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>: Bondholders have a higher priority for repayment in the event that the NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company) defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This provides another layer of security through prioritized repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

Platforms like Wind Wealth, Bond Scott, and Altify facilitate investment in these bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. For instance, Wind Wealth has offered senior secured bonds by SK Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Example Investment
An example investment mentioned involves putting in 1,06,000 rupees and receiving 1,21,265 rupees (principal plus interest) at maturity on April 5, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This translates to an XIRR of 9.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

Platforms provide additional information to help investors assess the likelihood of getting their money back, including the NBFC's history and track record, news clippings, assessments of leverage and credit rating, potential red flags, and financials. The collateral size is also an important metric provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Risks Associated with Senior Secured Bonds

Despite their "secured" and "senior" nature, these bonds carry four main risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>:

*   **Credit Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>: The principal and interest are not guaranteed if the NBFC defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>: Investors might struggle to find a buyer if they wish to sell the bond before maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Fraud Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>: This includes the possibility of the NBFC providing false information or the platform itself engaging in fraudulent activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Market Risk (Market Linked Debentures - MLDs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>: These instruments are [[Strategies for diversifying bond investment risk|market-linked debentures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, meaning their returns can be tied to a specific market variable. For instance, the MLD for SK Finance bonds is linked to the yield of a particular [[Investment in government bonds for retirees|government of India bond]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. If this yield crosses a certain threshold (e.g., 24%) at maturity, the investor might only receive the principal amount without any interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. While the chances of this happening might be low, the risk is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

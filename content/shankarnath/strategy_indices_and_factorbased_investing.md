Strategy indices, also known as [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | factor-based indices]] or [[investment_opportunities_in_smart_beta_indices | smart beta funds]], represent an approach to passive investing that goes beyond traditional market capitalization weighting schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19">[08:19]</a>. These indices are based on specific characteristics or "factors" that have historically shown to drive investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28">[08:28]</a>.

## Overview of Strategy Indices
A strategy index is constructed based on certain characteristics that extend beyond the traditional market cap basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28">[08:28]</a>. These characteristics include various [[overview_of_common_factors_in_investing | factors]] such as momentum, quality, value, alpha, and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35">[08:35]</a>.

Nifty Indices Limited, an index construction company, has developed a range of indices, including those based on strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22">[01:22]</a>. As of a recent count, there are 35 active schemes representing strategy indices available for investors in India, a number that is consistently growing with Asset Management Companies (AMCs) adding 7 to 8 [[factorbased_investing | factor-based funds]] each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41">[08:41]</a>.

## Performance and Cyclicality
Different [[overview_of_common_factors_in_investing | factors]] within strategy indices perform differently at various times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52">[08:52]</a>. While tactical investing is possible, certain strategies have demonstrated better long-term performance over 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55">[08:55]</a>.

*   **Momentum Indices**: The Nifty 200 Momentum 30 and the Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 indices have performed exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04">[09:04]</a>.
*   **Alpha Indices**: The Nifty Alpha 50 index, which selects 50 high-alpha stocks using Jensen's measure, has been a top performer on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16">[09:16]</a>.

It's important to note that the performance of a strategy index can vary significantly year by year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25">[09:25]</a>. For example, certain strategy indices showed strong performance in 2014, 2017, 2020, 2021, and 2023, while performing worse than market cap-based indices in other years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33">[09:33]</a>.

### Multi-Factor Strategies
Some strategies are not dependent on a single factor but combine multiple factors, such as alpha and low volatility, or momentum and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44">[09:44]</a>. Investors can explore the methodology documents on the Nifty Indices website for detailed information on single or multi-factor strategies, including their concepts, variables, universe of stocks, and selection criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56">[09:56]</a>.

## Comparison with Market-Cap Based Indices
When comparing strategy-based indices with their market-cap based counterparts (e.g., Nifty 200 Momentum 30 vs. Nifty 200; Nifty 50 Value 20 vs. Nifty 50) over the long run, most strategy indices have outperformed traditional market cap-based indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15">[10:15]</a>. Exceptions were noted for two quality indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40">[10:40]</a>. This suggests that fans of Nifty 50 or even Nifty Small Cap 250 indices might consider the benefits of strategy indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49">[10:49]</a>.

## Selecting Strategy Indices for a Portfolio
Based on performance and strategic representation, the following strategy indices are highlighted as potential picks for a diversified portfolio:
*   Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00">[11:00]</a>
*   Nifty Alpha 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04">[11:04]</a>
*   Nifty Small Cap 250 Quality 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07">[11:07]</a>

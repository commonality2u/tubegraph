Ambit Capital has developed a "10 Bagger Portfolio" strategy that identifies companies with the potential for significant growth. This portfolio has achieved an annualized return of 22% over the last 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The core of this strategy is the "Greatness Framework," which evaluates a company's structural strengths using various [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metrics]] and ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## The Greatness Framework: Six Foundational Blocks

The framework, initially compiled by Gaurav Mehta and Saurabh Mukherjee in 2012, has evolved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. It focuses on how a company consistently improves its structural strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. These six factors are equally weighted to calculate a "greatness score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Financial institutions like banks, NBFCs, and insurance companies are excluded from this framework, which typically results in more manufacturing, IT, pharma, and services companies on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

The six key areas of evaluation include:

### 1. Investment (Incremental Capex)
This metric assesses a company's commitment to growth by examining improvements in its capital expenditure to depreciation ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Ambit calculates this over a six-year period, comparing the recent three years to the past three years to normalize results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Balakrishna Industries, Coromandel International, and Page Industries have shown increased capital allocation for manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### 2. Efficiency in Translating Investment into Sales
This factor measures how effectively a firm converts its investments into sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. While earlier versions considered the asset turnover ratio and sales growth, recent presentations focus on incremental sales growth measured against its standard deviation to ensure performance consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Deepak Nitrite, Gland Pharma, and SRF Limited have demonstrated substantial sales increases from FY 2020-22 compared to FY 2017-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### 3. Efficiency in Capital Employed
This measures the improvement in the capital employed turnover ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. It is calculated by dividing the company's sales by its average capital employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This is distinct from Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

### 4. Pricing Discipline
This refers to the improvement and consistency of a company's PBIT (Profit Before Interest and Tax) margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Ambit looks at margin growth over a six-year period and measures consistency against the standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### 5. Balance Sheet Discipline
This factor examines a company's de-leverage ratio, specifically how much the debt-to-equity ratio has been reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

### 6. Cash Generation and Profitability Improvement
This metric assesses the increase in a company's cash flow from operations and its consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** Persistent Systems, which received a greatness score of 100, showed significant jumps in cash flow from operations alongside higher capex and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of "Great Companies"

Ambit's 2023 presentation outlines specific targets for "great companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>:
*   **Sales Growth:** At least 15% over the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   **Cash Flow from Operations Growth:** At least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.
*   **PAT (Profit After Tax) Growth:** At least 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
*   **ROC (Return on Capital):** 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.

## [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | Valuation Metrics]] for Investment Decisions

Beyond structural strength, [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | evaluating stock market metrics for investment decisions]] also requires determining if the current market price makes a stock attractive. Ambit's model addresses this by examining a company's current [[evaluating_stocks_using_peg_and_pe_ratios | P/E ratio]], Price-to-Book (PB) ratio, and EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. If these current [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation metrics]] are below their historical five-year averages, the stock is considered "cheap and attractively priced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

*   **Attractively Valued (as of Feb 10, 2023):** Ultratech, Dr. Reddy's, Gland Pharma, Indiamart, CAMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   **Deemed Expensive (as of Feb 10, 2023):** SRF, Balakrishna Industries, Tata ELXSI, Persistent Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Revisions and Consistency

The 10 Bagger framework is not a "set it and forget it" strategy. Portfolio revisions are made annually, and investors need to continuously seek new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. Over many iterations, only about 35% of companies continue to qualify for the list over the subsequent two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

Despite this, the portfolio has consistently outperformed the BSE 500, BFSI index, and top-performing flexi-cap funds in most years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

### Consistent Performers
Of over 100 companies identified by the framework, only five have been consistent "10 baggers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>:
*   Nestle India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>
*   Hindalco Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>
*   Abbott India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>
*   Page Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>
*   Tata ELXSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>

## Key Steps for Applying the Model

When using a [[stock_screening_platforms_and_financial_metrics | stock screening platform]] with modifications, consider these 10 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>:

1.  **Incremental Capital Expenditure:** Companies increasing their capex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
2.  **Sales Growth:** Consistent growth in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
3.  **Efficient Capital Use:** Generating revenue efficiently with capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.
4.  **Improving Profit Margins:** Firms showing improving profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
5.  **Decreasing Debt-Equity Ratio:** Companies reducing their debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
6.  **Increasing Cash Flow from Operations & Profitability:** Growth in cash flow from operations alongside profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.
7.  **Consistency Check:** All points must be checked for consistency over two three-year blocks, factoring in standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
8.  **Dividend Reinvestment:** Assume any received dividends are reinvested on the ex-dividend date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
9.  **[[management_analysis_for_stock_investment | Accounting and Governance Check]]:** Filter out companies with corporate governance issues, dodgy auditor reports, or high promoter share pledging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. This relates to a broader [[analysis_of_financial_statements | analysis of financial statements]] to identify red flags.
10. **Attractive [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | Valuation]]:** Select stocks that are attractively valued compared to their historical valuations, using P/E, PB, and EV/EBITDA ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

This framework provides a structured approach for [[evaluating_stocks_using_peg_and_pe_ratios | evaluating stocks using PEG and PE ratios]] and other [[business_operations_metrics_in_stock_analysis | business operations metrics in stock analysis]] for long-term investment.

The [[financial_independence_and_early_retirement_fire_method | Financial Independence, Early Retirement (FIRE) method]] is a program designed around saving aggressively, investing in high-return instruments, and disciplined withdrawals to ensure enough money to cover living expenses for the rest of one's life, enabling early retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The concept was popularized by the book "Your Money or Your Life" and emphasizes self-sufficiency, control over time, moderate consumption, and living life outside traditional work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Core Saving Principles
A fundamental step in implementing a [[financial_independence_and_early_retirement_fire_method | FIRE strategy]] is savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Hardcore adherents of [[financial_independence_and_early_retirement_fire_method | FIRE]] aim to save anywhere from 50% to 70% of their monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. However, savings need not always be defined as a percentage; absolute numbers can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The [[financial_independence_and_early_retirement_fire_method | FIRE strategy]] encourages individuals to find creative ways to increase their savings rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Increasing Income
While reducing expenses is a common approach to saving, increasing one's income offers a much longer runway for wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Strategies for boosting income include:
*   Taking a part-time job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   Doing consultancy work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   Asking for a pay hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   Changing jobs for a better salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
*   Reskilling oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   Starting a side hustle, which can be a mix of active and passive work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

One example highlights a data scientist who increased monthly savings from 50,000 Rupees to over 2 lakhs a month by also teaching on an edtech platform and doing consultancy work on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Spending Wisely
The second step in the [[financial_independence_and_early_retirement_fire_method | FIRE strategy]] focuses on [[wise_spending_principles_under_fire | wise spending]] rather than a complete halt to spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This involves distinguishing between essential and discretionary expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Practical tips from [[financial_independence_and_early_retirement_fire_method | FIRE]] practitioners include:
*   Driving a good used car instead of a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
*   Renting versus buying a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
*   Cooking at home instead of eating out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>
*   Tracking daily expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Canceling unnecessary subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>

These small adjustments can potentially reduce monthly expenses by up to 30%, which is comparable to receiving a 30% salary increment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The emphasis is on being rational with expenses rather than stingy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## The Three Pillars of [[financial_independence_and_early_retirement_fire_method | FIRE]]
In summary, the [[financial_independence_and_early_retirement_fire_method | FIRE]] approach relies on three simple principles:
1.  Save more (often by increasing income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
2.  Spend less (wisely) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
3.  [[investment_approaches_in_the_fire_strategy | Invest wisely]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>

Adopting these [[strategies for building a large financial corpus | strategies for building a large financial corpus]] can profoundly impact one's financial life positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While the savings targets can seem daunting, the [[financial_independence_and_early_retirement_fire_method | FIRE method]] is flexible and can be adapted to individual circumstances, often through tools like a customized [[planning expenses and investment for early retirement | FIRE calculator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Evolution of Payment Methods

Initially, all National Pension System (NPS) contributions were made via net banking, utilizing methods such as IMPS, NEFT, and RTGS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

In 2020, the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) was introduced as a payment option, allowing contributions of up to 2,000 rupees in a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Further improvements were made in 2022, enabling subscribers to use a UPI handle for contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

However, this method was not always convenient, as the virtual account number differed from the Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN), and separate numbers were required for [[eligibility_and_account_types_in_nps | Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This highlighted the need for a simpler and more efficient contribution method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Introduction of QR Codes

In December of the previous year, the regulator introduced the ability to make contributions via QR codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This allows investors to quickly generate a personalized QR code for their [[eligibility_and_account_types_in_nps | Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts]] and then use any UPI-enabled application to contribute by scanning these codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Benefits of the New System

The improved QR code process offers several advantages:
*   **Faster and Easier:** It streamlines the contribution process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Reduced Errors:** It minimizes the likelihood of errors or mistakes during transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

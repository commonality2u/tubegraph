[[FactorBased Investing | Factor-based investing]] allows for small adjustments to an [[introduction_to_factor_investing | index investing]] strategy that can lead to significant long-term returns, potentially increasing annual returns by 5-10% compared to traditional indices like the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This approach can make a plain Index Fund more powerful and profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

A "factor" is a specific characteristic or attribute found to influence the performance and returns of a stock or portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While traditionally indices were based on company size (like the Nifty 50 or S&P 500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, increased computing power has led to the emergence of many more factors, including profitability, sales growth, sentiment analysis, human capital, cybersecurity, and even social influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Generally, a factor is not an isolated characteristic but often a package of attributes. For example, the value factor identifies companies whose market price per share is lower than their intrinsic value, using variables like P/E ratio, P/B ratio, price-to-sales, dividend yield, and buyback history to calculate a value score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

These [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | factor-based]] approaches are often referred to as [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | smart beta funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. They offer advantages such as a passive investing style, a transparent rules-based methodology, a broadly diversified portfolio, and lower expense ratios compared to active funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The global [[factor_investing_and_its_impact_on_portfolio_returns | factor investing]] market has an AUM of $1.3 trillion, and it's expected that [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | smart beta funds]] will become a primary investment vehicle for millions of mutual fund investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Methods for Investing in Factor-Based Strategies

There are three primary ways to invest in [[factorbased_investing | factor-based]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>:

### 1. Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
This is a straightforward way to gain exposure to [[factorbased_investing | factor-based]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. As of a recent update, there were 18 [[factorbased_investing | factor-based]] mutual fund schemes and 22 exchange-traded funds available, a number that has been consistently growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### 2. Investment Platforms (e.g., Smallcase)
Platforms like Smallcase offer numerous [[factorbased_investing | factor-based]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. These include:
*   Momentum strategies offered by firms like Capitalmind, Right Research, Weekend Investing, and Windmill Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   Strategies focused on the quality factor and the value factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   Multi-factor strategies, such as one named "multi-factor Dynamic quantitative algo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### 3. Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Strategy
For those with the time and inclination, a DIY approach to [[factor_investing_and_its_impact_on_portfolio_returns | factor investing]] is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. If lacking time or interest, paying the typical half-percent expense ratio to a mutual fund for management is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

To pursue a DIY strategy, a good starting point is to understand the index creation methodology used by Nifty Indices and S&P Global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. While it may seem complicated initially, practice and automation can make it a rewarding activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Successful DIY models could even be listed on platforms like Smallcase, attracting subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Factor Investing

*   **Factor Rotation**: Factors rotate in performance over time, and no single factor guarantees wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. For instance, momentum tends to perform well during bull markets, while value gains prominence during corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Lump Sum Investments**: To best exploit factors, consider using lump sum investments to enter the right factor at the right time, rather than solely relying on Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This contrasts with general advice to consistently invest via SIPs, but in the context of factor rotation, lump sums can be strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

At its core, [[factorbased_investing | factor-based investing]] involves defining and applying a set of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. With careful selection of the right factor at the opportune moment, investors could potentially achieve returns up to 10% higher than the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. [[factorbased_investing | Smart beta strategies]] and [[factor_investing_and_its_impact_on_portfolio_returns | factor investing]] are seen as the future of [[introduction_to_factor_investing | index investing]], likely contributing significantly to future wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

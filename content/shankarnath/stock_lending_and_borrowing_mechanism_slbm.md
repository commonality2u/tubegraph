The Stock Lending and Borrowing Mechanism (SLBM) represents a third method for generating income from stocks, in addition to dividends and capital gains [00:00:10]. It functions similarly to renting out a house, but with stocks [00:00:15]. SLBM is a temporary arrangement where a lender advances securities to a borrower for a specified duration in exchange for a fee [00:00:37].

While globally popular, SLBM has yet to make a significant impact in India, despite being available for over a decade [00:00:45]. This legally approved system for lending and borrowing securities was initially established in 1997 as the Securities Lending Scheme [00:00:55].

## [[participants_and_process_of_slbm | Understanding SLBM through an Analogy]]

To simplify the concept, imagine owning a car that sits idle during weekdays while you are at work [00:01:11]. A friend proposes to use your car as a taxi during the day, returning it in the evening with a daily rental fee [00:01:27]. This arrangement ensures full utilization of the asset, provides extra cash for you, and income for your friend [00:01:42]. In its simplest form, this is what SLBM accomplishes [00:01:51].

## [[participants_and_process_of_slbm | Participants in SLBM]]

There are three primary participants in any SLBM process:
*   **Lender** The individual or entity holding shares in their Demat account [00:01:57].
*   **Borrower** The individual or entity seeking to use the shares temporarily [00:02:04].
*   **Exchange** The regulating body responsible for ensuring the transaction occurs properly and adheres to rules [00:02:08].

Anyone, including insurance companies, banks, short sellers, fund houses, High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs), and even retail investors, can participate as a borrower or lender [00:03:01].

## [[participants_and_process_of_slbm | The SLBM Process]]

The typical SLBM process involves several steps:
1.  **Registration** Both the lender and the borrower register themselves with the exchange, usually facilitated through stockbrokers [00:02:14].
2.  **Agreement of Terms** The borrower and lender mutually agree upon the loan terms, including tenure, interest rate, and other conditions [00:02:24].
3.  **Collateral Placement** The borrower places collateral for the borrowed stocks, a process facilitated by the exchange [00:02:33].
4.  **Share Transfer** The agreed number of shares are transferred from the lender's Demat account to the borrower's [00:02:39].
5.  **Return and Payment** On the stipulated date and according to contract terms, the borrower returns the stocks and pays the agreed-upon fee to the lender [00:02:44].
6.  **Fee Distribution** From this fee, the intermediary takes their brokerage, the exchange also earns a portion, and the remaining amount is credited to the lender's bank account [00:02:50].

### Example of SLBM in Practice

Consider a scenario where Person A owns 5,000 shares of a company. Mr. B, a short seller, approaches Person A to borrow these shares for one month, making A the lender and B the borrower [00:03:14]. They agree on a lending fee of 1% of the share value [00:03:29].

The 5,000 shares are transferred from A's Demat account to B's [00:03:37]. Mr. B sells these shares at the market price of 100 rupees, anticipating a price drop within 30 days [00:03:42]. Person A, a long-term investor, is unconcerned by short-term price fluctuations, expecting the share price to rise significantly in the future [00:03:50].

As Mr. B expected, the share price drops to 90 rupees by month-end [00:04:02]. A pleased Mr. B buys back the 5,000 shares at 90 rupees, realizing a profit of 50,000 rupees [00:04:11]. He then returns the borrowed shares to Person A and pays the 1% lending fee (5,000 rupees) [00:04:19]. This leaves Mr. B with a net profit of 45,000 rupees [00:04:26]. In this scenario, both the lender and borrower profit [00:04:31].

## [[benefits_and_risks_of_slbm | Benefits of SLBM]]

SLBM offers multiple benefits:
*   **Market Liquidity** It enhances market liquidity, benefiting all stock market participants [00:04:46].
*   **Efficient Short Selling** It facilitates a more efficient short selling operation, which aids in price discovery [00:04:53].
*   **Risk Management** It helps traders manage risk through hedging or by gaining exposure to assets without direct ownership [00:04:59].
*   **Risk-Free Returns for Lenders** For investors, it's a way to earn relatively risk-free returns on idle stock assets [00:05:09].
*   **No Counterparty Risk** Transactions are guaranteed by the Clearing Corporation, eliminating counterparty risk for lenders [00:10:27].
*   **Entitlement to Corporate Actions** Lenders remain entitled to corporate actions like dividends and stock splits during the lending period [00:10:33].
*   **Taxation Perspective** SLB segment transactions are not treated as transfer or sale of securities, which offers benefits from a taxation perspective [00:10:40].

### Opportunities for Borrowers

Borrowers typically utilize SLBM for three main opportunities:
1.  **Short Selling** If a borrower anticipates a share price drop, they can borrow the stock via SLBM, short it, wait for the price to fall, buy it back, return the shares, and profit [00:08:20].
2.  **Stock Price Arbitrage** If a share's price differs across two exchanges, borrowers can use SLBM to capitalize on the difference for quick gains [00:08:40].
3.  **Covering Short Positions** Borrowers often use SLBM to cover their short positions, preventing settlement failures [00:08:48].

## Features of SLBM Contracts

*   **Tenure** An SLBM contract can range from one month to 12 months [00:05:21]. For example, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) website typically shows options up to 12 months out [00:05:26].
*   **Eligible Stocks** Over 600 stocks qualify under the SLBM framework, including many A-group stocks. This list is updated monthly on the NSE website [00:05:41].
*   **Expiry** SLBM contracts expire on the first Thursday of every month [00:05:57]. This differs from F&O (Futures & Options) contracts, which expire on the last Thursday of the month [00:06:03].
    *   For example, a contract initiated on August 8th for September 2023 would have a tenure until September 7th (the first Thursday of September), making it a 30-day contract [00:06:09]. If initiated on August 20th, the tenure would be 19 days [00:06:27].
    *   The highest liquidity is typically found in the most recent one or two-month contracts, with volumes decreasing rapidly for longer tenures [00:06:33].
*   **Minimum Order Value** Minimum order value requirements vary by brokerage [00:06:45]. For instance, Zerodha requires a minimum order value of 1 lakh rupees per security for lenders and at least 500 shares for borrowers [00:06:48]. Other brokers like Motilal Oswal Securities and HDFC Securities may have no such limitations [00:07:00].

## Guarantee and [[benefits_and_risks_of_slbm | Risks]]

The exchange plays a crucial role in validating, clearing, settling, and guaranteeing SLBM transactions [00:07:08]. This is done by the National Securities Clearing Corporation of India (a subsidiary of NSE) or the BSE-owned Indian Clearing Corporation Limited [00:07:20].

A Clearing Corporation acts as a guarantor by requiring the borrower to put up a margin of 125% of the value of the borrowed stocks [00:07:32]. This significantly protects the lender [00:07:43]. However, complete safety is not 100% guaranteed due to the potential for **closeout risk** [00:07:48]. This occurs when the borrower fails to return the shares by the agreed time or upon demand [00:07:51]. Information on the frequency of closeout risk situations is not readily available [00:07:59].

## Repay and Recall Options

*   **Repay Option (Borrower)** A borrower can return shares earlier than the stipulated settlement period [00:08:57]. If the repay offer matches a pending order based on the current market price, the repay order is executed, shares are returned, and the exchange reverses the margin amount back to the borrower [00:09:03].
*   **Recall Option (Lender)** Similarly, lenders can request their shares back earlier by placing a recall order with the exchange [00:10:55]. Once the offer is matched, the recall order is executed, and shares are returned to the lender [00:11:07].

## Interest Rate Calculation

To calculate the interest rate for SLBM, one needs to identify the lending and borrowing rates from the SLB page on the NSE website (under Market Data > Securities Lending and Borrowing) [00:11:15]. For individual lenders, Series B contracts are typically chosen [00:11:30].

For example, if for Bata India, a borrower is willing to pay 8 rupees per share for 116 shares [00:11:40], and the closing share price is 1756 rupees [00:12:03], the direct yield is 0.46% (8 / 1756) [00:12:10]. Annualizing this yield for a 30-day tenure (0.46% * 365 / 30) results in an annualized yield of 5.4% [00:12:13]. This means a lender of Bata India shares could earn an additional 5.4% on top of dividends and capital appreciation [00:12:25]. The median one-month SLB opportunity yield observed is about 1.5%, but this can be significantly higher for some stocks at certain times [00:12:35]. It is advisable to consult a stockbroker's relationship manager for current opportunities [00:12:48].

## Corporate Actions and SLBM

Lenders remain the owners of their shares and are therefore entitled to dividends, bonuses, buybacks, and other corporate actions, even when their shares are lent out [00:13:03].
*   **Bonus Issue, Rights Issue, Buyback** Open SLB positions will be foreclosed. The exchange handles the return of shares and the pro-rata application of lending fees [00:13:17].
*   **Dividends** The lender does not need to take any action; the exchange will recover the dividend amount from the borrower and transfer it to the lender's savings account [00:13:29].
*   **Stock Splits** The exchange will adjust the quantity and transfer the correct number of shares to the lender's Demat account [00:13:39].

## [[charges_and_taxation_related_to_slbm_transactions | Charges and Taxation]]

As per current norms:
*   There are no Securities Transaction Tax (STT) charges [00:13:48].
*   There are no [[sebis_role_in_the_stock_market | SEBI]] turnover charges [00:13:52].
*   There is no stamp duty [00:13:54].
*   There are no transaction charges on any SLB trades [00:13:57].

### Taxation

When shares move between Demat accounts in an SLBM transaction, it is not considered a transfer or a sale, meaning no capital gains taxes are payable [00:14:02]. However, the lending fee received by the lender is typically categorized as "income from other sources" [00:14:11]. This income is added to the lender's total taxable income and taxed according to their individual income tax slab [00:14:15].

### Commission

Commission rates for SLBM vary among brokerages [00:14:22]. For instance, Zerodha charges 20% of the lending fees, while Kotak Securities and HDFC Securities charge 15% [00:14:27]. The brokerage is paid on the lending fees earned, not on the underlying transaction value [00:14:41]. For example, if a lender earns 80,000 rupees in lending fees, a 15% commission (12,000 rupees) plus 18% GST (2,160 rupees) would be deducted, resulting in a net fee of 65,840 rupees credited to the lender's account [00:14:55].

To participate in the SLB segment, most brokerages support it, typically requiring clients to contact their relationship manager as transactions are often handled offline [00:15:21].

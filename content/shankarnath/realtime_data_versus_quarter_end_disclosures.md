In the realm of investment strategies, the timing and source of data play a crucial role in the effectiveness of "copycat" or "shameless cloning" methodologies. A significant improvement in investment strategy involves shifting from quarterly disclosures to real-time data for tracking prominent investors' moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Original Cloning Strategy: Quarter-End Disclosures

The initial "shameless cloning" strategy, as detailed in an earlier video, involved identifying around 10 market investors and focusing on companies where they held at least 1% of outstanding shares as of December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This approach relied on quarter-end disclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

However, a major drawback of this method was the time lag; by the time an investor's buy or sell action was disclosed at quarter-end, it could be a month or two before the information became processable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Additionally, the strategy was limited to the 1% shareholding rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. Despite these limitations, the original strategy yielded an annualized return of 41.4% during a bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

### Revised Strategy: Embracing Real-time Data

To address the shortcomings of the original method, a revised copycat investing strategy was developed, featuring two major changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. The first key change was an overhaul of the data acquisition method, moving from quarter-end disclosures to the use of real-time data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

This means that buying information is now tracked as it is reported to the exchange on the same day or, at best, the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. For instance, if an investor like Mr. Madus and Kala buys a significant number of shares, such as 9.5 lakh shares of SG Finserve, this information is used immediately, unlike the previous version which would wait for a quarter-end declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

Sources for this real-time data include screening platforms like Ticker Tape, the NSE website, and other financial apps and websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

#### Types of Large Volume Transaction Disclosures Tracked:

The revised strategy specifically tracks various large volume transaction disclosures to capture real-time movements by prominent investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>:

*   **Bulk Deal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>: An investor buys or sells at least 0.5% of a company's total shares in a single trading session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **Block Deal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>: A pre-arranged trade involving at least 5 lakh shares or ₹10 crore in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Insider Trading** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>: The buying or selling of shares based on non-public, price-sensitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **SAST Disclosure Rules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>: Applicable when someone acquires 5% or more in a listed company, or crosses 25%, post which an open offer must be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

Using these almost real-time transactions not only structurally improves the cloning strategy but also addresses timing-related comments raised in the previous approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Implementation Steps

To implement the revised strategy, the following steps were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>:

1.  **Identification of Investors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>: A list of well-known investors was identified.
2.  **Extraction of Transactions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>: Buy transactions were extracted from April 1, 2021, until March 28, 2025, covering four years of bulk deals, block deals, insider trades, and SAST transactions.
3.  **Filtering Low-Value Transactions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>: Only buy transactions of at least ₹1 crore and upwards were considered, resulting in 93 transactions from 17 investors across 80 different stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. This contributed to building a broad portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

This refined approach, leveraging real-time data, allows for a more dynamic and potentially more effective investment strategy compared to relying on delayed quarter-end disclosures.

### Benefits of the Modified Approach:

*   **Real-time Data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>: Utilizes almost real-time information, improving accuracy and timeliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   **No Shareholding Restrictions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>: There are no restrictions on the stocks referenced, allowing for fresh investments or top-ups, unlike the previous 1% shareholding rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.
*   **Easier Cash Flow Management** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>: Using a fixed holding period simplifies cash flow management, which was erratic in the prior approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
*   **Realistic Expectations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>: Examining rolling returns across periods provides more realistic expectations, rather than inflated figures like 41.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. It's fair to expect an outperformance of about 5% to 7% over the benchmark index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **Wider Applicability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>: The method can be applied not just to individual investors, but also to FII data, mutual funds, and PMS companies to build custom copycat models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.

This strategy offers an improved framework for investment decisions, although it's important to remember that even seasoned investors make mistakes, with studies showing a success rate of barely over 50% for their picks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

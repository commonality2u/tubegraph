The Indian IT services sector holds significant importance for both India and the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. In the last financial year, it generated an export revenue of $181 billion, contributing approximately 8% to India's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The IT sector accounts for 11% of the total market capitalization in Indian stock markets, a notable increase from 30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This article outlines [[key_metrics_for_evaluating_it_companies | key parameters]] for [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | evaluating IT companies]] like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

## Industry Overview and Growth Drivers

Indian IT service companies operate on a global scale, competing with major players such as IBM, Accenture, Capgemini, ATOS, and Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. Over the past two decades, Indian IT companies have gained substantial market share, while most global competitors (with the exception of Accenture) have lost ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Since 2010, the revenue market share of the top five Indian companies has grown from 9% to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.

India offers several unique value propositions:
*   **Agility** High levels of agility in responding to disruptions, particularly in digital services, which now constitute 30-35% of IT export revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.
*   **Talent Hub** Over 6 million software developers, exceeding the population of Singapore or New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>.
*   **Low-Cost Center** Competitive pricing compared to the US or Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>.
*   **Innovation Ecosystem** Over 27,000 active tech startups creating niche solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure** Over 1,250 global capability centers in India and 780 offshore development centers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:15">[02:04:15]</a>.

In FY22, the industry's revenues grew by 15.5%, the highest growth rate in a decade, reaching $227 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>. The bulk of this revenue ($178 billion) came from exports, with approximately 55% from the US and Canada, followed by the UK and the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:44">[02:23:44]</a>. This ties the Indian IT services industry's growth to global economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. Historically, demand for IT services in developed markets grows at 1.3 times the GDP growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:58">[02:47:58]</a>. The Indian IT services industry is projected to grow at 9-10% over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Risks in the IT Outsourcing Sector
The IT outsourcing sector faces several challenges:
*   **Regulatory Risk** Uncertainty surrounding long and short-term visa availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Companies mitigate this by increasing onshore hiring and subcontracting, though it raises costs and lowers operating margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Competition** The possibility of other English-speaking, skilled, low-labor-cost countries replicating India's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, especially with newer technologies like AI, cloud computing, machine learning, and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:45">[04:37:45]</a>. Continuous adaptation to new technologies is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Exchange Risk** As revenues are mostly in dollars, euros, and pounds, currency movements can impact earnings. A depreciating Indian rupee can falsely inflate reported revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. Companies use derivative instruments to lower earnings volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

## [[key_metrics_for_evaluating_it_companies | Key Metrics for Evaluating IT Companies]]

The [[key_metrics_for_evaluating_it_companies | key metrics]] for evaluating IT companies can be categorized into three clusters: business, [[operational_efficiency_in_it_companies | operating efficiency]], and [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:51">[05:40:51]</a>.

### Business Metrics
*   **Company Size:** Clients prefer working with large IT companies that offer multiple solutions due to ease of organization and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Large companies can also acquire smaller firms with specific skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Tier 1 Companies:** TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies, and Tech Mahindra, each with sales exceeding 50,000 crores last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. They have more sedate sales growth but command higher pricing and better operating margins due to service depth and economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
    *   **Tier 2 Companies:** LTI Mindtree, Mphasis, Coforge, Persistent Systems, L&T Technology, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **Contract Types:**
    *   **Time and Material (T&M) Contracts:** Input-based, clients are charged based on employee count and time taken. This is a low-risk, low-profit model for IT companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Fixed Price Model (FPP):** Clients assign a value to the project, and the IT company manages resources to complete the work. This model offers more flexibility and higher profit potential, though it carries more risk if work isn't completed on time or to satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. The share of FPP projects for Tier 1 companies now averages around 65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. FPP contracts, especially with digital automation, allow revenue growth to be less dependent on employee growth, increasing value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Investors should look for companies with a larger share of FPP contracts as they tend to have better operating margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   **Client Acquisition and Retention:** A higher number of active clients is desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Important metrics include new client acquisition (in various revenue bands: $1-10M, $10-50M, $50-100M, and $100M+), total contract value (TCV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. Large companies like Infosys and TCS report their Fortune 500 client count, which enhances revenue stability and global reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. Client retention is crucial, as repeat orders are more cost-effective than acquiring new clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Companies with a high volume of repeat revenues indicate stronger business models and competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue Diversification:**
    *   **Geographical Diversification:** Desirable to have clients across multiple countries to mitigate geopolitical and economic uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. While the US and Europe currently dominate revenues, future growth in Asia and South America is expected to spread this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Business Vertical Diversification:** An assortment of industries ensures resilience during sectoral downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. Tier 1 companies are active in financial services, retail, communication, manufacturing, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. Banking and financial services (BFSI) is a major growth driver, with spending on cloud, analytics, automation, and cybersecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. Tier 2 and specialist IT companies may have more vertical specialization, such as KPIT Technologies focusing almost entirely on automotive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. Greater diversification in both geography and business verticals provides more comfort to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

### [[operational_efficiency_in_it_companies | Operating Efficiency Metrics]]
*   **Employee Location (Onsite/Offshore Mix):** While offshore work (e.g., from India) is efficient for delivery, having employees onsite in foreign locations (e.g., US) improves coordination, increases chances of winning new orders, and secures repeat business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. Infosys has 196 offices outside India across 80 markets, HCL Technologies is in 52 countries, and Tech Mahindra has over 200 international offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. However, more onsite employees increase costs, impacting the bottom line. A balanced onsite/offshore mix is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.
*   **Manpower Costs:** These constitute 50-55% of total operating costs in the labor-intensive IT outsourcing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. Increases in manpower costs due to talent scarcity or attrition can significantly impact profits, turning projected growth into degrowth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. This is the most critical variable for investors to track quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue and Profit Per Employee:** For Tier 1 IT companies, an average employee generates about 7.2 lakhs in annual revenue and is paid approximately 3.5-3.6 lakhs (around 50% of revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. Investors should look for an upward trend in revenue and profitability per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.
*   **Utilization Levels:** This metric defines the percentage of an employee's time spent on productive, billable work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. Employees not working on projects ("the bench") are a necessary evil but should not be too high or too low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>. A utilization rate of around 85% is generally considered good, though it can vary based on factors like graduate inflow, project types, and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. A large number of non-productive employees can significantly dent a company's profit and loss statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.
*   **Attrition Rate:** A higher attrition rate is problematic due to the costs, time, and effort involved in hiring and training new employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. Employee exits can also affect project timelines and delivery quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>. The 2021-22 period saw high attrition levels, often exceeding 15% and even 20%, though this has moderated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>.

### [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | Valuation Metrics]]

While concrete [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metrics]] and [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuations]] for IT services can be less straightforward than for other industries, analysts typically focus on:
*   **Sales Growth:** A top-line indicator of company performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[018:33:00]</a>.
*   **Profit Margins:** Evaluated at both the operating and bottom-line levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.
*   **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):** Should be examined on both a historical and relative (compared to industry) basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. Some companies, like Wipro, may trade at a discount to peers like Infosys due to factors such as free float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>. A careful analysis of the P/E multiple can reveal over or undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.
*   **Growth in EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Higher growth is better, but it should be viewed over multiple years and compared to industry growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** While Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) is often used for manufacturing companies with debt, most IT companies have little to no debt and are significant cash generators, making ROE a more relevant metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. A good rule of thumb is to target an ROE equal to or above the industry average, with 20% being a bare minimum for selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>.

Investors should prioritize understanding the business model, value proposition, and the business and [[operational_efficiency_in_it_companies | operating strengths]] when [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | evaluating IT companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. Indian IT companies are expected to continue capturing market share, driven by digital, cloud, analytics, and AI technologies, leading to double-digit growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.

> Clark Kent likens a [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | Systematic Investment Plan]] (SIP) to himself, noting their uncreative names and an average destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | Systematic Investment Plan]] (SIP) helps investors navigate market volatility by averaging performance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. It is a popular and effective strategy, particularly for investing in equity instruments like mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This article will explore strategies that can be layered over a traditional [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] to potentially improve returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Professional [[algorithm_based_sip_improvements | Algorithm-Based SIP Improvements]]

### [[step_up_sip_strategy | Step-Up SIP]]
A [[step_up_sip_strategy | step-up SIP]] is an accelerating plan where investors gradually increase their [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] amount over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
There are two common methods for stepping up an [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]]:
*   **Absolute Amount Method**
    *   The investor agrees to increase the [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] by a fixed amount annually, e.g., an initial ₹10,000 monthly [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] increases by ₹2,000 each year (₹10,000 in year 1, ₹12,000 in year 2, ₹14,000 in year 3, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Percentage Method**
    *   The investor raises their [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] by a certain percentage each year, e.g., a 10% increase on an initial ₹10,000 monthly [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] (₹10,000 in year 1, ₹11,000 in year 2, ₹12,100 in year 3, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
According to the speaker, a [[step_up_sip_strategy | step-up SIP]] is a recommended strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### [[value_sip_and_market_timing | Value SIPs]] and [[algorithm_based_sip_improvements | Smart SIPs]]
Various enhanced [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] strategies exist, often termed [[value_sip_and_market_timing | Value SIP]], Alpha SIP, [[algorithm_based_sip_improvements | Smart SIP]], Flex SIP, or Booster SIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The core principle of these strategies is to invest more when markets are down and reduce investments when markets are expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This process is supported by an underlying model or [[algorithm_based_sip_improvements | algorithm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The perceived "fatal flaw" of traditional [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIPs]] is that they invest a fixed amount monthly, ignoring additional market information, such as a significant market drop that would prompt an investor to commit more funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Financial institutions and Asset Management Companies (AMCs) have developed solutions by layering models or [[algorithm_based_sip_improvements | algorithms]] over [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIPs]] to decide on buying, selling, or rebalancing, aiming to enhance [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] returns on a risk-adjusted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

*   **ICICI Prudential Booster SIP**
    *   This offering adds two layers to a traditional [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   **Layer 1:** A proprietary Equity Valuation Index (EVI) model indicates when equities are expensive or cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   **Layer 2:** A variable amount setup transfers an amount ranging from 10% to 1,000% of the base [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] amount, depending on the EVI model's signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. For example, if the base [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] is ₹10,000, the fund house could invest up to ₹100,000 (1,000%) if equities are super cheap or as little as ₹1,000 (10%) if super expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
    *   The Booster [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] utilizes a "source fund-target fund" concept: money is first transferred to a short-duration debt source fund and then moved to an equity or hybrid target fund, on which the EVI model operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   When back-tested over 17 years on the Nifty 50, Midcap 150, and Smallcap 250, the Booster [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] showed a 1% to 2% lift in Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

*   **Kotak Mutual Fund Smart SIP**
    *   This [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] operates similarly, with the monthly [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] amount determined by Kotak's BAFF Net Equity Allocation Model, which flags markets as cheap, neutral, or expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
    *   Kotak applies default minimum and maximum values of 50% and 200% of the [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] amount, though investors can [[Customizing SIP plus Lumpsum Strategies | customize]] these to some extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   A key difference from ICICI's offering is that Kotak directly adjusts the actual [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] amount, rather than using a source and target fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

*   **Other Offerings:**
    *   HDFC Mutual Fund offers a Flex SIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
    *   RankMF.com offers a Smart SIP that buys, sells, and can even skip [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] installments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   PHP.com offers an Alpha SIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

This trend of adding features to [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIPs]] is expected to continue, despite the classical premise of [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIPs]] being about *not* [[value_sip_and_market_timing | timing the market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Investing is an evolutionary process, and it's beneficial to remain open to new strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## DIY [[Customizing SIP plus Lumpsum Strategies | Customizing SIP Strategies]]

This section covers two do-it-yourself (DIY) strategies to implement smart [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] principles without relying on third-party algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Strategy 1: Relative Valuation Based SIP
This strategy is based on the relative valuation between different market indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. It involves analyzing monthly closing values of the Nifty Smallcap 250 TR and Nifty 50 TR indices, recomputing numbers based on a 2007 base value to derive a relative score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Various scenarios were set up to see potential return improvements, which proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. A similar process for the Nifty Midcap 150 index yielded less conclusive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Taxation had minimal impact on the positive alpha generated by this relative valuation [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Strategy 2: Market Valuation (P/E Ratio) Based SIP
This DIY strategy revolves around [[value_sip_and_market_timing | market valuation]], specifically using the P/E (Price-to-Earnings) ratio as the primary basis for investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

*   **Base Scenario:** A regular ₹10,000 monthly [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] into the Nifty 50 TR index from January 2007 to December 2022 (16 years) yielded a CAGR of 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This is the benchmark to beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

*   **P/E Ratio Bands:** The strategy defines bands for the Nifty P/E ratio to classify market valuation:
    *   **Normal:** P/E between 18 and 24 (Nifty's long-term average is ~21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Within this band, the standard ₹10,000 [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Actionable:** When P/E goes above 24 or below 18, different buy/sell actions are activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The approach is to add more units when the market is undervalued and redeem units when overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

*   **Scenarios Tested (Monthly Investment of ₹10,000 into Nifty 50 TR, 2007-2022):**
    *   **Scenario 1 (Base Case):** Invest ₹10,000 every month irrespective of P/E ratio. Result: 13% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
    *   **Scenario 2:** Invest ₹10,000 only when the P/E ratio is 22 or lower (pausing [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] when Nifty is expensive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    *   **Scenario 3:** Invest in all P/E bands, but significantly increase investment when P/E falls below 18 (e.g., additional ₹10,000 when P/E is 16-18, even more for lower P/E bands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
    *   **Scenario 4:** Invest ₹10,000 when P/E is 22 or less. If P/E goes above 22, redeem ₹10,000 worth of units (a buy/sell transaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   **Scenario 5:** Employ an accelerated buying and selling structure across different P/E bands (e.g., commit ₹50,000 when P/E is 11, but withdraw ₹40,000 when P/E is 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

All four modified scenarios (2, 3, 4, and 5) successfully outperformed the 13% base case, supporting the argument that adding an "intelligence layer" to an [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] can improve returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. A master Excel worksheet with formulas is available for download in the video's description to experiment with these numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### DIY Implementation Steps (for P/E Ratio Strategy):
1.  Set a monthly Google calendar notification: "Check Nifty P/E ratio and invest/redeem accordingly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
2.  Visit Niftyindices.com, input dates, and find the previous month's closing P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
3.  Open your P/E ratio band table (from the Excel sheet) to determine the required action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
4.  Log into your trading account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
5.  Buy or sell the calculated number of Nifty ETF units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

This process takes approximately 6 minutes per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The potential gain of 1% to 2% in returns over the long run makes this effort worthwhile, effectively turning a regular [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] into a direct plan-like return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Investors are encouraged to try this approach, even with a small amount like ₹1,000 a month, for at least two years to observe real-world results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

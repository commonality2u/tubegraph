[[introduction_to_factor_investing | Factor investing]] is a strategy that involves making small adjustments to a standard index investing approach, which can lead to significant long-term returns, potentially yielding five to ten percent annual increases compared to benchmarks like the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This approach leverages specific characteristics or attributes, known as "factors," that have been shown to influence the performance and returns of individual stocks or entire portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## What is a Factor?
A factor is a specific characteristic or attribute that influences the performance and returns of a stock or portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For example, market capitalization, or the size of a company, is a popular factor that forms the basis for major indices like the Nifty 50, Sensex, Nifty Mid Cap 150, and S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Historically, indices were primarily generated based on the relative size of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

With improvements in computing power, many more factors have emerged, ranging from simpler ones like profitability and sales growth to more unique factors such as sentiment analysis, human capital, cybersecurity, and even social influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Generally, a factor is not an isolated characteristic but often a package of attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Smart Beta Funds
[[FactorBased Investing | Factor-based funds]] are often referred to as "smart beta funds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. These funds offer several advantages:
*   A passive style of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   A transparent, rules-based methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   A broadly diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   A lower expense ratio compared to active funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>

The [[Factor investing and its impact on portfolio returns | factor investing]] market globally stands at an Asset Under Management (AUM) of $1.3 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, suggesting a significant future for smart beta funds as a primary investment vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Four Commonly Used Factors

### Value Factor
The value factor is based on the idea that companies with a low valuation tend to generate higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. A classic way to define a value company is by picking the top 30% of stocks with the highest Book value to market cap ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

In the Indian market, there are two main value factor-based indices:
*   **S&P BSE Value Index**: Uses a combination of Book value, Price-to-Earnings (P/E), and sales to arrive at a value score, applied over the BSE large-mid cap index to create a 30-stock value-based index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Nifty 50 Value 20 Fund**: Ranks and assigns weights to companies based on Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), P/E ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, and dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This methodology seeks companies with a high ROCE, low P/E ratio, low P/B ratio, and high dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

The Nifty 50 Value 20 index has handsomely outperformed the Nifty 50 Total Return Index (TRI) over five years, at a lower level of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Notably, it made massive gains in 2020 and 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Momentum Factor
The momentum factor suggests that stocks that have performed well in the past relative to their peers will continue to perform well in the future, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This is a time-bound strategy that requires constant moving in and out of stocks over three, four, or six-month periods to capture upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

In India, momentum-based factor funds include the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 and the Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Over a five-year period, this strategy has performed slightly better than the market cap-weighted Nifty 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. However, the momentum strategy works extremely well when stock markets are rising but shows weakness during bear markets, such as in 2018 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Quality Factor
Unlike momentum and value, there is less consensus on the exact definition of "quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Generally, a quality company is characterized by high profitability, a strong balance sheet, and little to no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The S&P BSE Quality Index uses three distinct metrics to calculate a quality score:
*   **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Higher ROE indicates better quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Balance Sheet Accruals Ratio**: Based on net operating assets, a low number is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Financial Leverage Ratio**: Calculated by dividing book value by total debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

The Nifty offers various quality index options, including variations for the midcap 150, Nifty 100, and Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The Nifty 200 Quality 30 index has shown wide variations in returns compared to the Nifty 50, with notable performance differences in years like 2011, 2013-2015, 2019, 2020, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Low Volatility Factor
The low volatility factor challenges the common belief that higher risk leads to greater returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Several studies show that a low-risk portfolio can outperform a high-risk one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This approach gained popularity after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, as investors preferred defensive, less volatile stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Volatility is typically measured as the standard deviation of a stock's daily price returns over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. While the low volatility index has kept volatility lower than the Nifty 50, its returns have been remarkably close on an year-on-year basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This means investors can potentially achieve Nifty 50-like returns with less volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Factor Rotation and Performance Analysis
The performance position of a factor changes in line with economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Historically, momentum and value factors have often dominated performance charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>:
*   **Momentum** performs exceptionally well during bull runs (e.g., 2014-2017, 2019, 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Value** takes charge during market slippages and corrections (e.g., 2018, 2020, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Predicting market movements is challenging, but indicators like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio can help gauge if markets are expensive, cheap, or neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Compared to these four factor indices, the Nifty 50 TRI has often been a poor performer, typically ranking fourth or fifth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The difference between the top-performing factor and the Nifty 50 can be substantial, showing significant "Alpha" (e.g., 14-29% higher returns in various years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Investing in Factors
There are three main [[ways_to_invest_in_factorbased_strategies | ways to invest in factor-based strategies]]:
1.  **Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)**: As of a recent review, there were 18 factor-based mutual fund schemes and 22 ETFs in India, a number that is steadily increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
2.  **Investment Platforms**: Platforms like Smallcase offer numerous factor-based strategies, including momentum, quality, value, and multi-factor approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
3.  **Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Strategy**: For those with time and inclination, understanding the index creation methodologies used by Nifty indices and S&P Global can be a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This requires practice and automation, but can be a rewarding activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

It's important to remember that factors rotate over time, and no single factor is a guaranteed way to create wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Considering lump sum investments rather than just Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) can be explored to exploit the right factor at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[FactorBased Investing | Factor-based investing]] is about defining and applying a set of rules to investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. By choosing the right factor at the right time, investors can potentially achieve up to 10% higher returns compared to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Smart beta strategies and factor investing are considered the future of index investing and warrant allocation in investment portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

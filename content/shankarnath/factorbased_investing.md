[[introduction_to_factor_investing | Factor-based investing]], also known as smart beta, represents a significant shift in investment trends, moving away from traditional market-cap-based approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This method involves passively managed strategies that select investments based on specific characteristics or "factors" to potentially achieve better returns, improve diversification, and reduce portfolio risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

In India, the smart beta category's Assets Under Management (AUM) has grown to approximately 22,000 Crores, with new funds frequently being launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## What is Smart Beta?

Smart beta refers to a passively managed investment strategy that combines characteristics like value, size, volatility, momentum, and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. While this discussion focuses on five primary factors, there are over 100 factors available, including standard variables like profitability and sales growth, and even unusual ones like sentiment analysis, cyber security, human capital, and social media influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These factors select stocks based on criteria other than conventional market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Over 40 different strategies can be found on niftyindexes.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, the investable universe for smart beta ETFs in India is limited to about 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Only a few fund houses, such as HDFC, Motilal Oswal, ICICI Prudential (which has the most ETFs), Mirae Asset, and Kotak, participate in the smart beta category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Overview of Common Factors in Investing

The article examines five primary factors: Alpha, Low Volatility, Value, Momentum, and Quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Alpha Factor

Alpha, or Jensen's measure, was developed by American economist Michael Jensen in the late 1960s to evaluate mutual fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In simple terms, alpha calculates the difference in a stock's performance compared to market returns, with a higher alpha value indicating better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

**Indices and Performance:**
*   **Nifty50 ETF:** A portfolio of 50 stocks with high alphas over the past year, passively picked from the top 300 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Nifty 200 Alpha 30 Fund:** Selects 30 stocks from within the Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 ETF:** India's first multi-factor ETF, launched by ICICI Prudential in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It combines alpha and low volatility factors to offer growth and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

On a trailing basis, single-factor alpha indexes have performed exceptionally well, often beating broader indexes like the Nifty 200 and Nifty 500 by 10% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index aims for a balance between performance, volatility, and downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Historically, Jensen's alpha performs exceptionally well in certain years (e.g., 2007, 2015, 2017, 2021, 2023, and H1 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. However, it can also have very bad years (e.g., 2008, 2016, 2018, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. There often appears to be a pattern of mean reversion, where a good year is followed by a disappointing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Tactically, one might consider investing in the Alpha 50 after a bad year and exiting after a prosperous one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. As of H1 2024, a purely alpha-based index might not be ideal for lump-sum investments due to its significant run-up since early 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. For long-term investors, a 20%+ compounding rate justifies regular SIPs in an alpha factor index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

The Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index is a good option for those seeking above-average performance with less volatility and stronger downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Over 17.5 years, this multi-factor index delivered performance comparable to Alpha 50 while taking lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Low Volatility Factor

The low volatility factor challenges the common belief that higher risk always leads to greater returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Studies show that low-risk portfolios can potentially outperform high-risk ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This premise gained popularity after the 2008 global financial crisis, as investors favored defensive, less volatile stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

**Indices and Performance:**
*   **Nifty 100 Low Volatility 30:** This ETF performed significantly better than the Nifty 100 on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Low volatility indices generally perform well in bear markets, as seen during the 2008-2011 period when safety and valuations were prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

For predominantly large-cap investors, opting for a low volatility large-cap index offers better performance and lower risk compared to the Nifty 50 or Nifty 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The low volatility factor is currently the largest category among [[strategy_indices_and_factorbased_investing | strategy-based ETFs and index funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Value Factor

The value factor is based on the idea that companies with lower valuations tend to generate high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Since "value" is not a direct accounting metric, this factor uses variables like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, Price-to-Sales, dividend yield, and buyback history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

**Indices and Performance:**
*   **S&P BSE Value Index:** Uses a combination of book value, price, earnings, and sales to determine a value score, applied over the BSE large-midcap index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Nifty50 Value 20 Index:** Assigns weights and ranks companies based on Return on Capital Employed, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. It is an antithesis to growth-oriented factors like alpha and momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

The Nifty50 Value 20 index has generally outperformed its market-cap-based counterpart in most years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. While yearly differences haven't always been sharp, small increments add up over time, resulting in a CAGR of 14.7% for the value index compared to 11.8% for the market cap index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

The period from 2008 onwards, characterized by high liquidity, low interest rates, and the rise of tech companies, has generally favored growth stocks and indices over value counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. However, market cycles do turn, often for periods of 7-8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Value tends to outperform when the market is recovering from a bear phase, as observed after the 2008 financial crisis (2009), after 2016 (2017), and after the bear phases in 2021 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### Momentum Factor

The momentum factor suggests that stocks that have performed well relative to their peers in the past will continue to perform well in the future, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. In essence, "winners keep on winning, and losers keep on losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

**Indices and Performance:**
*   **Nifty 200 Momentum 30:** A prominent option within the Indian ETF universe, along with mid-cap, small-cap, and multi-factor variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   Momentum indices have outperformed their market-cap-weighted counterparts in both the short and long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

The momentum strategy performs exceptionally well when stock markets are rising rapidly (e.g., 2007, 2009, 2014, 2017, 2021, 2023, and H1 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Conversely, it shows weakness during bear markets (e.g., 2008, 2011, 2018, and 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

A tactical observation is that momentum tends to perform poorly when 10-year government of India bond yields are rising, but performs better when yields are coming down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Momentum can also be applied over the long term through SIPs and tactical lump-sum investments using ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### Quality Factor

Unlike other factors, there is less consensus on a precise definition of "quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Generally, a quality company is characterized by high profitability, a strong balance sheet, and little to no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

**Indices and Performance:**
*   Good number of ETF options are available for quality, including variants around the Midcap 150, Nifty 100, and Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   On a trailing basis, the Nifty 200 Quality 30 has performed neck-to-neck with the Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   However, the Midcap 150 Quality 50 index has surprisingly underperformed its market-cap-based counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Yearly performance differences between quality and market-cap indices have been minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The expert opinion that quality offers good downside protection and outperforms in a bear market does not show strong evidence based on the examined data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Strategy Indices and Factor-Based Investing: Overall Performance and Allocation

Smart beta indices have generally proven to deliver better returns compared to market-cap-based indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

### Risk Profile and Factor Suitability

*   **Conservative Risk Profile:** For stable capital growth in equities, the low volatility factor is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. It offers better than market-cap returns with a significantly lower standard deviation (risk) than other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
    *   The Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index is also a strong choice, combining low volatility with slightly better performance than pure low volatility indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Downside Protection:** Low volatility offers the best downside protection, followed by the quality factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

### Factor Ranking and Allocation Strategy

When comparing various factors against the Nifty 50 index:
*   The Nifty 50 has only achieved first place once in the last 18 years (in 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. It has spent almost 70% of the years in the lower half of the ranking table (rank 4, 5, or 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
*   The **Alpha factor** and **Momentum factor** have spent only about a third of their time below average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.
*   **Momentum** has never been ranked last in the previous 19 years, showing remarkable consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   The **Quality factor** is less consistent, spending two-thirds of its time in the lower half of rankings with performance similar to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Low Volatility** is a middle-ground factor, surprisingly seeing more top rankings than momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Given its suitability for stability, it's advisable to include it in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

**Personal Allocation Preferences:**
*   **Momentum:** Due to its consistency, a permanent allocation is favored over purely tactical plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Alpha and Value:** These factors show extremes, ranking at the top in some years but having bad times in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This suggests they are better suited for tactical plays, identifying opportune moments for entry and exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

Understanding and reacting to market timing and prevailing conditions are crucial aspects of investment strategy, as exemplified by the approach of Dolly and Rajiv Kana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Active Portfolio Management and Exiting Positions

The Kana's investment strategy is characterized by an active approach to managing their portfolio, including knowing [[when_to_buy_and_sell_stocks | when to exit a stock]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This includes:
*   Selling IT holdings prior to the dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   Exiting Unitech before the global financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   Exiting stocks with high allocations if the company's performance dipped or did not meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

While mistakes can happen, such as exiting positions during COVID-19 due to concerns about lockdowns, and then not quickly re-entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, the overall approach emphasizes responsiveness to changing circumstances.

## Adapting Strategies Based on Market Signals

Rajiv Kana's [[revising_investment_strategy_based_on_changing_market_conditions | investment strategy]] has evolved, moving beyond a sole reliance on fundamental analysis to incorporate market signals and price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### The 30-Day Moving Average Filter
A key element of their current strategy involves monitoring the 30-day moving average (DMA) for each of the hundreds of stocks in their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   If a stock is trading above its 30-day moving average, it indicates a positive breakout, which prompts an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Conversely, if the stock price is below its 30-day DMA, it is considered for selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

This simple filter allows them to exit the market before a significant downturn and enter when a breakout has just begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This approach is distinct from pure fundamental analysis and highlights the importance of technical indicators for [[understanding_market_timing_and_longterm_investment | market timing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Incorporating Special Situations
Another adjustment to their approach includes favoring "special situation investing," which, though rare, can yield significant returns in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Reconsidering "Buy and Hold"
While not against buy and hold [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing]], Mr. Kana views it as just one of many available techniques, suggesting a more dynamic and responsive investment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Impact of Broader Market Conditions
An experiment replicating a portion of Dolly Kana's portfolio showed a placid 6.4% XIRR from June 2021 to June 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This performance was attributed, in part, to the small-cap index being relatively flat for much of that period, demonstrating how [[volatility_in_stock_markets_and_its_impact_on_investment_decisions | broader market conditions]] can influence portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Key Learnings
The Kana's continually improve their [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing approach]] by adding filters like the daily moving average and incorporating special situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This blend of analysis, continuous improvement, and patience, alongside a focus on growth opportunities in small and mid-cap sectors, underscores the significance of adapting to and understanding market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

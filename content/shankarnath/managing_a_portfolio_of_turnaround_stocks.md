Turnaround stocks represent businesses that have underperformed for a prolonged period but are now showing significant and visible signs of improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. These improvements can be observed in stock price performance, like with the State Bank of India, or in business parameters, as seen with Apple after Steve Jobs' return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Turnarounds can also apply to entire sectors, such as the chemical sector in India, which saw a surge due to growing demand, a drop in prices, and capacity expansion after two decades of stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>.

Investing in turnarounds is considered an ultimate contrarian play, requiring investors to bet on a company, sector, or country when most others lack belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. While this approach carries an above-average risk, it can yield far superior rewards with a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.

## Essential Steps for [[turnaround_investing_strategies | Turnaround Investing Strategies]]

Research suggests five essential steps an investor should employ when [[identifying_turnaround_stocks | identifying]], buying, and [[methods_for_analyzing_and_managing_stock_portfolios | managing a portfolio]] of turnaround stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### 1. [[identifying_turnaround_stocks | Shortlisting Potential Turnaround Candidates]]

Several methods can be used to shortlist potential turnaround candidates:

*   **Percentage Below All-Time Highs** The most common approach involves identifying stocks trading below a certain percentage from their all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. However, it's crucial to be cautious and avoid using a lifetime high if it occurred many years ago, as it might paint an incorrect picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Restricting the analysis to a shorter period, such as the last three years' all-time high, can provide a more relevant list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Examples include Adani siblings, Vodafone Idea, Indus Towers, and Bandhan Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **Working the Profits** This method involves analyzing companies that, despite often being in losses, show improvement in profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. A like-for-like comparison across quarters is useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. For example, Jain Irrigation Systems Limited, after significant liquidity issues and debt restructuring, showed improved profitability at operating and net levels, reduced loan interest rates, and increased operating margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **At Least Three Quarters of Increasing Profits** A shortcut for identifying turnarounds is to look for companies that have shown increasing profits for at least three consecutive quarters after years of losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Zomato is cited as a perfect example, moving into positive net profits last quarter after an improving trend in quarterly profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This trend can often be found using screeners that provide at least four quarters of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Credit Rating Improvement** Using credit ratings as a proxy, investors can identify turnarounds by observing companies moving up the rating ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Jain Irrigation, for instance, improved from a 'D' rating to 'Triple B' within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Companies Missing the Valuation Bus** Some companies, despite underlying improvements, fail to reflect their true value in stock price for various reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. The State Bank of India, for example, saw its share price remain stagnant for a decade (2010-2020) despite its profitability doubling, mergers making it bigger and stronger, and non-performing assets (NPAs) being cleaned up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. These visible changes eventually led to a 150% growth in profits and an all-time high share price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

When shortlisting, it's also important to understand what initially went wrong with the company and what actions are being taken to rectify it, such as loan restructuring, change in management, infusion of capital, or sale of non-core assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

### 2. [[financial_analysis_for_turnarounds | Basic Financial Analysis]]

The focus of [[financial_analysis_for_turnarounds | financial analysis]] for turnarounds is not on discounted cash flow (DCF) but rather on two objectives: understanding future earnings potential and, more importantly, determining if the company will survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. A key observation is that 90% of turnarounds take longer and are harder than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

Key metrics to examine include:

*   **Debt Levels** High debt levels are "Enemy Number One" for troubled companies, as they struggle with principal and interest payments while cash flows decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. Panacea Biotech, for instance, turned profitable after selling its Pharma business to repay debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. A comfortable debt servicing position, reducing debt, or zero debt significantly improves a company's chances of a turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Cash Position** This is a crucial number to track, as companies get into trouble due to cash shortages and recover with sufficient cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Troubled companies often sell non-core assets to reduce debt and build cash reserves, which is a positive sign of management's efforts to rectify the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.
*   **Reduction in SGA Expenses** A visible sign of a company gearing up for a turnaround is a steep reduction in Selling, General, and Administrative (SGA) expenses, which are fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. Thermax, for example, reduced employee costs from 16% to less than 7.5% of turnover during its restructuring, improving margins and fostering a performance culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.
*   **Future Sales, Profits, and Margins Prediction** Investors should make predictions about future sales, profits, and profit margins, not necessarily with 100% accuracy, but to understand the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This involves looking at past data, comparing performance with competitors, and reading public correspondence like annual reports and earnings call transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Engaging with the company's investor relations department for revenue, volume, and margin projections over three to five years is also recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. This requires fundamental analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

### 3. [[management_analysis_for_stock_investment | Management Team Analysis]]

A cardinal rule of turnaround investing is to avoid investing in a troubled company until the management team has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. The existing management rarely fixes problems created under their watch, unless they own significant shares or have a proven track record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. Investors should ideally wait for a new management to step in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

*   **New Management** The ideal new management has experience in turning around companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. CG Power and Industrial Solutions, under the new Murugappa group management, completed a financial turnaround by clearing over 2,000 crores in debt and generating profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   **Tracking Progress** It typically takes at least one year, or even 18 months, for new managers to positively impact an ailing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Investors should track their progress quarterly, including executive compensation packages, which should primarily be linked to the company's business and share price performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.
*   **Management Shareholding** A positive indicator is when the management itself buys shares in the company with their own money, signaling alignment between management and shareholder interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

### 4. [[technical_analysis_in_turnaround_stocks | Technical Analysis]]

Performing basic [[technical_analysis_in_turnaround_stocks | technical analysis]] helps determine if the share price is forming a base or a bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. While some find charting subjective, it can help determine if a stock is being accumulated, especially by institutional investors, which is very useful for turnarounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. It also helps gauge the psychology and emotions behind a stock's price action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

Successful turnaround stocks often exhibit repeatable and identical patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. Basic charts that show promise include:

*   **Double Bottom** Indicates the support levels of a stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.
*   **Reverse Head and Shoulders** Signals when a downward trend is nearing its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.
*   **Breakout Scenario** Occurs when the price for a stock moves to the right of a trend line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.

The price and trading volumes of a turnaround stock offer important signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. It is crucial to avoid buying turnaround stocks in a downtrend (catching a falling knife) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. Investment should only occur after a bottom has formed and there is a significant break in technical price support levels, backed by positive news about the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

### 5. [[portfolio_management_and_rebalancing_for_trending_value_strategy | Portfolio Approach]]

Like any strategy, it's vital to view turnarounds as a [[portfolio_management_and_rebalancing_for_trending_value_strategy | portfolio of stocks]] because their outcomes are quite unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. Some companies do well, others merely survive, and many go bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. Turnaround investing is akin to venture capital investing, essentially betting on the management team to generate significant returns by smartly redeploying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

Key advice for a portfolio approach:

*   **Diversification** Maintain a large enough universe of companies to choose from and select those with the best potential Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Detachment** Avoid getting attached to an investment due to research hours or positive bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.
*   **Cut Losers** Have the courage to cut your losers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. A stop-loss is very useful in turnaround situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>.
*   **Realistic Expectations** In a portfolio of 12-15 stocks, the bulk of profits are typically expected from only two or three stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.

### Examples of Potential Turnaround Stocks (as compiled from various sources):

*   **Usha Martin:** Recovered after exiting steel manufacturing, which led to financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.
*   **Thomas Cook India:** Recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.
*   **Suzlon:** Has become leaner, with net debt levels significantly dropping from 11,000 crores to around 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.
*   **Star Health:** Turned a profit after two tough COVID-19 years and has attracted foreign institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.
*   **Zuari Agrochemicals:** News of selling stake in Mangalore Chemicals to refocus on core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.
*   **Zomato:** Has turned in a profitable quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.
*   **PSU Banks:** Showing significant improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>.
*   **Bata India:** Talk of a strategic tie-up with Adidas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.

### Key Characteristics to Look For:

To recap, when seeking turnaround companies, look for:
*   Improvement in sales, profits, and profit margins over the last three quarters compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
*   Reduction in debt with a rising interest coverage ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.
*   A decent cash position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
*   Reduction in SGA expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.
*   A new management, preferably with a track record of successful turnarounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.
*   Managers who are also shareholders in the company and ideally buying more shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.
*   Charting patterns indicating a bottom and a breakout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.
*   Implementation as a [[portfolio_management_and_rebalancing_for_trending_value_strategy | turnaround portfolio]] using systematic strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.

While finding a company with all these qualities might be nearly impossible, a clear understanding of these principles combined with systematic research and analysis can help identify a set of turnaround companies with the potential to deliver superior stock market returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.

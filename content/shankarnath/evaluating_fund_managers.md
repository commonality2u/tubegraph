When selecting a mutual fund, a crucial aspect to consider is the fund manager, as picking a fund is primarily about picking the individual managing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>.

## Understanding Fund Manager Philosophy

To gain insight into a fund manager's approach, it is advisable to read and listen to interviews they have given in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12">[05:12]</a>. This can reveal their core investing style and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16">[05:16]</a>.

*   **Value Investing**: For instance, Prashant Jain, formerly CIO of HDFC Mutual Fund, is known for his strong belief in value investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19">[05:19]</a>. His interviews often feature terms like "margin of safety," "risk and reward," "herd behavior," and "intrinsic value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>.
*   **Growth Investing**: Conversely, Jinesh Gopani, who heads equities for Axis Mutual Funds, leans towards a growth style of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37">[05:37]</a>. His discussions are typically filled with phrases such as "earnings growth," "long-term story," "growth runway," and "P multiplier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44">[05:44]</a>.

While tools like Value Research Online's three-by-three matrix can offer clues regarding investing styles, they should not be treated as mere statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57">[05:57]</a>. Instead, it's recommended to internalize these investing styles as part of one's own identity to truly enhance mutual fund selection skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09">[06:09]</a>.

Investing styles, much like sectors and companies, operate in cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38">[06:38]</a>. For example, 2018-2020 was challenging for value investing, but 2021-2022 was rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40">[06:40]</a>. The opposite trend was observed for growth strategies during these periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51">[06:51]</a>. However, experienced fund managers typically maintain their identified style rather than adopting a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01">[07:01]</a>. This consistency provides comfort to investors, as they know what to expect and can [[reviewing_and_managing_investment_portfolios_for_optimal_returns | shape their portfolio accordingly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07">[07:07]</a>.

## Key Considerations Beyond Historical Performance

When [[improving_stock_and_mutual_fund_selection | selecting mutual funds]], the speaker no longer focuses heavily on historical details like one-year, three-year, five-year, or ten-year trailing and rolling returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36">[07:36]</a>. Instead, a greater emphasis is placed on consistency over the benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53">[07:53]</a>. It is acceptable if a scheme's performance falls below the benchmark in one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57">[07:57]</a>.

A "2-2-1" approach is used for Equity Fund selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02">[08:02]</a>:
*   In the last five years, the scheme was well above the benchmark in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09">[08:09]</a>.
*   It was somewhat around the benchmark for another two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14">[08:14]</a>.
*   It may have been below the benchmark in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16">[08:16]</a>.

This [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | approach]] promotes consistency as a primary factor, preventing reliance on recent performance data for evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31">[08:31]</a>. It also helps improve long-term performance odds by selecting funds with a decent track record that is above average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40">[08:40]</a>.

### Sector Concentration
When evaluating potential equity schemes, it's important to understand how many sectors a fund is betting on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58">[08:58]</a>. While conviction-driven funds betting on five or six sectors are acceptable, funds that are overly concentrated in just one sector or excessively diversified across 15 different sectors should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07">[09:07]</a>.

### Expense Ratio
While not a stickler for the absolute lowest expense ratio, a reasonable figure, ideally less than one percent, is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25">[09:25]</a>. This allows the fund management team sufficient incentives to perform their job effectively, avoiding potential corners being cut in terms of data collection, analyst recruitment, and stock research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35">[09:35]</a>. This is part of the [[importance_of_assessing_fund_of_funds_and_their_expenses | importance of assessing fund of funds and their expenses]].

## Application of the Framework
Currently, the speaker's portfolio, despite containing 28 different equity schemes due to past mistakes, follows an [[approach_to_mutual_fund_selection | investment strategy]] that aligns with their asset allocation preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20">[10:20]</a>.

For large caps, which constitute 30% of the total portfolio, there is no [[reevaluating_actively_managed_large_cap_funds | actively managed large cap fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43">[10:43]</a>. Instead, investments include a factor-based fund, a flexi cap fund, a [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | multi-cap fund]] (noted as a favorite category), and an ELSS fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46">[10:46]</a>. Mid caps include one factor-based scheme and an actively managed mid cap fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56">[10:56]</a>. Small cap investments are through an actively managed small cap fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03">[11:03]</a>, and international funds consist of one actively managed and one index-based international fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08">[11:08]</a>.

The goal is to establish a robust framework that can be customized to individual circumstances, rather than simply providing a list of specific funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22">[12:22]</a>. Data suggests that the longer one remains invested in a fund, the less significant the initial selection criteria become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40">[11:40]</a>. For example, a table of flexi cap funds showed that, excluding an outlier, nine schemes' 10-year SIP performance was within a 1.5-2% range of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49">[11:49]</a>. This data reinforces the focus on how a scheme fits into overall asset allocation, the fund manager's investing style, performance consistency, and avoiding problematic funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06">[12:06]</a>.

Porinju Veliyath is known as the "small cap Czar" and has navigated the stock market through many ups and downs over three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His story encompasses successes, failures, mistakes, portfolio insights, and investment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Early Life and Career Beginnings

Porinju Veliyath was born in 1962 in Chalakudy, Thrissur District, to a lower middle-class family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Due to financial constraints, he began working at the age of 16 while continuing his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. He graduated from Government Law College in Ernakulam and started working at a telephone exchange, earning 2,500 rupees per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

In 1990, after graduating and facing limited employment opportunities, Veliyath moved to Mumbai, the "City of Dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Entry into the Financial Sector

In Mumbai, Porinju Veliyath secured a position as a floor trader at Kotak Securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Due to the difficulty people had remembering his name, he used "Francis Word," the English equivalent of Porinju <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. After four years at Kotak, he transitioned to Parag Parikh Securities, working as a research analyst and fund manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. At the turn of the millennium, he returned to Kochi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Founding Equity Intelligence

In 2002, in Kochi, Porinju Veliyath established Equity Intelligence, a portfolio management firm, marking the beginning of his professional investing journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: The Four Pillars

Porinju Veliyath's investing approach is built upon four strong pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>:

1.  **Value Investing**: He focuses on finding companies with a high margin of safety, primarily in small and micro-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. He believes growth is essential for smaller companies, making it easier to identify deep value in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Multi-bagger picks include Hindware Homes, Tata LXE, CDSL, Raymond, West Coast, and GTPL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
2.  **Contrarian Investing**: Veliyath favors companies with potential that are currently out of favor in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. His philosophy often deviates from conventional strategies, not always relying on financial ratios or business cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Many stocks in his portfolio are illiquid, and he does not adhere to market cap limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. He has stated that ethics and corporate governance should not hinder investments if a company is performing well with good future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
3.  **Investing in Lesser-Known Companies**: A significant portion of his success comes from investing in less popular, but high-quality businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Examples include Gokaldas Exports and Nykka Paper Mills, which he invested in before they gained widespread recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. He believes that investing in "great companies with clean balance sheets, honest management, and clear business visibility" might yield returns comparable to bank Fixed Deposits (FDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. For him, the opportunities lie in small, micro-cap, less popular but growing, high-quality companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
4.  **Diversified Portfolio**: Veliyath strongly advocates for diversification to reduce risk without significantly impacting portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He allocates some capital to large-cap blue-chip companies, though a smaller proportion, and does not have a strong preference for any particular sector or stock type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Porinju's approach suggests that there is no single formula for investing success, and individuals should find a strategy that works best for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. His success from humble beginnings demonstrates that one's background is not a barrier to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Portfolio Characteristics

An analysis of his current portfolio, where he holds 1% or more shareholding in 16 companies, reveals distinct characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>:

*   All 16 companies are micro-caps with a market cap of 2,000 crores or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   Revenue growth shows volatility, which is typical for micro-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   Many of the 16 stocks have underperformed the small-cap index over the preceding three months, suggesting a preference for out-of-favor stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   None of these companies are considered mainstream; most deliver less than 1,000 crores in annual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   The portfolio is diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   From a Return on Capital (ROC) perspective, the businesses are not necessarily "high quality," indicating that Porinju does not select companies based on conventional investing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. He is described as a "classical value-oriented stock picker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Specific Investment Examples

*   **RPSG Ventures Limited**: Porinju holds approximately 32 crores in this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. As an operating holding company with interests in IT, FMCG, health and wellness, real estate, and sports (including ownership of the IPL team Lucknow Super Giants and Mohun Bagan), standard metrics like P/E ratio or sales growth might not accurately reflect its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Singer India**: Despite a high P/E ratio (330), negative sales growth, 4% ROC, and four consecutive quarters of negative operating profits, Porinju acquired a 1% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This was likely due to a recent change in management, with the new MD, Mr. Rajesh Kanna, bringing extensive experience in the consumer and white goods industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This exemplifies a turnaround strategy, where a new management typically takes 12 to 18 months to show positive signs, with significant upside if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **PG Foils**: Porinju recently acquired a 1% stake in this aluminium foil and packaging company, which is generally not discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The company has faced problems, including declining sales and operating losses in the preceding four quarters due to lower aluminum demand and rupee depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The share price dropped significantly from 486 rupees in October 2021 to 196 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Despite this, its low market cap (229 crores), minimal non-current liabilities (8 crores), and substantial cash and investments (over 149 crores) result in a low Enterprise Value (EV) of just 88 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Assuming a steady-state EBITDA of 30 crores, the EV/EBITDA ratio could be as low as 2.9, representing a potential value play in line with Benjamin Graham's principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

Porinju's stock picks are complex and cannot be easily identified using standard screeners, implying multiple distinct variables are at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## Performance and Challenges

Equity Intelligence, being a small and micro-cap focused fund, has experienced periods of both strong performance and difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The most challenging period was 2018-2019, when most mid and small-cap stock prices reverted from high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

In 2017, Porinju Veliyath was widely recognized as the "small cap Czar" due to his PMS fund's impressive performance, with five consecutive years of over 18% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. However, the subsequent two years saw a normalization of these gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. An investor who put money into his fund at the end of FY 2018 would have only just recovered their capital, without making significant profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Mistakes and Learnings

Porinju Veliyath acknowledges that he "got carried away" in 2018 and "paid a heavy price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. He admitted to having "highly concentrated bets in not so proven companies," which led to the downturn in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

One notable stock-specific mistake was with Leel Electricals in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Porinju aggressively bought into the stock, eventually holding a significant 8% of its equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. The company sold its consumer durable business for 1,600 crores, but its promoters allegedly diverted the funds to their personal companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Veliyath documented his concerns in a letter to clients and escalated the issue to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which ordered a forensic audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The promoters counter-attacked, accusing Porinju of trying to arm-twist them and intentionally deflating the stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Porinju reportedly lost about 70% in this transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

These experiences, particularly with Leel Electricals and the market correction in 2017-2019, have refined Porinju Veliyath's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

### Refined Approach and Key Learnings

His learnings have led to several changes in his investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>:

*   He now avoids very small and illiquid companies in his PMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   His portfolio includes larger businesses like Tata Communications, Raymond, and Hindware, which constitute 50% of his holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   He places a greater emphasis on expansion, advising investors to visualize a company's growth trajectory over 5 to 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   He recommends continuous risk analysis, monitoring valuations, market sentiments, and future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   He is now more vigilant about promoter behavior towards minority shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   He advises against buying a stock solely because a large investor has made a bulk deal, as retail investors do not know the original purchase price or prior holdings of the big investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   He warns everyday investors that "casual investing will not work indefinitely" and encourages systematically upgrading and updating one's knowledge and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

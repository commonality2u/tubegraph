Gold has long been considered a valuable asset, and in recent times, its significance in investment portfolios has grown. Over the past year, gold delivered returns of approximately 30%, surpassing the Nifty50's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This article explores the role of Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) as an effective tool for [[benefits_of_asset_allocation_in_diversifying_investments | diversifying investments]] and enhancing portfolio stability.

Historically, the government of India raised over 70,000 crores through Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, SGBs have become an expensive borrowing tool for the government, leading to a lack of recent issuances and even premature redemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The government's reduction of gold import duty from 15% to 6% has made alternatives like physical gold, digital gold, [[comparison_of_physical_gold_digital_gold_gold_etfs_and_gold_mutual_funds | Gold ETFs]], and gold mutual funds more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Why Invest in Gold?

Investing in gold is a strategic decision for several reasons, primarily centered around its role as a portfolio diversifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:

*   **Portfolio Diversification**: Gold exhibits a low correlation with other asset classes like equities, helping to reduce overall portfolio volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Hedge Against Uncertainty**: It acts as a hedge during uncertain times, preserving wealth during market corrections, conflicts, and periods of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The price of gold often moves inversely to inflation, interest rates, and currency depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Scarcity**: As a rare commodity with limited unmined reserves (estimated 52,000 tons), gold inherently holds significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Performance**: Globally, gold has delivered returns of around 9% over the past 40-45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In the Indian context, historical data suggests returns of 7.5-8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

In essence, gold offers safety, diversification benefits, demand often exceeding supply, and good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | Advantages of Gold ETFs]]

Gold ETFs are a popular way to invest in gold due to their specific features and [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_etfs | benefits]]:

*   **Physical Gold Backing**: Gold ETFs primarily invest in physical gold (99.5% purity or higher) and gold-rated instruments, meaning ETF units are directly backed by physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This purity standard is mandated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Price Parity**: Unlike physical gold, which can have varying prices across cities, Gold ETFs offer consistent pricing regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Low Ticket Sizes**: Investors can buy Gold ETFs for as little as 1/100th of a gram of gold, making it highly accessible (e.g., 78 rupees for 1/100th of a gram) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Safety and Storage**: Since ETF units are held in demat form, there are no concerns about theft or storage issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Liquidity and Transparency**: Gold ETFs can be bought and sold during market hours through a trading account without markups or limitations, offering high liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

A comparison across various parameters like form of holding, safety, purity, pricing, liquidity, and minimum investment reveals that Gold ETFs generally offer superiority over physical gold, digital gold, and Sovereign Gold Bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Valuation of Gold ETFs

The valuation of gold within ETFs adheres to SEBI guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The value of gold is determined based on its price on the LBMA (London Bullion Market Association), which serves as the global benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These prices are then converted into Indian Rupees, factoring in transportation costs from London to India, notional customs duties, taxes, and other levies associated with importing gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Asset Management Companies (AMCs) appoint custodians and vaulting agencies for safe storage of the physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

This process incurs expenses, which are covered by the Gold ETF's expense ratio. This ratio includes charges for transport, storage, handling, and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. SEBI has set an upper limit of 1% for the total expense ratio of Gold ETFs, which benefits investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Performance and Portfolio Contribution

While the performance difference between existing Gold ETFs is minimal (around 0.1%), the category as a whole has delivered notable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. In the last year, Gold ETFs returned 28.12%, and on a trailing 5-year basis, they delivered 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

It's crucial to understand that gold investments are not primarily for generating high returns, as instruments like equities or real estate may offer better growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Gold and Gold ETFs excel at providing crucial support during adverse market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. For instance, during periods of market downturns like the dotcom bubble, the global financial crisis, or COVID-19, having gold in a portfolio can significantly cushion the impact and protect against downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Research suggests that allocating a small portion (e.g., 15%) of a portfolio to gold can not only reduce volatility but also potentially lead to higher overall portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This aligns with findings from [[benefits_of_asset_allocation_in_diversifying_investments | asset allocation]] studies, which demonstrate that a mix of equity, debt, and gold with annual rebalancing can yield higher risk-adjusted returns compared to an all-equity portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Therefore, as portfolios expand with equity and debt, allocating 5% to 10% space for gold investments is recommended to enhance risk-adjusted returns and ensure stronger downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This contributes to a truly [[importance_of_diversified_portfolio | diversified portfolio]].

## Grow Gold ETF Example

The Grow Gold ETF, for example, is an open-ended exchange-traded fund designed to replicate the domestic price of physical gold, based on LBMA's daily spot fixing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. It allocates 95-100% of its assets in physical gold and related instruments, with the remainder in debt and money market instruments for liquidity management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. It features no exit load, and its maximum total expense ratio is capped at 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Investors can buy units as small as 0.01g of gold and can even use the ETF as collateral for loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## Current Catalysts for Gold ETFs

Gold ETFs have recently seen a surge in interest, with over 1,300 crores invested in July alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This renewed interest can be attributed to:

*   **Reduced Customs Duty**: The recent reduction in gold import duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   **Favorable Tax Rules**: Budget announcements have brought about changes in tax rules, potentially reducing the holding period and, in some scenarios, offering tax rate relaxations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. (It is advisable to consult a tax advisor for detailed understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.)
*   **Festive Season**: The upcoming festive season often sees an increase in gold demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

In conclusion, for investors seeking to build a robust and [[importance_of_diversified_portfolio | diversified portfolio]] with strong downside protection, allocating a portion to Gold ETFs (recommended 5-10%) can significantly enhance risk-adjusted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

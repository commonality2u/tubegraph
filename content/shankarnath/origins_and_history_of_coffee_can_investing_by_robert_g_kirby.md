[[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | Coffee Can Investing]] is an [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investment strategy]] that was not invented by Saurabh Mukherjee, as is sometimes believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Instead, it was first documented by Robert G. Kirby in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The "Coffee Can" Metaphor

The name and concept of the "coffee can" itself trace back to the Old West, specifically the early 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. During this period, people would store their valuables, such as money and jewelry, in a coffee can and keep it under their mattress for safekeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This simple act of putting something away and forgetting about it forms the core analogy for the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | investment strategy]].

## Robert G. Kirby's Accidental Discovery

Many decades after the Old West practice, a young Robert Kirby "accidentally" stumbled upon the investing version of the coffee can concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This discovery occurred when one of his clients passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Upon analyzing the deceased client's investment portfolio, Mr. Kirby identified a significant "mistake" the client had been making for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The client had invested in every stock Mr. Kirby's firm recommended over the years but had consistently ignored all sell recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Essentially, the client had put away the share certificates in a box and completely forgotten about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Over time, this accidental patience transformed into a massive fortune for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Key Lessons from Kirby's Experience

This interaction provided Mr. Kirby with several crucial [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing lessons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>:

*   **The Power of Multibaggers**
    One key lesson was the presence of a "multibagger"â€”a stock that appreciates capital multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. For Kirby's client, a small investment in Xerox performed this "magic," significantly changing their financial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Mathematically, even a single "hundred-bagger" can profoundly impact portfolio returns, even if other stocks do not perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Importance of Stock Selection**
    The success of this [[investment philosophy and strategy | investing program]] relies entirely on the quality of what is placed inside the coffee can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This means selecting stocks that offer the highest probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Kirby's original work also suggested a minimum market capitalization of 100 crores for companies to be considered for this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

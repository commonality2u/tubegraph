The [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]] is an investment approach that involves intentionally investing in stocks that have recently performed poorly [01:43:03]. This concept challenges conventional investment wisdom by seeking value in overlooked and undervalued assets, potentially leading to significant returns [03:09:03].

## Origin and Inspiration

The inspiration for exploring the [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]] came from an analysis presented by Professor Aswath Damodaran in his book "Investment Fables" [02:46:03]. Damodaran's analysis suggested that an investor buying the 35 biggest losers over the previous year and holding them for five years could generate a cumulative excess return of 30% over the broader market [02:52:03].

Initially, there was skepticism about the viability of such a portfolio [01:00:03]. However, personal experiences, such as a "magic formula stocks" portfolio delivering a 75% return despite the speaker not investing in it [00:19:03], and another subscriber, Mr. A.K. Chan, successfully investing in and tracking a "Losers Portfolio" with handsome returns [00:46:03], spurred a deeper examination.

## Defining the Losers Portfolio

A [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]] focuses on stocks that have experienced significant price declines [01:46:03]. While "significant" can be subjective, the study in this video assumes a cutoff of a **50% maximum drop** in stock price within the last year to qualify [02:02:03]. This threshold is used to avoid companies that might have fundamental issues [02:07:03].

For the study, companies with a market capitalization of more than 1,000 crores were considered [02:19:03]. Examples of companies qualifying under this framework include Primo Chemicals, Best Agrolife, 197 Communications (Paytm), and Delta Corp [02:35:03]. Companies like Rajesh Exports and Raj Rayon Industries, which exceeded the 50% drop cutoff, were excluded [02:26:03].

## Conceptual Basis

The potential effectiveness of the [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]] is attributed to two main principles:
1.  **Mean Reversion:** This principle suggests that if a stock's price has fallen significantly, it tends to revert to its long-term average over time, creating an opportunity for gains [03:14:03].
2.  **[[contrarian_investing_strategy | Contrarian Principles]]:** Investing in a losers portfolio means acting against the prevailing market sentiment [03:25:03]. Numerous studies have shown that this [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian approach]] can be profitable [03:29:03].

## Empirical Study in the Indian Stock Market

Given that Professor Damodaran's analysis was based on US data, a comprehensive 10-year study was undertaken on the Indian stock market to understand the strategy's efficacy [03:36:03].

### Methodology
1.  **Data Compilation:** A list of 1,348 companies with a market cap over 1,000 crores was extracted [05:27:03]. This list included companies in existence today that were also present in 2014, introducing a survivorship bias [05:37:03]. This bias means some companies that ceased to exist (due to acquisition, merger, delisting, etc.) were ignored, which could potentially reduce actual returns [05:47:03].
2.  **Price Extraction:** The financial year closing price (March 31st) for each stock from 2014 onwards was collected [06:23:03].
3.  **Portfolio Creation:** For each year, the 35 worst-performing stocks (applying the 50% drop cap) from the previous financial year were identified [06:38:03]. An equal investment (e.g., 10,000 rupees) was assumed for each stock in the 35-stock portfolio [07:02:03].

### [[performance_analysis_of_losers_portfolio | Performance Analysis]]

The study tracked the annual returns of these portfolios against the Nifty 500 benchmark:

| Period (FY) | Losers Portfolio Return | Nifty 500 Return | Observation |
| :---------- | :---------------------- | :---------------- | :---------- |
| 2015-2016   | 55%                     | -6.5%             | Promising start [07:17:03] |
| 2016-2017   | 51%                     | 25.5%             | Continued outperformance [07:35:03] |
| 2017-2018   | 23%                     | 12.9%             | Outperformance [07:49:03] |
| 2018-2019   | -9%                     | 9.7%              | Underperformance, possibly due to mid/small cap drop [07:57:03] |
| 2019-2020   | -54%                    | -27%              | Significant underperformance during COVID-19 impact [08:31:03] |
| 2020-2021   | 231%                    | 77%               | Strong recovery [08:53:03] |
| 2021-2022   | 9%                      | -1.2%             | Outperformance [09:02:03] |
| 2022-2023   | -11.8%                  | 40.5%             | Underperformance, many losers continued to be losers [09:12:03] |

The study suggests that the [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]] tends to perform well in bull markets and poorly in bear markets [08:45:03].

Over a 9-year period, the [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]] "quite ironically has won the performance battle against the broader index" [09:32:03].

### Long-Term Cumulative Performance

If an investor had consistently invested 10,000 rupees in the top 35 loser stocks each year from 2015 to 2023, the total investment would have been 31.5 lakh rupees [13:00:03]. The value of this portfolio as of March 31, 2024, would have been a staggering 223 lakh rupees [13:17:03]. This translates to a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of **38.5%** [13:23:03].

In comparison:
*   Nifty 50: 14.7% CAGR [13:31:03]
*   Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (one of the best-performing actively managed mutual funds): 21.5% CAGR [13:36:03]

This demonstrates the extraordinary potential of the [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]] [13:45:03]. However, the survivorship bias in the data implies that actual returns might be lower [13:55:03].

## Building Your Own Losers Portfolio

For those interested in experimenting with their own [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]], the video provided a list of 35 stocks as of May 1, 2024, to consider [09:54:03].

### Additional Considerations
While the primary criteria involve significant price drops, investors can apply additional variables for selection:
*   Sales growth [10:07:03]
*   EPS growth [10:08:03]
*   PEG ratio [10:09:03]
*   Promoter shareholding [10:10:03]
*   Interest coverage ratio [10:11:03]
*   Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) [10:13:03]

It is crucial to treat the [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]] as a **system** and strictly adhere to its defined rules [10:24:03].

## Key Observations and Strategy Maintenance

### Impact of Outlier Stocks
The performance of the [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]] can be heavily influenced by a few outlier stocks. For example, in the FY 2015-2016 portfolio, one stock, Dwarikesh Sugar, grew by over 10 times, significantly contributing to the portfolio's overall jump [10:45:03]. Similarly, removing just four stocks (Orchid Pharma, Best Agrolife, Patanjali Foods, and Raj Rayon Industries) from a previous 35-stock loser portfolio saw its 5-year CAGR drop from 91% to 31% [11:34:03]. This highlights the [[importance_of_diversified_portfolio | importance of diversification]] within the chosen "loser" stocks and the discipline to hold them.

### Optimal Holding Period
Analysis of the 9-year data suggests that the **first three years** (Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3) tend to be the most profitable for loser stocks [12:13:03]. Over time, this initial "bump up" in performance tends to dissipate [12:18:03]. Therefore, for those experimenting with the [[managing_a_portfolio_of_turnaround_stocks | Losers Portfolio]], a holding period of **one, two, or a maximum of three years** is recommended [12:36:03].

## Conclusion

The [[portfolio_of_losers_strategy | Losers Portfolio]] presents a compelling, albeit counterintuitive, investment strategy with the potential for substantial returns [14:15:03]. Despite inherent limitations like survivorship bias, the historical [[performance_analysis_of_losers_portfolio | performance analysis]] suggests it is a viable approach, especially when treated as a systematic methodology with strict adherence to defined rules [14:11:03]. It is worthy of consideration as a small experiment for investors [14:19:03].

The beginning of a financial year, particularly the month of April, is an opportune time to [[defining_investment_goals | review one's financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>. This practice is crucial for organizing finances and can significantly contribute to achieving financial goals faster and with less stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

## Why Review Financial Goals?

A thorough review helps individuals track their progress against their objectives and make necessary adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:08">[02:29:08]</a>. Many factors can change over the previous year, necessitating an evaluation of existing goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>.

### Internal Factors
*   **Income Changes:** Your income might have increased or decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:04">[02:41:04]</a>.
*   **New Expenses:** New expenses may have arisen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.
*   **Life Events:** Significant life changes, such as marriage or the arrival of a baby, can introduce new financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:03">[02:49:03]</a>.

### External Factors
*   **Tax Law Changes:** Adjustments in tax slabs can affect your take-home salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. For instance, the union budget often introduces changes in the country's tax laws, like those seen in income tax slabs or presumptive taxation limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Inflation:** Inflation can increase the cost of desired assets, such as a car, making it more expensive due to rising material prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:09">[03:00:09]</a>.

Understanding your goals, your current standing against them, and the changes needed to achieve them is essential for preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>. If you haven't started documenting your financial goals, April is an opportune month to begin this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

Beyond goals, a similar detailed review is recommended for liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a> and for one's [[reviewing_and_managing_investment_portfolios_for_optimal_returns | Investment Portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:02">[04:40:02]</a>. Ensuring your financial calendar includes all key financial events, such as tax filing dates, insurance renewal dates, and investment rebalancing dates, can help maintain discipline and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:02">[12:04:02]</a>.

Ultimately, reviewing financial goals at the start of the financial year is a foundational step in effective personal finance management.

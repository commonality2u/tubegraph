[[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | Unlisted shares]] and pre-IPO shares refer to equity ownership in a company that has not yet been listed on a public stock exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. These shares are actively traded, often seeing significant price movements even before a company's Initial Public Offering (IPO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. For instance, Swiggy's [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] initially sold at ₹350, jumped to ₹400 in early August, and are now trading around ₹470, even though its IPO has not yet occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## What Are Unlisted Shares?

A share represents ownership in a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | Unlisted shares]] simply means these shares have not yet been listed on a stock exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. While not publicly traded, these shares exist and are typically held by company promoters, family members, employees, or strategic partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

For example, in Tata Capital's FY24 annual report, out of over 13,000 shareholders in this [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted company]], 99.58% of the shares were held by just 75 shareholders, with Tata Sons Private Limited holding nearly 93% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | Unlisted shares]] that become available for trading prior to an IPO generally come from a smaller lot of shareholders, such as ex-employees, angel investors, board members, or friends and family of the founder, who collectively might hold a small percentage of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Availability of Unlisted Shares

Many popular companies have their [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] available for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. These include:
*   OYO Rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>
*   National Stock Exchange (NSE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>
*   Lava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>
*   Bira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>
*   Carrier Air Conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>
*   Good Luck Defence and Aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>
*   BOAT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>
*   SBI Mutual Funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>
*   PharmEasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>
*   Chennai Super Kings (CSK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>

The [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] of CSK, for instance, became available when Kotak Mutual Fund, an investor in India Cements, was allotted CSK shares after CSK demerged from India Cements in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Due to CSK remaining unlisted for many years, Kotak Mutual Fund decided to sell part of its holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Trading in the Gray Market

[[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | Unlisted shares]] are frequently bought and sold on the Over-The-Counter (OTC) market, also known as the "gray market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Trading in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] is not illegal in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. The gray market is a network of brokers and dealers who facilitate buying and selling of [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] for themselves or clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

While the gray market is not regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India), which implies a lack of transparency and higher [[investment_risks_in_unlisted_shares | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, [[online_platforms_for_trading_unlisted_shares | online platforms]] like Precise are emerging to offer more price transparency and operational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

## Why Invest in Unlisted Shares?

There are several compelling reasons to [[steps_to_buy_unlisted_shares | invest]] in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]]:

*   **Profit Motive**: Pre-IPO shares are often priced at a discount, offering a potential for significant returns once the company goes public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. The ongoing bull market has seen many [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted companies']] stock prices double in six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Many [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted companies]] are high-growth startups in promising sectors, offering a unique opportunity to diversify an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

## [[risks_and_challenges_of_investing_in_unlisted_shares | Risks and Challenges]]

Investing in pre-IPO shares comes with its own set of [[risks_and_challenges_of_investing_in_sme_ipos | risks and challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>:

*   **Capital Loss**: If an [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted company]] fails to perform or goes bankrupt, the entire invested capital can be at [[investment_risks_in_unlisted_shares | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Issues**: It can sometimes be difficult to buy or sell [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **IPO Delay**: Delays in the IPO process can lead to a drop in the [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted share]]'s value, as seen with OYO, where the share price dropped 50% after its draft prospectus withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Dilution**: As more investors are issued shares (e.g., through ESOPs, rights issues), the value and ownership of existing shareholders can be diluted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **Fraud**: There is a [[investment_risks_in_unlisted_shares | risk]] of scams and manipulations by brokers or promoters, including the sale of fake shares, inflating stock prices, or misrepresenting financials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Transparency**: The gray market generally lacks transparency, though [[online_platforms_for_trading_unlisted_shares | online platforms]] are working to address this through detailed research and clear workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

## Methods to Acquire Unlisted Shares

There are several ways to acquire shares in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted companies]]:

*   Direct [[steps_to_buy_unlisted_shares | investment]] in startups via angel networks, crowdfunding platforms, incubators, or accelerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.
*   Through PMS (Portfolio Management Services) and AIF (Alternative Investment Funds) options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   Purchasing ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) from employees or promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   Acquiring shares from IPO allottees willing to sell them before listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

## [[taxation_on_unlisted_shares | Taxation on Unlisted Shares]]

When selling [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]], [[taxation_on_unlisted_shares | taxation]] depends on the holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. If sold after 24 months, long-term capital gain (LTCG) tax is applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. If sold in less than 24 months, short-term capital gain (STCG) tax is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. STCG is computed based on the investor's slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. A recent budget change has set LTCG on [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] at 12.5%, previously 20% with indexation benefits, which is seen as a significant boost for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

The market for pre-IPO [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] is expected to grow as more private companies move towards public listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

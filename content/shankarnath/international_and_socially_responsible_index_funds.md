When considering [[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | index funds]], the Nifty 50 Index Fund is often the default thought, but a much wider array of options exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. An index is a system that identifies specific stocks, bonds, or other instruments from a larger universe based on a defined methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## International Index Funds

[[international_index_fund_options | International index funds]] are designed to invest in stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) outside of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. They track global indices such as the NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, and the MSCI World Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Recent Trends and Challenges
The meteoric rise of the NASDAQ until 2021 generated significant interest among investors, leading to the introduction of numerous schemes in this category by fund houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. However, 2022 presented challenges for these funds, as their performance dipped due to various internal and external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) halted fresh subscriptions for mutual funds in this category due to an RBI-mandated limit of $7 billion for overseas investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

### Role in Asset Allocation
Despite these challenges, [[international_index_fund_options | international index funds]] play a crucial role in an investor's asset allocation structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. They offer not only potential returns but also a weak correlation with domestic funds, which is beneficial for diversifying a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. For example, the NYSE Frank plus index, comprised entirely of technology stocks, has a correlation of only 0.15 when compared to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. It is advisable to study each [[international_index_fund_options | International Index Fund]] individually, as each scheme possesses distinct characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Socially Responsible Index Funds

Socially responsible index funds have gained increasing popularity, driven by investors' growing concern for how their money is invested, in addition to the financial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

### ESG Principles
These funds operate under the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Their primary aim is to invest in companies that align with ESG principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This includes excluding companies involved in activities such as the sale of firearms, alcohol, tobacco products, gambling, and polluting industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### Global Adoption
While the ESG trend is still developing in India, it has significantly accelerated in more developed markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. A Bloomberg study indicates that sustainable investing managed an estimated $37.8 trillion in assets under management in FY 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This trend is expected to continue growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

Index funds have evolved considerably since the Vanguard Group launched the first publicly traded index fund in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. With numerous options, permutations, and combinations available today, [[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | index funds]] can adequately address a significant portion of a core portfolio, including needs for large, mid, and small cap funds, [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | factor funds]], international funds, bond funds, and even tax-saving funds, with SEBI allowing Asset Management Companies (AMCs) to launch ELSS (Equity Linked Saving Scheme) index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

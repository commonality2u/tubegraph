As a general principle, following the crowd almost always works in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, in investing, common sense suggests doing the exact opposite: buying shares at the lowest price possible to maximize gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This concept is at the heart of [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian investing]]. A [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian]] is defined as someone who opposes popular opinion and does not follow the crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The concept of [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian investing]] was born from the majority's behavioral tendency to often under-react and then over-react to information, which creates exploitable mispricings in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. While the popular version of [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian investing]] suggests buying when others are selling and vice-versa, this is only one aspect and not a universal rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian strategy]] is an excellent way to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns and diversify a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Contrarian Investment Strategies

### 1. Portfolio of Losers
This technique involves intentionally investing in stocks that have performed poorly or experienced significant price declines, typically defined as at least a 40% drop in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The strategy operates on the principle of going against the crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

*   **Underlying Assumptions:**
    *   Stocks with significant price declines may have been oversold due to negative news, market panic, or short-term factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   There is an expectation of a [[mean_reversion_and_contrarian_principles | reversal of trends]], making these stocks attractive again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   An analysis cited in Professor Ashwath Damodaran's book *Investment Fables* suggests that buying the 35 biggest losers over the previous year and holding them for five years generated a cumulative excess return of 30% over the broader market, and an additional 40% compared to a "winners' portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   For the Indian stock market, an analysis of 35 worst-performing stocks from August 2016-2018 yielded a 91% CAGR over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Even after removing outliers (top and bottom four performers), a revised portfolio of 27 losers still delivered a 31% five-year CAGR, significantly outperforming the Nifty's 11.7% growth during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### 2. Conviction Change (Analyst Consensus)
This strategy involves investing in stocks where equity analyst consensus has shifted from a "net sell" to a "net buy" recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. A 2017 report by Motilal Oswal Securities indicated that such a portfolio delivered an annual return of 24.1% over a 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This change in consensus recommendations is considered a robust return predictor, containing information not available in other variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### 3. Investing in Ignored Sectors / Business Cycles
Stock markets often highlight a few sectors while others are temporarily ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. These "up and down cycles" present massive opportunities for [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian]] investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

*   **Example: Pharmaceutical Sector:** The Nifty Pharma index's P/E ratio dropped from 53 to 24 within six months (April-October 2019) due to weakness in US markets, regulatory issues, and pricing pressures, despite the index falling by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This presented an opportunity where the investor community was overstating risk, making investment in the sector less risky and offering higher return potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Between March 2019 and March 2020, while the Pharma index went down 20%, its earnings per share actually increased by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### 4. Early Investments in Underappreciated Growth Companies / Temporary Setbacks
[[contrarian_investing_strategy | Contrarian investing]] involves challenging conventional market sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This includes:
*   Early investments in growth companies when they are under-owned and underappreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   Spotting emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   Investing in great businesses going through a temporary lean patch or hit by negative news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

*   **Example: Eicher Motors:** Between 2004 and 2010, Eicher Motors sold off 13 of its 15 businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. A [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian]] would have seen a more focused company, growing demand for retro-styled motorcycles, and improving operational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Example: Infosys (2016) and Maruti Suzuki (2018):** These companies presented undervalued opportunities when they experienced temporary headwinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. They recovered and regained momentum, leading to substantial returns for the [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian]] investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### 5. High Dividend Yield Stocks
This strategy, exemplified by the "Dogs of the Dow" strategy, involves investing in companies with high dividend yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The thought process is that these stocks might be temporarily undervalued, leading to attractive returns through dividend income and price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

*   **Characteristics:** Typically, this strategy involves investing in utilities or distressed companies with low P/E and price-to-book ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Limitations:** Many of these companies often struggle for revenue growth and some may have delivered negative stock price returns over a five-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### 6. Investing at Maximum Pessimism
This strategy involves looking at pessimism as a friend and euphoria as an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

*   **Example: Peru (1980s):** Sir John Templeton invested significantly in Peru in 1985 during its "lost decade" of economic stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. He logically figured the country was at its point of maximum pessimism, with significant upside potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Over the next 10 years, the Peruvian economy recovered, and the stock market index rose 140 times, compounding to an 83% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Example: COVID-19 Impact on Travel:** During the COVID years, airline and hotel stocks faced significant declines due to travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. As restrictions eased and demand picked up, these sectors rebounded, leading to substantial gains for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### 7. Using Metrics to Identify Undervalued vs. Cheap Companies
Using metrics like Price-to-Earnings (P/E), PEG ratio, Price-to-Book value, and EV/EBITDA is common for stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

*   **Cheap Company:** A cheap company might have favorable metrics (low P/E, high dividend yield, low price-to-book ratio) but could remain cheap indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Undervalued Company:** An undervalued opportunity presents itself as a great business experiencing temporary setbacks or headwinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Investing in temporary setbacks in a great business is a superior strategy to looking at permanently cheap businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

## Contrarian Mutual Funds
While [[contrarian_investing_strategy | Contra]] and [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value funds]] are often grouped, some funds explicitly include "Contra" in their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. On a performance basis, these funds have generally outperformed most index funds and can challenge flexi-cap and multi-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

However, a closer look reveals that most [[contrarian_investing_strategy | Contra]] funds (except perhaps SBI Contra) hold over 70% of their assets in large-cap companies like HDFC Bank, Infosys, Reliance, and ICICI Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Additionally, these schemes often have a large number of constituents (59 or more stocks), raising questions about how different they are from large- or flexi-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Conclusion
To consistently outperform the market, such as the Nifty 50, one must embrace a [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This requires a combination of patience, discipline, conviction, and superior research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

By honing these skills, investors can realize significant benefits from a [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrarian strategy]], including:
*   Higher portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>
*   Reduction in volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>
*   Less overreaction to market developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>
*   Better diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>

## Introduction to Defensive Investing

In investing, particularly in equities, a "defensive portfolio strategy" focuses on providing stability and resistance to economic downturns, much like a strong defense wins titles in football <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. This approach aims for low volatility and above-average stock market returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

## What are Defensive Businesses?

A defensive business produces goods and services that people continue to consume even during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. These are often referred to as [[noncyclical_consumer_sector | non-cyclical stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> because their revenues are less susceptible to economic fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Key categories of defensive goods and services include:
*   **Utilities**: Essential for daily life, such as electricity, water, and gas connections, showing no significant declines in usage during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Services**: Doctor visits, treatments, surgeries, and medicines are prioritized regardless of economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   **Education**: Most families prioritize education despite economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Care Products**: Items like toothpaste, soap, shampoo, and face wash are always in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Household Goods**: Cleaning supplies and kitchen essentials are necessary to maintain a functional living space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Telecommunications**: Mobile plans and internet connections have become crucial for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

Examples of companies in this space include HUL, Asian Paints, Britannia, Airtel, and Avenue Supermarts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### Identifying Non-Cyclical Stocks

Beyond industry classification, another way to identify [[noncyclical_consumer_sector | non-cyclical stocks]] is by looking at a stock's **beta** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Beta** is a measure of a stock's volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   Defensive, [[noncyclical_consumer_sector | non-cyclical stocks]] typically have a **low beta**, meaning they are less volatile than the broader market like the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   A beta of less than one theoretically indicates that including such stocks can reduce the overall risk of a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. For example, if the market falls by 10%, Hindustan Unilever, with a beta of 0.19, would historically fall by only 1.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Characteristics of Non-Cyclical Stocks

In addition to stable demand, resilient earnings, and low beta, [[noncyclical_consumer_sector | non-cyclical stocks]] typically exhibit:
*   A history of strong, consistent, and rising dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   Strong balance sheets with low levels of debt, enabling them to withstand economic downturns more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   Market leadership with established brands and dominant market positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

## Investing in Non-Cyclical Stocks

### Active Investment Approach

One method is a "coffee can style" investing, where an investor selects 15-20 defensive stocks, invests equally in each, and holds them for several years, expecting some to perform exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. A diversified portfolio of such stocks has historically outperformed the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] over 5, 7, and 10-year periods, and in most individual years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Passive Investment Approach: The Nifty NonCyclical Consumer Index (NCCI)

For a passively managed solution, the Nifty NonCyclical Consumer Index (NCCI) tracks the performance of a portfolio of stocks broadly representing the [[noncyclical_consumer_sector | non-cyclical consumer sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

#### Index Construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>
1.  **Identify Basic Industries**: The index focuses on specific consumer-facing sectors like consumer goods, telecom, media services, entertainment, textiles, FMCG, and related industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Select Largest Companies**: The 30 largest companies from these industries are chosen based on their six-month average free-float market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. This list is reviewed semi-annually in January and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
3.  **Assign Weightage**: A weight is assigned to each stock based on its free-float market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
4.  **Risk Management**: The weightage of each stock is capped at a maximum of 10% to manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

#### Performance Analysis of NCCI

The NCCI has historically performed better than both the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] and the Nifty 500 across various time periods, with a total price return of 16.2% since its inception in April 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

*   **Consistency of Returns**: The NCCI shows remarkable consistency, with annual returns generally ranging from 18% to 32% since 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
*   **Resilience During Downturns**: In 2008, when the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] lost half its value, the NCCI actually gained 4.6%, demonstrating its stability, low volatility, and ability to absorb economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.
*   **Low Beta**: The NCCI's beta relative to the Nifty 500 averages around 0.78, indicating low volatility and serving as a strong diversification tool, especially for portfolios heavy in large and mid-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

### Alternating Investment Strategy (NCCI vs. Nifty50)

An interesting pattern observed is that the NCCI and the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] tend to alternate in performance year-on-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. This suggests a potential investment strategy:
*   Invest in the index that underperformed in the previous year, assuming it will do better in the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   For example, if the NCCI outperformed in 2013, one would invest in the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] for 2014, and then switch to the NCCI for 2015 if the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] outperformed in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.

Applying this alternating sequence from January 2007 to 2023, an initial investment of 1 lakh rupees would have grown to 21.7 lakh rupees, achieving a 17-year pre-tax CAGR of 21.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. Even after accounting for a 10% long-term capital gains tax, this method yields an annualized return of 19.9% over 17 years, excluding dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

## Who Should Invest and Risks

### Target Investors
The NCCI is suitable for investors seeking stable and consistent returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>, particularly those with a relatively lower risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

### Available Schemes
Currently, the HDFC Non-Cyclical Consumer Index Fund is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>, with other fund houses like Groww also having filed for similar offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

### Risks
While offering stability, the NCCI is still an equity investment and carries associated risks:
*   **Periods of Underperformance**: There will be times when the consumer theme might not perform as well as other sectors or the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. This has been observed in the last three years since COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation and Timing**: The consumer theme in India generally has high valuations (high P/E ratios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. This makes the timing of lump-sum entry and exit crucial, especially if not planning to hold the investment for a decent period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Nifty NonCyclical Consumer Index provides investors with a relatively stable way to participate in equities, offering low volatility, recession resistance, and historically better returns compared to broad market indices like the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] or Nifty 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. Furthermore, the consumer sector in India benefits from significant tailwinds such as rising GDP per capita, leading to higher expenditure, a young population, urbanization, and a growing organized sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.

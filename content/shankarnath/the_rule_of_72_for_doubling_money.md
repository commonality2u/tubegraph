From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

The Rule of 72 is a thumb rule used to estimate the time it takes for an investment to double in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08"></a>. While not 100% precise, it offers a quick and effective method for financial calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43"></a>.

## How it Works

To calculate the approximate number of years required for an investment to double, you divide 72 by the annual interest rate or rate of return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15"></a>.

*   **Example 1**: If you invest in a fixed deposit offering an annual interest of 6%, your money would double in approximately 12 years (72 divided by 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18"></a>.
*   **Example 2**: An 8% fixed deposit would double your money in about 9 years (72 divided by 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24"></a>.
*   **Example 3**: For an investment with a 12% annual return, it would take roughly 6 years for your money to double (72 divided by 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29"></a>.

## Application in a Rapid Fire Quiz

This rule proved useful in a rapid-fire quiz where a contestant had to determine how long it would take for six lakh rupees to grow to one crore rupees at a 9% interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13"></a>.

1.  **Calculate Growth Multiple**: The target is to grow six lakh to one crore, which is approximately a 16x increase (1 crore / 6 lakh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40"></a>.
2.  **Determine Doubling Time**: Using the Rule of 72, at a 9% interest rate, money doubles in 8 years (72 divided by 9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42"></a>.
3.  **Iterate Doubling**:
    *   1x becomes 2x in 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48"></a>.
    *   2x becomes 4x in 16 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50"></a>.
    *   4x becomes 8x in 24 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52"></a>.
    *   8x becomes 16x in 32 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54"></a>.

The contestant swiftly arrived at the answer of 32 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23"></a>. Although the exact calculation might be 32 years, 7 months, and 28 days, the rule provides a sufficiently close estimate for quick decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05"></a>.

## Reversing the Rule

The Rule of 72 can also be reversed to estimate the percentage of returns needed to double your money within a specific timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12"></a>.

*   **Example**: If you wish to double your money in four years, you would need a financial instrument capable of delivering an 18% return (72 divided by 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26"></a>.

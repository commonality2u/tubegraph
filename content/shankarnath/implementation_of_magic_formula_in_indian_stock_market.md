Heuristics are mental shortcuts that enable quick results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. An example is the rule of 72, which quickly estimates the time it takes for money to double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Applying similar "magic" to investing, [[Magic Formula Investing Strategy by Joel Greenblatt | Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula]] is a framework designed to identify "good companies at favorable prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The term "magic" is primarily a marketing device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, but the strategy has shown strong returns, with Greenblatt's portfolio delivering an annualized return of 23.8% between 1998 and 2009, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 9.6% in the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The exact process is detailed in his book, "The Little Book That Beats the Market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Key Metrics of the Magic Formula

The strategy hinges on two core metrics to define "cheap" and "good" companies:

### Cheapness: Earnings Yield
Earnings Yield indicates how cheaply a company is valued from a valuation perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Calculation**: A company's operating earnings (EBIT - Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) as a percentage of its Enterprise Value (EV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Operating Earnings (EBIT)**: Easily found in a company's profit and loss statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Enterprise Value**: Calculated by considering the company's market capitalization, debt, and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Interpretation**: A higher earnings yield indicates a cheaper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Quality: Return on Capital (ROC)
Return on Capital identifies good companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Calculation**: Operating earnings (EBIT) divided by the summation of its net fixed assets and networking capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Interpretation**: A higher ROC signifies that the company is using its resources more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. It serves as a proxy for business quality, indicating a superior brand, loyal customer base, excellent products/services, a strong sustainable business model, and a wide economic moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

**Example with Asian Paints**:
*   **Earnings Yield**: EBIT / (Market Cap + Debt - Cash) = 1.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
*   **ROC**: EBIT / (Net Fixed Assets + Net Working Capital) = 39.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>

## Nine Steps for [[Magic Formula Investing Strategy by Joel Greenblatt | Magic Formula Investing]]

Joel Greenblatt outlines nine rules for implementing the strategy:

1.  **Market Capitalization Filter**: Apply the formula only to companies with a market cap of at least 100 million dollars (for India, this can be set to 5000 crores or more, limiting the universe to the top 500 companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
2.  **Sector Exclusion**: Exclude financial companies and utilities due to their unique financing structures involving large amounts of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
3.  **Geographic Exclusion**: Ignore foreign companies and American Depositary Receipts; for Indian investors, this means sticking to Indian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
4.  **Calculate Earnings Yield**: Compute the earnings yield for the filtered universe of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
5.  **Calculate Return on Capital**: Compute the ROC for the filtered universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
6.  **Rank Companies**: Allocate a rank to each company based on their earnings yield and ROC. Then, add these two ranks together to get a total score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Companies with a lower total score are better positioned in terms of combined cheapness and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Finally, sort the table based on the total score to get a preferred list of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
7.  **Invest in Top-Ranked Companies**: Invest in about 20 to 30 of the highest-ranking companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Greenblatt suggests accumulating these stocks progressively, investing in four to five companies each quarter over a 12-month period to take advantage of fluctuating valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
8.  **Annual Rebalancing**: Rebalance the portfolio once a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. For tax efficiency, sell loser stocks in the 51st week of purchase to book short-term capital losses, and sell winner stocks in the 53rd week from purchase for long-term capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The proceeds are then used to repeat the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
9.  **Persistence**: Persist with the [[Magic Formula Investing Strategy by Joel Greenblatt | Magic Formula]] approach for at least five years to derive maximum benefit from the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## [[Backtesting and Performance of Magic Formula | Performance in the Indian Stock Market]]

Global studies across various countries have supported the Magic Formula's ability to deliver superior results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce Study (2021)
A 2021 paper by research students from Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce simulated the [[Magic Formula Investing Strategy by Joel Greenblatt | Magic Formula]] on Indian stocks over an eight-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>:
*   On a risk-unadjusted basis, the Magic Formula delivered better returns in 5 out of 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   It achieved a CAGR of 13.9% against the BSE Sensex's 9.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   A 30-stock portfolio offered better returns than 10-stock or 50-stock portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, highlighting the balance between focus and broad diversification.

### Amit Madha's Backtest (2002-2020)
Another article by Amit Madha backtested the [[Magic Formula Investing Strategy by Joel Greenblatt | Magic Formula]] from 2002 to 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. He simulated an equal-weighted portfolio of 25 stocks (4% allocation per stock) over an 18-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   While the Nifty 50 generated a 12.7% return during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, his Magic Formula portfolio would have delivered an astounding 35.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   This implies that 1 lakh rupees invested in 2002 would have grown to 2.33 crores by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

These results build a strong case for considering the [[Magic Formula Investing Strategy by Joel Greenblatt | Magic Formula]] in one's investing approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## How to Invest using Magic Formula in India

### 1. Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Approach
This involves following the nine steps manually.
*   **Considerations**: When identifying top-ranking companies, be cautious of cyclical sectors like metal and mining, which might show high operating income due to recent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. It's advisable to use normalized earnings (average over 5-6 years) or omit such companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Cash-Rich Companies**: Be aware that companies with high cash balances might have lopsided earnings yield numbers because Enterprise Value excludes cash in its calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This can misrepresent the actual return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Beyond the Formula**: It's crucial not to blindly trust a Magic Formula screener. Always back it up with an analysis of the company's business model, financial statements, seasonality, promoter integrity, and growth runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

### 2. Sourcing from Websites
Lists of [[Magic Formula Investing Strategy by Joel Greenblatt | Magic Formula]] stocks are available on Indian financial websites like Value Research Online, Screener.in, and Equitymaster.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Some may offer these lists for free, while others charge a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. It's important to check the historical performance of such lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

Since the dawn of human civilization, approximately 200,000 tons of gold have been mined globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. To put this into perspective, this weight is comparable to a large ship like the one that was stuck in the Suez Canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

The distribution of this mined gold is as follows:
*   Approximately half is used for jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   About 20% is in the form of coins, [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | Gold ETFs]], gold mutual funds, and similar instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   Central banks worldwide hold another 18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   The remainder is utilized in industrial applications such as smartphones, microchips, medicines, and even tooth fillings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

While some gold is consumed, a significant portion is considered "investable gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Benefits of Investing in Gold
[[benefits_of_investing_in_gold | Gold]] is not universally recommended, with notable investors like Warren Buffett expressing their dislike for it (though Buffett did invest in 3,700 tons of [[methods_to_invest_in_silver | silver]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, it offers several compelling [[risks_and_returns_associated_ مربوط به_different_gold_investment_options | benefits]] for investors:
*   **Historical Returns**
    *   Over the past 40 years, gold has delivered a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   With an annual Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), this return increases to 10.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Stability and Low Volatility**
    *   The price of gold has fallen on a year-on-year basis only seven times over the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   The maximum annual decline in gold's price has been 14%, which is significantly better than the BSE Sensex, which has experienced falls of 14% or more on seven different occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   Gold is considerably less volatile compared to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Hedging Tool**
    *   Gold often exhibits an inverse correlation with stock markets, making it an efficient hedging tool for asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   It tends to perform well during periods of stock market depression or financial calamities, such as in 1991-92, 2000, 2008-09, 2020, and 2023 when the economic climate was uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Diversification**
    *   Many experts recommend allocating around 10% of an investment portfolio to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Methods to Invest in Gold
Gold can be acquired in various forms, both physical and electronic:

    *   Includes jewelry, gold coins, gold bars, and bullion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Physical gold can be purchased from banks (coins) or local jewelers (ornaments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   Indian households are estimated to hold 25,000 tons of gold, representing about 12% of all gold ever extracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold**
    *   Purchased electronically through fintech companies and mobile apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)**

*   **Gold Mutual Funds (MFs)**
    *   Funds that typically invest in one or multiple gold ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
    *   Available on aggregator or trading platforms and mutual fund websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)**
    *   Government-backed bonds denominated in grams of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   Issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in new tranches every few months, with buying windows open for five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   Also tradable on Indian stock exchanges, allowing purchase even outside official buying windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Comparison of Gold Investment Options
Investors should consider several attributes when choosing a gold investment product:

### Availability
*   **Physical Gold**: Readily available from banks (coins) and jewelers (ornaments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold**: Widely distributed by fintech companies and accessible via numerous mobile apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs & Gold Mutual Funds**: Can be bought on aggregator or trading platforms and mutual fund websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds**: Available during RBI-released buying windows (typically 5 days every few months) or through trading accounts on Indian stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Overall**: All five options are considered sufficiently accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Risk
[[comparison_of_physical_gold_digital_gold_gold_etfs_and_gold_mutual_funds | Different gold investment options]] carry varying levels of risk:
*   **Physical Gold**: High risk due to chances of theft, tampering with quality, and potential loss during making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold**: Escapes physical risks but suffers from a lack of regulatory oversight; no SEBI, RBI, or other body supervises these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs**: Backed by actual physical gold of 99.5% purity, stored with custodian banks and periodically valued as per SEBI guidelines. This offers strong regulation and real gold backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Gold Mutual Funds**: Inherit the regulatory and backing benefits from the underlying Gold ETFs they invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds**: Not backed by physical gold but are derivative instruments where the Government of India uses gold price to define the bond's value. The RBI promises to pay the maturity amount based on gold price on maturity date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Risk is minimal unless the Indian government defaults, though standard reinvestment and inflation risks apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Minimum Investment
*   **Physical Gold**: Can be bought in small quantities like a 0.5 gram gold coin, costing around 3500 Rupees at current prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold**: Highly fractionalized; can be bought for as little as one rupee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs**: Minimum purchase of one unit, equivalent to 0.01 grams of gold, or about 60 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Gold Mutual Funds**: Low entry amount, as little as 100 Rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds**: Require a minimum purchase quantity of one gram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Overall**: Gold is generally available in smaller quantities, making it accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Costs and Returns
Costs directly impact returns for gold investments:
*   **Physical Gold**:
    *   **Costs**: Three major costs include design and making charges, storage costs, and a 3% GST. These can add 10-20% to the gold's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Additional costs include insurance and bank locker fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   **Returns**: Generally a weak option from a return on investment perspective due to high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold**:
    *   **Costs**: Attracts a 3% GST on purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Also has a significant buy-sell spread (e.g., 5.8% difference between buy and sell price at one point). This spread covers storage, technology, transportation, insurance, and GST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
    *   **Returns**: Expected to deliver around 7.7% over a five-year period due to the buy-sell spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs**:
    *   **Costs**: Come with an expense ratio typically between 0.5% to 0.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Smaller costs like brokerage, demat account charges, STT, and stamp charges also apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   **Returns**: If gold appreciates by 9% annually, [[comparison_of_gold_etfs_physical_gold_and_sovereign_gold_bonds | Gold ETFs]] would yield approximately 8.4% (9% minus ~0.6% expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Gold Mutual Funds**:
    *   **Costs**: Direct plan expense ratios might appear low (e.g., 0.1-0.2%), but the actual expense ratio includes the expense ratio of the underlying Gold ETFs they invest in. For example, an SBI Gold Fund might have a combined expense ratio of 0.74% (0.1% + 0.64% of underlying ETF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   **Returns**: Expected to be slightly below Gold ETFs, around 8.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)**:
    *   **Costs**: Have no visible expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Investors submitting online applications and paying electronically are eligible for a 50 rupee per gram discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   **Returns**: Offer a fixed interest of 2.5% per annum on the initial investment, credited semi-annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. If gold appreciates by 9% annually, SGBs offer an expected return of over 11% (9% + 2.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
    *   **Comparison**: SGBs clearly lead in terms of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Liquidity
Gold is traditionally viewed as a savings instrument in India, making liquidity an important factor:
*   **Physical Gold**: Jewelers typically buy ornaments or coins and pay on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs & Gold Mutual Funds**: Can be liquidated during trading hours, though it may take a couple of days for funds to reach the bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Digital Gold**: Most liquid, with units sellable 24x7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Gold Bonds**:
    *   Have an 8-year maturity period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   **Early Redemption Options**:
        *   **Secondary Market**: Tradable on Indian stock exchanges after six months of issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. However, due to low liquidity, SGBs often sell at a discount in the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Websites like sgpanalyzer.com can help examine discounts and yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
        *   **Premature Encashment with RBI**: Allowed after five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
    *   **Loan Option**: Loans can be availed against SGBs (e.g., State Bank of India offers up to 20 lakhs with an LTV of up to 65% of the bond's market value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### Taxes
[[impact_of_government_policy_and_taxation_on_gold_investments | Taxation]] varies significantly across gold products:
*   **At Time of Buying**:
    *   A 3% GST is charged when buying physical or digital gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **At Time of Selling (Capital Gains Tax)**:
    *   **Physical Gold & Digital Gold**: Capital gains depend on the holding period. If held for less than three years, marginal tax rate applies. If sold after three years, taxed at 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
    *   **Gold ETFs & Gold Mutual Funds**: No concept of holding period for tax purposes. Gains are now taxed as per the applicable slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
    *   **Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)**:
        *   The 2.5% annual interest received is added to one's income and taxed at the prevailing income tax slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
        *   If redeemed at maturity (after 8 years), capital gains are entirely tax-free, regardless of whether the SGB was bought during launch or from the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
        *   Premature RBI-allowed redemption (after 5 years, in the 6th, 7th, or 8th year) is also believed to be tax-free, though it's advised to consult a tax advisor for confirmation due to conflicting information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

India has a deep cultural connection to gold, evidenced by the fact that there are more goldsmiths ("sonar ki dukan") than bank ATMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. When choosing a gold product, investors should evaluate [[comparison_of_physical_gold_digital_gold_gold_etfs_and_gold_mutual_funds | availability, risk, starting investment, returns, costs, liquidity, and taxes]], alongside their investment objective, holding period, and safety considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

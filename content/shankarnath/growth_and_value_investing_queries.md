A stock screener is a tool that helps filter thousands of stocks based on specific financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These variables can include data from financial statements (balance sheet, P&L, cash flow), price-based information (share price, return, market cap, moving averages, RSI), ratios (dividend yield, P/E multiple, book value, asset turnover), and non-standard variables (credit rating, Proski score, analyst recommendations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Popular platforms include screener.in, ticker tape, trend line, and stock edge, with some AI-powered options emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

Instead of broad objectives like "a list of 10 multi-bagger stocks," it is more effective to break down goals into manageable sub-goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

### General Principles for Using Screeners

*   **Simplicity**: Use simple queries rather than complex ones with many variables, as overly long queries can obscure the central factors driving a company's stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Screener, Not Picker**: Remember that a screener is a tool for filtering, not for directly picking stocks for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. Screening is only the first step in the investment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.
*   **Further Research**: Always research the companies that appear in screener results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. This includes examining quantitative factors like order books, new products, and demand/supply, as well as qualitative factors such as management quality, competitive advantages, and sector tailwinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Too Many Variables**: Do not use too many variables in a custom screener, as this often leads to unworkable results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. Instead, select only variables that align perfectly with your chosen strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.
*   **Beware of False Positives**: Be cautious of situations where a stock looks attractive on paper due to sector cyclicity, a value trap, or being at a peak in price, demand, or margins, which could lead to downward mean reversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy Cycles**: Recognize that every strategy or query will experience good and bad periods, and results are likely to change every few months, necessitating rigorous examination of short-listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.

### Situational Queries

Screeners can identify companies undergoing specific situations that could be profitable for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

*   **Rapid Capacity Expansion**:
    *   Companies rapidly expanding capacity may see increased orders and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Query Example**: `Gross block (current year) is at least two times of the preceding year` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Sky Gold, which saw a significant jump in sales and profits after expanding its facility three times in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Turnaround Stories**:
    *   Defined as companies posting two or three consecutive quarters of profits after struggling for several quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Sami Hotels, which delivered four quarters of profits after years of losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency Improvement**:
    *   **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)**: Measures how efficiently a company generates profits from its total capital (debt and equity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Queries can identify companies consistent with their ROCE over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Operating Margins (EBITDA/Sales)**: Visible growth in operating margins is a positive sign, though sectoral cyclicity should be accounted for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Other Variations**:
    *   Price breakouts using moving averages, RSI, and volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
    *   Changes in promoter holdings (indicating insider buying or selling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
    *   Analyst upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### [[Comparison of Growth and Value Investing | Investing Strategies]]

Screeners can be used to build queries for various [[Investment and portfolio growth strategies | investment and portfolio growth strategies]].

#### [[Investment and portfolio growth strategies | Growth Investing Queries]]

[[Investment and portfolio growth strategies | Growth investing]] focuses on companies with high revenue growth, earnings growth, and business expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

*   **[[Growth at Reasonable Price GARP Metrics | GARP (Growth at Reasonable Prices)]]**:
    *   A strategy that combines growth and value by using a mix of revenue growth, EPS, and PEG ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
    *   **Note**: PEG ratio displayed by most screening platforms may not be entirely accurate, often using a 5-year profit growth rate in the denominator instead of the expected EPS growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   **[[Identifying High Growth Potential Companies | Small Cap Hypergrowth Query]]**:

    *   Earnings growth is sometimes excluded due to the inherent volatility of growing companies, emphasizing the need for further reading and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   **Disruptive and Technology-Oriented Innovative Companies**:
    *   Difficult to execute on many Indian screeners, but ideal criteria include: high revenue growth, R&D expenses at least 10% of sales year-on-year, customer growth over 50%, recurring revenue 70% or more, high gross margins, heavy insider ownership (especially institutional investors), and rapidly rising market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

*   **James O'Shaughnessy's Trending Value Strategy**:
    *   Uses a combination of variables like P/E ratio, price-to-book, price-to-sales, and EV/EBITDA to arrive at a combined score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

#### Other Strategies

*   **Earnings Momentum**:
    *   **Query**: Uses a number of profit-related variables with a dash of sales growth and price momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

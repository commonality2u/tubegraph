Grow Mutual Fund is launching a Nifty Small Cap 250 Index Fund AFO, with subscriptions open from February 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Namrita, an educator at Grow Mutual Fund, provides insights into this investment category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Why Small Caps?

Small cap companies are generally perceived as [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_in_small_cap_stocks | high risk stocks]], but they also possess the potential for significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Historically, [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap stocks]] have demonstrated very good earnings growth compared to mid cap and large cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Many stocks that have yielded 10X returns over the last decade are likely to be in the small cap category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. However, investors must acknowledge the inherent [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_in_small_cap_stocks | high risk]] in this category compared to mid caps and large caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Importance of Diversification in Small Caps
Diversification is crucial in the [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap space]] to help reduce [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_in_small_cap_stocks | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap category]] is a [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_in_small_cap_stocks | high risk category]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Choosing the wrong small cap stock can lead to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Over the last five years, [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small caps]] have had the highest percentage of stocks with negative returns compared to mid caps and large caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Therefore, investing in the entire basket of the small cap universe, such as through an index, helps lower the downside [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_in_small_cap_stocks | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## The Nifty Small Cap 250 Index

These 250 stocks are diversified across 22 sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Investing in Small Caps: Options and Benefits of Index Funds

There are three primary ways for an investor to approach [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap investments]]:

1.  **Directly buying small cap stocks**: [[strategies_for_smallcap_and_midcap_stock_selection | Selecting the right stock]] can be challenging as [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap stocks]] tend to be highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
2.  **Investing in an actively managed small cap fund**: There are 24 active small cap funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Each fund has a different investment philosophy, leading to varied returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. There is no guarantee that a top-performing actively managed fund will continue to excel in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. It is advisable to consult a financial advisor when selecting an actively managed fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
3.  **Investing in a [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | small cap index fund]]**: This approach involves investing in the entire universe of small caps, mirroring the index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. A [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | small cap index fund]] holds the same 250 stocks as the index in the exact same weightage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This provides diversification across 21 sectors, which is crucial for managing [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_in_small_cap_stocks | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. It also ensures coverage of high-performing companies within the small cap universe, preventing investors from missing out on individual stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Historical Performance of the Nifty Small Cap 250 Index

When considering [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap investments]], it is important to focus on long-term performance rather than short-term returns, as it is a [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_in_small_cap_stocks | risky category]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

For a 10-year period, the Nifty Small Cap Index has given a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. In comparison, the Nifty 50 Index yielded approximately 12.96% over the same 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This represents a substantial difference of close to 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Valuation: Understanding PE Ratio

Valuation helps investors determine whether a stock is overpriced, underpriced, or fairly priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. A common parameter used for valuation is the PE (Price-to-Earnings) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

*   **Calculation**: PE ratio is calculated by dividing the price of the stock by its earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Meaning**: The PE ratio indicates how much an investor is willing to pay for every unit of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. A lower PE ratio is generally considered better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

The PE ratio of the [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | small cap index]] is around 25.62 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. At this point, the index appears undervalued compared to active funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[0:11:07]</a>. The current PE ratio of the [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | small cap index]] is also lower than its five-year average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This suggests that the index is currently favorably priced for investors considering an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Grow Nifty Small Cap 250 Index Fund

The purpose of an index fund is to replicate or mirror an index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The challenge lies in accurately mirroring it due to "tracking error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Tracking error indicates how closely an index fund replicates the index; a lower tracking error signifies better mirroring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The weightage of an index's components constantly changes, primarily due to fluctuating stock prices, making 100% accuracy impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

Grow Mutual Fund has developed an in-house technology called "Spear" to reduce this tracking error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. While rebalancing in typical index funds occurs weekly or bi-weekly, Spear enables more frequent rebalancing, thereby reducing tracking error and ensuring the fund matches the index to a large extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## Who Should Consider Investing?

Investing in a [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | small cap index fund]] is suitable for investors with a [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_in_small_cap_stocks | high risk appetite]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. It is a good option for those who wish to invest in [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap stocks]] or [[small_cap_and_micro_cap_strategies | small cap funds]] but are uncertain about [[strategies_for_smallcap_and_midcap_stock_selection | selecting the right stock]] or actively managed fund themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. With an index fund, the investor doesn't need to pick individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

In addition to a [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_in_small_cap_stocks | high risk appetite]], a reasonably long investment horizon is also recommended for this type of fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

Investing a portion of a portfolio in gold has been a long-standing practice for many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Gold has recently delivered strong returns, with approximately 30% over the last year, surpassing the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This article explores [[different_ways_to_invest_in_gold | different ways to invest in gold]], focusing on a [[comparison_of_physical_gold_digital_gold_gold_etfs_and_gold_mutual_funds | comparison of Gold ETFs, physical gold, and Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)]].

## Why Invest in Gold?

Gold serves several key purposes in a portfolio:
*   **Portfolio Diversifier**: Gold acts as an effective [[gold_etfs_as_a_portfolio_diversifier | portfolio diversifier]] due to its low correlation with other asset classes like equities, helping to reduce portfolio volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Hedge Against Uncertainty**: It functions as a hedge during uncertain periods, preserving wealth during market corrections, conflicts, and economic instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The price of gold often moves inversely to inflation, interest rates, and currency depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Scarcity**: Gold is a rare commodity with limited unmined reserves, making it intrinsically valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Returns**: Globally, gold has delivered average returns of around 9% over the past 40-45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In the Indian context, this figure is closer to 7.5% to 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Downside Protection**: Gold helps cushion the impact during equity market downturns, such as the dot-com bubble, global financial crisis, or COVID-19 pandemic, protecting the downside for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Studies suggest that allocating a moderate amount (e.g., 15%) of gold can lower portfolio volatility and potentially increase returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs): A Shifting Landscape

While previously a popular option, [[understanding_sovereign_gold_bonds_sgbs | Sovereign Gold Bonds]] have become less attractive for the Indian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Since 2015, the government has raised over 70,000 crores through 67 tranches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, the last issuance was in February, with no new issues in the current financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. SGBs have proven to be an expensive borrowing tool for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has even announced premature redemption of 30 SGB tranches issued between May 2017 and March 2020 to discourage consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The government's disinterest, coupled with a reduction in gold import duty from 15% to 6%, has made other options like physical gold, digital gold, Gold ETFs, and gold mutual funds more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

Gold ETFs are a modern and increasingly popular way to invest in gold. The speaker makes a strong case for [[advantages_of_investing_in_gold_etfs | investing in gold via ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Features and Benefits of Gold ETFs
*   **Physical Backing**: Gold ETFs predominantly invest in physical gold (99.5% purity or higher) and gold-rated instruments, meaning ETF units are backed by actual physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This contrasts with SGBs, which are not physically backed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Price Parity**: Unlike physical gold, which can have varying prices across cities, Gold ETFs offer price parity, meaning the price remains consistent regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Low Ticket Sizes**: Investors can buy Gold ETFs for as little as 1/100th of a gram of gold, making it highly accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. For example, 1/100th of a gram can be as low as 78 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Demat Form**: ETF units are held in dematerialized (demat) form, eliminating concerns about theft or storage issues associated with physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Easy Transaction**: Gold ETFs can be bought and sold during market hours through a trading account without markups or limitations common with other alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Liquidity and Transparency**: Being listed on the stock exchange, Gold ETFs offer investors liquidity and transparency in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Collateral for Loans**: Gold ETFs can also serve as collateral for loans, adding financial utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### Gold ETF Valuation and Expenses
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has clear guidelines for valuing gold ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The value is based on the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) price, which is the global benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This price is then converted to Indian rupees by adding transportation costs from London, notional customs duties, taxes, and other import levies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Asset Management Companies (AMCs) appoint custodians and vaulting agencies for physical gold storage, incurring various expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. These costs, including transport, storage, handling, and insurance, are covered by the Gold ETF's expense ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. SEBI has capped the total expense ratio for Gold ETFs at 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Investors should also be aware of additional charges like demat charges, AMC charges, brokerage, and exchange transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Performance of Gold ETFs
Analysis of existing Gold ETFs shows minimal performance differences between schemes, usually within 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. As a category, Gold ETFs delivered about 28.12% in the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, and a more typical 13% over a trailing 5-year basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Gold's long-term return expectation is around 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Grow Gold ETF: A Recent Offering

The Grow Gold ETF is an open-ended exchange-traded fund designed to replicate the domestic price of physical gold, based on LBMA's daily spot fixing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. It aims to generate returns in line with the domestic price of physical gold, which is its benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

The ETF allocates 95% to 100% of its assets in physical gold and other gold-related instruments, with the remaining 0-5% in debt and money market instruments for managing redemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. It has no exit load, and its maximum total expense ratio (TER) is capped at 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Investors can purchase units as small as 0.01 gram of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> and participate in its New Fund Offer (NFO) with investments starting from 500 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Per the riskometer, the scheme and its benchmark are categorized as high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Recent Catalysts and Taxation

Gold ETFs have seen a surge in interest, with over 1,300 crores invested in July alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This rise is partly attributed to the recent reduction in customs duty on gold and recent budget announcements regarding tax rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The holding period for taxation has reportedly decreased, and tax rates have seen some relaxation in certain scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. However, it is recommended to consult a tax advisor for personalized advice on optimizing investment taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

The combination of tax changes, reduced customs duty, and the upcoming festive season makes the current timing opportune for investing in Gold ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. It is suggested that investors allocate 5% to 10% of their portfolio to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> to enhance risk-adjusted returns and benefit from stronger downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

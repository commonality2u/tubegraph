A significant concern for investors engaging in frequent buying and selling of securities is the brokerage fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. High brokerage costs can detrimentally affect an investor's profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Beyond reducing profitability, these fees can also discourage the implementation of crucial tactical moves in investing, such as using a stop-loss, [[methods_for_analyzing_and_managing_stock_portfolios | portfolio rebalancing]], or position averaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

Silver has been utilized for over 5,000 years as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Today, coins like the 2024 1 oz Silver Britannia, produced by the UK's Royal Mint, contain 1 ounce of 99.99% pure silver and are classified as British legal tender with a face value of £2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. However, their value, typically around £30, means they are often used as collectible items rather than for their face value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

Another traditional use of silver is in jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Excavations at Rakhigarhi indicate extensive use of silver in ornaments and utensils by the Harappan civilization 7,000 to 8,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Primary Driver: Industrial Demand

Despite its historical roles, silver's demand today is predominantly industrial, rather than being driven by jewelry or its function as a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. It is increasingly found in various modern technologies:
*   Mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>
*   Laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>
*   Space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>
*   Renewable energy solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>
*   Military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>

### Specific Industrial Applications

*   **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: EVs use twice the amount of silver compared to vehicles with internal combustion engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The growing EV market is expected to significantly increase silver demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Solar Panels**: Silver is a crucial component in making solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. A typical 3x5 foot solar panel can contain up to 20 grams of silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Solar manufacturers currently consume about 20% of the annual global silver supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. Projections suggest that by 2050, solar panel production could use anywhere from 85% to 98% of current global silver reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

India's silver imports surged to over 4,000 metric tons between January and April 2024, exceeding the 3,600 metric tons imported in all of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. The majority of this increase is attributed to the rising manufacturing of solar cells and modules in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Unlike gold, which is primarily used for jewelry and as a reserve, a significant portion of silver is consumed in these real-world applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

> The demand for [[increase_in_silver_demand_during_dhanteras | silver]] during Dhanteras in a recent year surpassed that of gold for the first time ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. While gold sales were down by about 15% from the previous year, silver demand surged by 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. This unusual shift occurred despite silver's price rising by an even higher 36% compared to gold's 28% rise in the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This demonstrates a greater adoption of silver even among households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

Investing in [[Understanding microcap stocks | microcap stocks]] evokes a range of emotions and can often lead to misunderstandings, making it crucial to examine the specific [[characteristics_of_microcap_investing | characteristics]] and the behavioral aspects required for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>. When dealing with microcap companies, an investor's own behavior is equally as important as the selection criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:25">[12:51:25]</a>. Several fundamental investing rules, though seemingly basic, are powerful and essential for navigating this segment of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:25">[12:55:25]</a>.

## Essential Investor Traits

### Patience and Long-Term View
[[Understanding microcap stocks | Microcap investing]] demands a significant amount of patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:25">[13:02:25]</a>. It can take years for the share price of a microcap company to reflect its true worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:25">[13:05:25]</a>. Investors often become impatient and sell their stocks prematurely, missing out on potential upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:25">[13:11:25]</a>.

### The Ability to Say No
A critical behavioral trait is the ability to decline potential investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:25">[13:17:25]</a>. Investors must be exceptionally selective and disciplined when choosing microcap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:25">[13:22:25]</a>.

### Phased Capital Deployment
It is advisable not to invest all capital at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:25">[13:28:25]</a>. Investor Ian Castle, a full-time microcap-focused investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:21">[08:19:21]</a>, suggests a three-phase investment approach:
*   **First third:** Invested after personal due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:25">[13:33:25]</a>.
*   **Second third:** Invested after meeting the management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:25">[13:38:25]</a>.
*   **Final third:** Invested after the management has executed at least 25% of their initial promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:25">[13:42:25]</a>.

This staggered approach allows an investor's conviction in a stock to grow steadily while averaging up their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:25">[13:48:25]</a>.

### Differentiating Business Performance from Stock Performance
It's crucial to distinguish between a company's business performance and its stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:25">[13:58:25]</a>. In microcaps, numerous scenarios exist where Earnings Per Share (EPS) might significantly increase over three years (e.g., by 30%, doubling earnings), yet the share price remains stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:25">[14:04:25]</a>. This often indicates undervaluation, and unless fundamental issues are present, it can be an opportune time to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:25">[14:17:25]</a>.

### Margin of Safety from Growth Potential
Applying a sufficient margin of safety is a vital lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:25">[14:24:25]</a>. For [[Understanding microcap stocks | microcap companies]], this margin refers to the company's growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:25">[14:32:25]</a>. Investors should seek businesses capable of growing their operations and profits by 300-500% over the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:25">[14:36:25]</a>.

## Beyond the Screener
While screeners can narrow down the vast universe of microcaps (e.g., from 3,000-4,000 to 21 potential stocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:24">[09:23:24]</a>, they are just the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:29">[10:26:29]</a>. A comprehensive fundamental analysis is required, which includes examining:
*   The last three years of annual reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:25">[10:44:25]</a>
*   Earnings transcripts from recent quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:25">[10:46:25]</a>
*   Any news surrounding the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:25">[10:48:25]</a>
*   Research reports by equity analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:25">[10:50:25]</a>

Investing in a [[Understanding microcap stocks | microcap]] goes beyond simply using a screener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:25">[14:50:25]</a>. Investors must dedicate time to thoroughly evaluate the management, the business model, and the company's growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:25">[14:55:25]</a>. A checklist can be beneficial for evaluating any small or microcap company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:25">[15:01:25]</a>.

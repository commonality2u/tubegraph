The "12.2 percent golden rule" is a self-created thumb rule that simplifies long-term investment planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. While not universally accepted, it can be a highly effective tool for quick calculations and decision-making in personal finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Rule
The core of the 12.2 percent rule is that one rupee, when compounded at 12.2 percent, will become ten rupees in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. This specific rate is often assumed to be India's long-term rate of return on equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications
This rule allows for creative and effective financial planning without the need for complex calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Retirement Planning Example
The rule can help in setting a base for retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. For instance, if one has accumulated one crore rupees, investing this amount in a diversified equity fund at 12.2 percent for 20 years would theoretically result in 10 crore rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

### Monthly Expense Planning for Retirement
Instead of focusing on a large retirement corpus, the rule can be applied to monthly expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
For example, if the estimated monthly expense in 20 years (at age 63) is 2 lakh rupees, investing 20,000 rupees today in a 12.2 percent fund has a decent likelihood of becoming 2 lakh rupees in exactly 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. This sequencing can be done monthly and adjusted annually (e.g., investing 21,000 rupees the next year) to account for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. This allows for a focus on future monthly needs rather than an overwhelming lump sum estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

## Benefits
The 12.2 percent golden rule offers a simplified approach to financial planning, particularly for long-term goals like retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. It helps clarify financial objectives by providing a clear relationship between current investments and future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. The speaker has personally used this rule in various situations and found it to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

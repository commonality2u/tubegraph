Asset allocation is a phrase commonly used among financial planners and YouTubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In a nutshell, it is the process of diversifying one's investment portfolio across different asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Core Principles of Asset Allocation

Two key words define asset allocation: "process" and "diversify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Process
Employing any [[asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation strategy]] requires following a series of steps or a system to derive the maximum advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The primary aim of asset allocation is to provide investors with a better, higher [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | risk-adjusted return]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Traditionally, return and risk are positively correlated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The purpose of asset allocation is to improve this return-risk equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Graphically, this means a portfolio should either achieve a higher return for the same level of risk, or the same level of returns at a lower portfolio risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Both scenarios represent an improvement in your [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | risk-adjusted portfolio return]], which is the true goal of asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Diversify
Diversification doesn't simply mean owning different assets, but rather having *diversified* assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. For example, while a Nifty 50 Index Fund (large cap) and a Nifty Mid Cap 150 Index may seem like different assets, their performance is tightly correlated over long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A portfolio consisting solely of these two does not truly serve asset allocation goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

True diversification involves using asset classes that are negatively or at least weakly correlated to each other in terms of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Gold, for instance, often shows divergent performance compared to equity indices, exemplifying genuine diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Summary of Good Asset Allocation
Good asset allocation is:
*   A process-driven approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Makes use of diversified assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Aims to improve the portfolio's [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | risk-adjusted return]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Types of Asset Allocation Approaches
The video introduces five different [[asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation strategies]], each serving a different objective and investor persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:

1.  **Age-Based Asset Allocation**: Determines equity allocation based on the investor's age, such as the [[asset_allocation_using_the_100_minus_age_rule | 100 minus age rule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This approach is a starting point but is not considered scientific or recommended as it doesn't factor in investment goals or risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
2.  [[strategic_asset_allocation_factors | **Strategic Asset Allocation**]]: Involves dividing a portfolio based on criteria like age, time horizon, financial goals, number of dependents, income stability, and risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. When done well, it improves [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | risk-adjusted returns]] and makes the financial side of life more peaceful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
3.  [[core_satellite_asset_allocation_method | **Core Satellite Asset Allocation Method**]]: Divides a portfolio into a core holding of broadly diversified investments for stability and reduced risk, and a satellite holding of more focused, higher-return investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
4.  **Risk-Based Asset Allocation Strategy**: Matches an investor's risk profile (e.g., conservative, income, balanced, growth, aggressive) with a bouquet of asset classes, each with its own return and risk level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The proportion of equities typically rises as the risk profile moves from conservative to aggressive, while debt levels decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
5.  [[dynamic_and_tactical_asset_allocation_strategies | **Dynamic and Tactical Asset Allocation**]]:
    *   **Dynamic Asset Allocation**: Involves making changes to asset allocation based on predefined rules or algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, often shifting money between equity, debt, and gold to maintain a balance between return and risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This style is more strategic, model-based, and long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, and generally more passive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   **Tactical Asset Allocation**: Requires making frequent adjustments based on market opportunities and economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. It is short-term in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> and requires a higher level of active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, using a greater number of variables like interest rates, valuation, inflation, and geopolitical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

Ultimately, a personalized [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation strategy]] should combine the best parts of these techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This involves dividing goals into separate strategies, choosing diverse assets with low correlation, finding a sweet spot for allocation percentages, and periodic monitoring with adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

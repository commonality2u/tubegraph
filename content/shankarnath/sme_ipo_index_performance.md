The SME IPO Index has shown remarkable performance, significantly outperforming broader market indices like the Nifty, Sensex, and BSE 500, which typically constitute a diversified set of companies and offer returns of 12% to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Historical Performance of the SME IPO Index
The [[historical_performance_and_valuation_of_small_cap_index | performance]] of the SME IPO index has been notably strong:
*   **Last 1 year:** It delivered a return of 126% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Last 5 years:** An investment of 1 rupee in this index was converted into 20 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **3-year CAGR:** The S&P BSE SME IPO index has clocked a three-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 193% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **5-year CAGR:** It achieved an 82% CAGR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **10-year annualized return:** The index delivered a 60% annualized return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Long-term Growth:** An investment of 1 lakh rupees in this index in 2013 would have swelled to over 1 crore rupees today, representing a 100x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This demonstrates significant [[performance_comparison_with_market_indices | outperformance compared to other indices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### Examples of Significant Gains
Individual companies have also shown remarkable gains:
*   Krishka Strapping Solutions achieved a 400% gain, having been oversubscribed 337 times at the time of its issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Impact on Investment Interest
The strong [[performance_and_execution_of_investments_in_small_and_mid_cap_stocks | recent performance]] of SME stocks has substantially boosted interest in this asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This led to a significant increase in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) from 27 in 2020 to 109 in 2022, with almost 200 new listings expected in the current financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The underlying premise is that small stocks have the potential to create big rewards for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Risks and Factors Affecting Performance
While the returns are attractive, it's important to consider the [[risks_and_rewards_of_investing_in_sme_ipos | risks]] associated with SME investing.
*   **Volatility:** SME stocks are inherently more volatile and riskier compared to main board stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Fragility:** SMEs are by nature very fragile, and it is not uncommon for many IPOs to trade 80-95% below their issue price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This is often due to companies failing to see significant improvement after fundraising, influenced by their business environment, competition, government policies, and growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Migration to Main Board:** Historically, not all SME IPOs successfully migrate to the main board. For example, none of the six SME IPOs from FY 2012 had made it to the main board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Information Availability:** There is generally less information available for SME stocks compared to main board stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Benefits and Growth Potential
Despite the risks, the SME sector offers significant growth potential:
*   **Growth Capital:** A large chunk of the capital raised by SMEs through IPOs (typically 20-50 crores) goes in as growth capital, which is utilized towards increasing the company's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This capital can help SMEs scale up their revenues and profits by 50%, 100%, or even 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** The SME IPO index also offers the added advantage of diversification, which can potentially improve a portfolio's risk-adjusted return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Migration and Liquidity:** The migration of SME stocks to the main board is a key driver for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Over one-third of companies listed on the BSE SME index (442 listed) and NSE Emerge (333 listed) have already migrated to the main board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This migration can lead to high returns and offers a desirable exit or liquidity to the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The increasing investment by domestic institutional investors, foreign investors, and mutual funds in SME stocks also contributes to greater liquidity and buoyancy within the SME exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

When selecting mutual funds, it's easy to fall into common pitfalls. Based on personal experience and observations, here are key areas to be mindful of to improve your [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing patterns and strategies]] and avoid [[common_investment_mistakes | common investment mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Over-Diversification: Too Many Schemes
A significant mistake many investors make, including the speaker, is investing in too many schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For example, the speaker currently holds 70 schemes, an acknowledged mistake he is trying to rectify, though [[risk_management_in_investing | taxation]] can complicate pruning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The ideal number of schemes chosen should be manageable, typically four to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Specific Fund Types and Strategies to Reconsider
While not universal rules, the speaker suggests thinking twice before engaging in certain [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing patterns and strategies]] based on his [[challenges_and_lessons_in_investing | challenges and lessons in investing]]:

*   **SIP by regular plans** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
*   **Investing through the NFO process** (New Fund Offer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   **Using sectoral funds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
*   **Credit risk funds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   **Debt funds with low AUM** (Assets Under Management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

## Over-Reliance on Historical Performance
A common tendency is to excessively scrutinize historical returns, such as one-year, three-year, five-year, or ten-year trailing and rolling returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. While past performance is often considered, it's advised not to focus too much on these details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. A better approach is to prioritize consistency over the benchmark, accepting periods where performance might dip below it for a year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### The "Two-Two-One" Approach
This approach for [[overview_of_common_factors_in_investing | Equity Fund selection]] suggests that over the last five years, a scheme ideally:
*   Was "well above the benchmark" in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>
*   Was "somewhat around the benchmark" in another two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
*   May have been "below the benchmark" in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>

This method emphasizes consistency and helps avoid making decisions based on short-term market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Sector Concentration or Excessive Diversification
While a fund manager's conviction might lead them to concentrate on five or six sectors, it's generally advisable to avoid funds that:
*   Are betting on just one sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
*   Are betting on too many (e.g., 15 different sectors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>

## Fixation on the Lowest Expense Ratio
While expense ratios are important, being a "stickler for the lowest expense ratio" might be a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. An expense ratio of less than one percent is considered reasonable, as it provides enough incentive for the fund management team to conduct thorough research and stock analysis without cutting corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Building Your Own Investment Framework
The goal is not to rely on lists of specific funds, but to develop a personalized [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investment philosophy and strategy]] and framework that aligns with your present conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This includes clearly defining your asset allocation, understanding fund managers' [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing styles]], focusing on consistency over benchmarks, and avoiding specific fund types that may not suit your risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

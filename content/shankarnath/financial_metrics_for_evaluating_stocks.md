Dr. Vijay Malik, a full-time equity investor since 2016, has created a "final checklist for buying stocks" that provides rules and guidelines for informed investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This checklist is broken down into four primary categories: [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | financial metrics]], [[business_operations_metrics_in_stock_analysis | business parameters]], [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation-related numbers]], and company management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Financial Metrics for Stock Evaluation

Dr. Malik's checklist begins with eight key [[financial_metrics_for_investing_in_hospital_stocks | financial metrics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>:

1.  **Sales Growth**: Dr. Malik prefers a sales growth of at least 15% over a 7-10 year period, with consistent growth (no large spikes or drops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
2.  **Net Profit Margin**: The checklist requires a net profit margin of at least 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
3.  **Tax Payout**: Companies should have a tax rate close to the general corporate tax rate, with 25% considered a more suitable number than the previously suggested 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  **Interest Coverage Ratio**: This ratio, indicating a company's ability to service its debt, should be at least 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. A higher ratio is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
5.  **Debt to Equity Ratio**: Dr. Malik suggests this ratio should be less than 0.5 to indicate that a company is not over-leveraged and can avoid significant problems during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
6.  **Current Ratio**: To assess a company's ability to pay short-term liabilities with short-term assets (cash, inventory, receivables), the current ratio should be at least 1.25 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
7.  **Positive Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)**: The company must consistently generate positive CFO over periods like one, three, and five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
8.  **Comparison of Profit After Tax (PAT) with Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)**: When CFO is close to net profits, it indicates that reported earnings are backed by actual cash inflows from core operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Significant divergence might suggest aggressive revenue recognition, working capital changes (e.g., lenient credit terms), or a high percentage of non-cash items like depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. A deviation of no more than plus or minus 20% between operational cash flows and net profit is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Applying these [[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | financial ratios]] to a universe of over 4300 companies initially narrowed the list to just 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Business Operations Metrics

The second set of [[business_operations_metrics_in_stock_analysis | metrics]] focuses on the business and its operations, encompassing five factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>:

1.  **Sales Growth vs. Industry Peers**: A company's sales growth should be higher than its competitors, indicating an economic moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
2.  **Increase in Production Capacity and Sales Volume**: Companies should show an increase in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
3.  **Conversion of Sales Growth into Profit Growth**: Sales growth and profit growth should be aligned; profits should not grow while sales are flat, nor should sales grow significantly faster than profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
4.  **Conversion of Profits into Cash**: This reiterates the importance of operating cash flow being in close proximity to net profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
5.  **Creation of Shareholder Value from Retained Profits**: The increase in market capitalization over the last 10 years should be greater than the increase in retained earnings, indicating effective use of retained profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Management Analysis

Analyzing management involves checking several aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>:

1.  **Background Check**: Investigate the background of the company's promoters and directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
2.  **Succession Plan**: Examine the fairness and capability of the company's succession plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
3.  **Promoter's Salary**: The promoter's salary should not be disproportionate to the company's profits (e.g., increasing when profits decline) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
4.  **Project Execution Skills**: The company should demonstrate strong project execution capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
5.  **Dividends**: Dividends should have consistently increased over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
6.  **Promoter Shareholding**: A high promoter shareholding, at least 51%, is considered favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
7.  **Insider Buying**: The promoter should be buying more shares in the company, indicating confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
8.  **Foreign Institutional Shareholding (FII)**: Low FII shareholding (less than 20%) is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### Valuation Metrics

The final category in Dr. Malik's checklist covers six [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation metrics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>:

1.  **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Multiple)**: This can be analyzed on a historical basis and compared against the industry or sector's P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
2.  **[[evaluating_stocks_using_peg_and_pe_ratios | PEG Ratio]]**: If the [[evaluating_stocks_using_peg_and_pe_ratios | PEG ratio]] is above one, the company is considered overvalued; if below one, it suggests undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
3.  **Earnings Yield**: This number should ideally be higher than the yield on a 10-year government bond, as it represents the return on an equity instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Earnings yield is the inverse of the P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
4.  **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book Value)**: Dr. Malik prefers companies with a P/B ratio of less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
5.  **Price to Sales Ratio**: Referencing James O'Shaughnessy, Dr. Malik advises investing if this ratio is less than 1.5 and selling if it exceeds 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
6.  **Dividend Yield**: While a dividend yield of 5% is highly desirable, investors should not focus too much on this if the company is growing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

#### Relaxing Valuation Parameters

Dr. Malik suggests that out of the four categories (financial, business, management, and [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuations]]), the [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation]] parameter can be relaxed slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The first three categories help identify a fundamentally strong company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. If the price becomes a bit expensive, it primarily means adjusting down return expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

This checklist serves as a strong starting point for [[financial_metrics_for_identifying_compounders | identifying stocks]] using [[stock_screening_platforms and financial metrics | standard screeners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

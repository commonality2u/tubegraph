When planning for retirement, it is crucial to consider the impact of inflation on your expenses and the longevity of your savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:51">[09:45:51]</a>.

## Inflation's Role in Post-Retirement Expenses

After retiring, an individual's income drops to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:44">[10:02:44]</a>. While it's assumed one would tighten their spending from pre-retirement levels (e.g., from an 80% expense rate to 60% of the 60th year's expenses, or 96 lakhs in a simulated example) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:50">[09:50:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:21">[10:01:21]</a>, these expenses are not static <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. This initial post-retirement expense amount will increase every year due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:20">[10:22:20]</a>. For instance, with an assumed inflation rate of 7% per annum, 96 lakhs in the 61st year becomes 1.03 crores the following year, and 1.1 crores the year after, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:26">[10:24:26]</a>.

## Impact on Corpus Longevity

Even with a portfolio continuing to generate returns (e.g., 10% annual return assumed in a simulation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:48">[10:35:48]</a>, the rising expenses caused by inflation can significantly affect how long a retirement corpus lasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:07">[10:42:07]</a>. In a simulated scenario where a person accumulated 16 crores by age 60, expenses increasing due to inflation eventually "catch up" to the portfolio's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:03">[10:36:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:07">[10:42:07]</a>. This can lead to the entire retirement fund being depleted, for example, by the age of 82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:04">[10:47:04]</a>.

It is important for individuals to exercise judgment and prudence in managing their spending, duration of active work, and the remaining amount of money to ensure their savings last through their post-retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:13">[10:52:13]</a>. When using financial planning tools, it is advisable to tweak the numbers and formulas to suit one's own situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:58">[11:06:58]</a>.

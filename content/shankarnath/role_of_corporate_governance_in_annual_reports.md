An annual report is a legally required document that publicly traded companies provide to shareholders yearly, detailing operations, performance, and financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a>. This document is crucial for [[understanding_annual_reports|understanding annual reports]] and assessing a company's health.

The [[key_components_of_annual_reports|annual report]] includes a dedicated **Corporate Governance Report**, which is a critical section for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24"></a>.

## Understanding Corporate Governance

[[corporate_restructuring_benefits|Corporate governance]] is defined as a system of rules and processes designed to balance the interests of various stakeholders, including shareholders, management, customers, suppliers, and the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28"></a>.

## Board of Directors

The first section within the Corporate Governance Report focuses on the board of directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42"></a>. Investors should examine:
*   **Share Ownership**: How many board members own shares in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49"></a>.
*   **Conflict of Interest**: Potential conflicts of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53"></a>.
*   **Skills and Competencies**: The board members' expertise in areas like finance, compliance, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57"></a>.

Ideally, a strong board should:
*   Have an ideal size, typically between 8 and 10 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39"></a>.
*   Maintain a balance of executive and non-executive directors, ideally 50% of each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44"></a>.
*   Have a majority of independent outsiders who are experienced business leaders with no direct company connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49"></a>.
*   Ensure the MD or CEO and the chairman of the board are two separate individuals, which improves governance and reduces conflict of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58"></a>.

## Key Committees

The Corporate Governance Report also provides details on several committees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04"></a>. Two particularly important committees for investors are:

### Audit Committee
The audit committee works with the company's Auditors to ensure that financial reporting processes and financial statements are accurate, sufficient, and credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13"></a>. Its key responsibilities include monitoring and flagging issues such as:
*   Sales numbers inconsistent with purchases or inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29"></a>.
*   Revenue recognition in a non-standardized manner (e.g., as seen with Byju's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35"></a>.
*   Financial reporting not adhering to defined policies, like depreciation calculation or expense capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41"></a>.
Ideally, this committee should include only non-executive, and preferably independent, directors to oversee the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50"></a>.

### Nomination and Remuneration Committee
This committee has two main functions:
1.  Formulating policies for identifying individuals who qualify for directorship or senior management positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03"></a>.
2.  Defining the rules for compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11"></a>.

It is important that the CEO or an executive director is not part of this committee, and ideally, all committee members should be independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41"></a>. Cases of excessive compensation (e.g., Sun TV Networks in FY21, where two executive directors drew 57% of the company's profit) highlight the importance of this committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16"></a>.

## Related Party Transactions (RPTs)

Companies are required to disclose details of any transactions made with a related party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29"></a>. A related party transaction (RPT) occurs between two parties joined by a special relationship prior to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05"></a>. This could include:
*   Transactions benefiting a relative of the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15"></a>.
*   Agreements between companies with a common promoter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17"></a>.
*   Sale or purchase transactions between a parent company and its subsidiary or joint venture partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23"></a>.

While RPTs can be a gray area, investors should apply common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37"></a>. If a significant portion of a company's sales revenue (e.g., 20%) comes from a related party, or if it buys a large percentage of raw materials (e.g., 50%) from one, this definitely qualifies as an RPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45"></a>. Such transactions should be scrutinized to ensure they are conducted at "arms length" (fair market terms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59"></a>.

For a broader [[analysis_of_financial_statements|analysis of financial statements]], always check the notes to financial statements, as they contain real information on accounting policies, asset valuation, revenue reporting, and [[using_shareholder_information_for_investment_decisions|shareholder information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19"></a>.

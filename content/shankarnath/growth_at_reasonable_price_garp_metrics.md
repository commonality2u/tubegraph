[[GARP Investing Strategy | Growth at Reasonable Price (GARP)]] is an investing style that sits between [[Comparison of Growth and Value Investing | value and growth investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>. It seeks to combine the mindset of both approaches to offer a balance between undervalued companies and high-growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The term [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] was popularized by famous investor Peter Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The focus of [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] is not on finding cheap companies, but rather on identifying companies where growth is being underpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Foundational Metrics in GARP

The [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] framework heavily revolves around growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### Measuring Growth

Growth can be viewed in two primary ways:

*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth:** Investing in companies that have rapidly grown their EPS over recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Historically, this strategy has not always performed as well as expected, largely because a company's growth rate is subject to change over time, making it an unpredictable factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue Growth:** It is generally better to prioritize revenue growth, as it tends to be more sustainable and correlated over time compared to EPS growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

When examining EPS, it is advisable to rely as much as possible on future growth rather than historical growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

### The PEG Ratio

A crucial metric integral to the [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] style is the Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

*   **Calculation:** The PEG ratio is derived by dividing a company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio by its EPS growth rate (the rise in earnings per share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   **Peter Lynch's Definition:** A PEG ratio close to one is considered by Peter Lynch to indicate a fairly valued business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Modern View:** In today's generally low-interest rate environment, modern [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] investors might consider a stock attractive if its PEG ratio is two or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Utility:**
    *   **In Isolation:** If the PEG ratio is low (e.g., lower than one), the business might be considered undervalued based on its earnings forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Relative Basis:** It facilitates comparisons between different stocks. For example, comparing a stock with a P/E of 20 and 30% profit growth versus another with a P/E of 10 and 8% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Considerations:** When applying the PEG ratio, one should always account for cyclicity in the P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

## Additional Parameters for a Robust GARP Strategy

Beyond growth and the PEG ratio, it is highly recommended to strengthen the [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] approach with additional parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>:

*   **Debt Ratio:** The total liabilities divided by total assets should ideally not exceed 25%, as suggested by Peter Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Moats:** The business should possess one or more strong economic moats to ensure sustainability and protect profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Promoter Shareholding:** A high and significant promoter shareholding is often seen as a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Circle of Competence:** Investors should be clear about the businesses they understand and want to explore, and those they prefer to avoid, based on personal preferences and their circle of competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

## Different Approaches to GARP Strategy

Since there is no single defined [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] method, various approaches exist, often utilizing different [[Financial metrics for evaluating stocks | financial metrics]] and criteria for [[Evaluating stock market metrics for investment decisions | stock selection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

### 1. A Invest.com Screener (Iteration 1)

This simple screener uses three variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>:
*   Market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>
*   PEG ratio (0 to 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>
*   EPS growth rate (e.g., 20% in an Indian context) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>
*   Adjusted market cap (e.g., 10,000 crores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>

A replicated version, using historical 3-year P/E and 3-year EPS growth, resulted in a list of 83 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This portfolio delivered an astounding one-year return of 113% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

### 2. Ish Mohit's GARP Framework (Iteration 2)

This framework, focusing on larger businesses (market cap over 50,000 crores), includes:
*   Year-on-year quarterly sales growth of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>
*   Year-on-year quarterly profit growth of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>
*   P/E multiple of less than 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>

This query yielded 16 entries, mostly banking and NBFC stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. While this methodology did not explicitly use the PEG ratio, 62% of the resulting stocks had a PEG ratio between 0 and 1, and another 21% had a PEG ratio between 1 and 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. This framework managed a 110% return over the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

### 3. Economic Times Framework (Iteration 3)

This approach uses a six-point criteria for [[identifying_high_growth_potential_companies | GARP]] stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>:
*   Market cap over 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>
*   Sales revenue over 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>
*   5-year profit growth of at least 15% (historical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>
*   Expected future profit growth of 15% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>
*   PEG ratio of less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>
*   Minimum of five analysts covering the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>

When put on a screener, this query yielded 131 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. A small portfolio from this framework showed an annual return of 51% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

### 4. S&P 500 GARP Index (Iteration 4)

This documented [[different_approaches_to_garp_strategy | GARP]] strategy tracks companies adhering to S&P's definition of a [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. It incorporates five factors:
*   **Growth Variables:**
    *   3-year EPS growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>
    *   3-year SPS (Sales Per Share) growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>
*   **Quality and Value Composite Factors:**
    *   **Financial Leverage Ratio:** Total debt divided by the company's Book Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Return on Equity (ROE):** 12-month trailing EPS divided by Book Value Per Share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Earnings to Price Ratio:** 12-month trailing EPS divided by the stock's current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

## Designing a Custom GARP Framework

A comprehensive [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] framework can be designed by combining various elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>:

*   **Market Cap:** Capping at nothing below 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.
*   **Sales:** Minimum sales level of at least 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.
*   **PEG Ratio:** Acceptable range between 0 and 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Growth:** 1, 3, and 5-year Sales CAGR of at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   **EPS Growth:** 1, 3, and 5-year EPS CAGR of 15% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>.
*   **Expected Profits:** Ensuring the next quarter's earnings are higher than the last year's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

This custom query resulted in a list of 27 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. Characteristics of this list included high sales and profit growth, diverse P/E ratios due to the PEG ratio focus, and a broad sectoral spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. The average promoter holding was around 55%, and the interest coverage ratio was comfortably above three in most cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. This custom [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] portfolio would have delivered 115% in returns over the last one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.

>[!info] Key Takeaway

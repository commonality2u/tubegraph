Predicting which market index or sector will perform best in the coming year is challenging, as historical performance varies significantly year-to-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Identifying winning companies becomes increasingly difficult as the economy grows and more companies get listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | Multicap funds]] are a category of schemes designed to make this task easier for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Understanding Flexicap Funds

A [[investing_in_flexi_cap_and_factorbased_funds | flexicap]] fund allows the fund manager to allocate any proportion or percentage of assets across large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For instance, a fund manager could allocate 80% to large caps, 20% to mid-caps, and nothing to small caps, or any of hundreds of other combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This structure provides the fund manager flexibility to allocate across market caps based on their best judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

However, a perceived issue with flexicap funds was the lack of a single mutual fund category that an investor could access to build a truly diversified portfolio across all market capitalizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Understanding Multicap Funds

Recognizing the need for a truly multi-cap combination, [[sebi_regulations_on_multicap_funds | SEBI]] (the Securities and Exchange Board of India) mandated the creation of a separate multicap funds category in September 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Under these [[sebi_regulations_on_multicap_funds | SEBI regulations]], every multicap scheme must invest at least 25% of its assets in each of the three market cap categories:
*   25% or more in large caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   25% or more in mid-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   25% or more in small caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

While this may seem restrictive, fund managers still retain flexibility in deciding the overall allocation for the remaining percentage (e.g., opting for 50-25-25, 40-30-30, or 33-33-33, and so on) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A key benefit is that the fund manager can select specific stocks within all three categories (large caps, mid-caps, and small caps), aiming to invest in the most ideal companies within each segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Benefits of Multicap Funds

[[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | Multicap funds]] offer several advantages:
*   **Diversification**: They ensure compulsory exposure across large, mid, and small market capitalizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Market Navigation**: They effectively navigate the dynamic nature of the Indian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Performance and Volatility**: They have demonstrated good performance and managed volatility effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Disciplined Investing**: Investing through multicaps encourages a more disciplined approach to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Performance Analysis

[[performance_analysis_of_multicap_indices | Multicap funds]] are typically actively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The most suitable benchmark for most multicap schemes is the Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25 index, as it aligns closely with how multicap funds are designed, unlike the Nifty 500, which is predominantly large-cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

In terms of performance, the multicap index has generally outperformed both the Nifty 500 and the Nifty 50 on a trailing basis across many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. On an SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) basis, there has historically been a 1.5% to 2% alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Rolling returns data indicates that average and median returns have consistently stayed in the 13% range, which is 1% to 1.5% higher than the Nifty 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For long-term periods (7, 10, 15 years), there's a strong probability of achieving returns in the 12% to 16% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

When compared to other indices such as small cap, midcap, and Nifty 100, the Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25 index typically shows a "middling" second or third rank performance over various years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This consistent, balanced performance highlights its role in managing volatility while providing robust returns.

### Example: The GROWW Multicap Fund

The [[groww_multicap_fund_nfo_details_and_strategy | GROWW Multicap Fund]], similar to other schemes in its category, will allocate at least 25% to each of the three market cap bands (large, mid, small) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The remaining 25% will be allocated dynamically based on market conditions, with a focus on growth opportunities across large, mid, or small-cap sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The fund aims to identify growth pockets, with a particular emphasis on small-cap stocks that have improved in quality due to better access to talent and capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Other growth opportunities on the fund's radar include:
*   Resurgence in exports with government support and China's decreasing dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>
*   The rise of consumption and premiumization in sectors like real estate, auto, and jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   Financialization of savings and increasing retail participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
*   Large-scale infrastructure pushes (e.g., national infrastructure pipeline, smart cities mission, affordable housing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
*   Import substitution and "Made in India" initiatives aimed at boosting domestic production and reducing import dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>

The [[groww_multicap_fund_nfo_details_and_strategy | GROWW Multicap Fund]] aims to capitalize on India's growth by positioning itself in sectors and companies likely to perform well in the near to moderate term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The NFO (New Fund Offer) for this fund is open until December 10th, with a minimum investment of 100 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. It carries an exit load of 1% if redeemed within one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, and like all pure equity schemes, it is labeled as "very high risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. A minimum investment horizon of at least 5 years is suggested for such funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

While [[investing_in_flexi_cap_and_factorbased_funds | flexicap]] funds offer fund managers broad flexibility, [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | multicap funds]], with their mandated minimum allocations across market capitalizations, provide a structural advantage for true diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This construct can help investors navigate the dynamic Indian stock market, delivering consistent performance with managed volatility, making them a strong component for long-term wealth creation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

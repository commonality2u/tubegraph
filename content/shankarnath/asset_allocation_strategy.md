Picking mutual funds should not be a random process, but instead, should align with a clear [[introduction_to_asset_allocation|asset allocation]] mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16">[01:16]</a>. The funds selected should properly fit into your desired [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management|asset allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23">[01:23]</a>.

## Defining Your Asset Allocation Mix

The investor suggests that he would make a separate video on how to allocate across assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25">[01:25]</a>. After extensive experimentation, the investor found comfort with a 65-35 equity to non-equity mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30">[01:30]</a>. This approach is similar to structuring a portfolio like a balanced or aggressive hybrid fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39">[01:39]</a>.

### Flexibility in Asset Allocation

While a 65-35 mix is a comfortable starting point, the investor remains flexible, having adjusted their equity allocation as high as 75% and as low as 45% on various occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45">[01:45]</a>.

Instead of trying to time the market, the investor prefers to play the odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56">[01:56]</a>:
*   When equities are depressed, money is transferred from debt to equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01">[02:01]</a>.
*   When equities appear overvalued, some funds are moved from less favored equity schemes into debt or Arbitrage funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[02:05]</a>.

This [[dynamic_and_tactical_asset_allocation_strategies|dynamic approach]] is not for maximizing returns but for personal comfort and peace of mind regarding the portfolio's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16">[02:16]</a>. As of the recording, the investor's portfolio was at 58% equity and 42% non-equity (primarily debt with some gold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25">[02:25]</a>.

### Equity Portfolio Breakdown

For simplicity, the investor uses a 60-40 equity-non-equity ratio as a base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36">[02:36]</a>. The 60% equity portion is further diversified into large caps, mid caps, small caps, and international investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40">[02:40]</a>.

The investor's ideal equity split for comfort is 50% in large caps, 20% in mid caps, 20% in small caps, and 10% in international funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47">[02:47]</a>.

> [!INFO] Rationale for Equity Allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00">[03:00]</a>
> *   **Large Caps (50%):** Provide stability to the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00">[03:00]</a>.
> *   **Mid & Small Caps (40% combined):** Act as a fertile ground for "multibaggers" (stocks with significant growth potential) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05">[03:05]</a>.
> *   **International Funds (10%):** Satisfy diversification needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11">[03:11]</a>.

This translates to an overall portfolio breakdown (based on a 60% equity, 40% debt structure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15">[03:15]</a>:
*   Large Caps: 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19">[03:19]</a>
*   Mid Caps: 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21">[03:21]</a>
*   Small Caps: 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21">[03:21]</a>
*   International: 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23">[03:23]</a>
*   Debt: 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24">[03:24]</a>

This specific mix is the investor's "comfort zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25">[03:25]</a>.

### Individualized Approach to Asset Allocation

It is crucial to recognize that your personal [[strategic_asset_allocation_factors|portfolio mix]] will likely differ from the investor's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28">[03:28]</a>. This is because individual factors such as income, savings patterns, investing habits, risk profile, and instrument preferences are distinct for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34">[03:34]</a>.

For example, the investor notes that a majority of their small cap investing is via direct stocks rather than mutual funds, while large cap and a good proportion of mid cap investments are primarily through mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45">[03:45]</a>.

## Connecting Asset Allocation to Fund Selection

The goal is to choose schemes that align with your preferred asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35">[10:35]</a>. The investor provides examples of their current SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) and how they fit into their [[portfolio_asset_allocation_with_two_funds|asset allocation]] preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27">[10:27]</a>:

*   **Large Caps (30% of total portfolio):** No actively managed large cap fund currently. Instead, investments are in a factor-based fund, a flexi cap fund, a multi-cap fund, and an ELSS fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38">[10:38]</a>.
*   **Mid Caps:** One SIP in a factor-based scheme and another in an actively managed mid cap fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54">[10:54]</a>.
*   **Small Caps:** An actively managed small cap fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03">[11:03]</a>.
*   **International Funds:** One actively managed international fund and one index-based international fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08">[11:08]</a>.

The specific names of the funds are not disclosed, as the purpose is to provide a framework for decision-making rather than specific recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15">[11:15]</a>. Many of these SIPs have been held for over five years, with no current reason to exit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33">[11:33]</a>.

## Long-Term Perspective

Data suggests that the longer you stay invested in a fund, the less critical the scheme's original selection becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40">[11:40]</a>. For example, a table of flexi cap funds showed that, excluding outliers, nine schemes' 10-year SIP performance fell within a 1.5% to 2% range of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49">[11:49]</a>.

This data-driven insight helps the investor focus less on historical returns and more on how a scheme fits into their overall [[asset_allocation_strategies|asset allocation]], the fund manager's investing style, performance consistency, and sector participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03">[12:03]</a>.

> Picking mutual funds is ultimately about understanding a framework that can be customized to your present conditions, allowing you to make informed decisions for yourself every single time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53">[12:53]</a>.

[[tactical_approaches_to_maximize_small_cap_investment_performance | Small cap investing]] can be a tactical approach to maximize investment performance, especially when compared to investing solely in large or mid caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:31">[08:04:31]</a>. While Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are advocated even in [[basics_of_small_cap_investing | small caps]], leveraging their volatility can significantly improve returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:31">[08:14:31]</a>.

## Performance Comparison: Large Caps vs. Small Caps vs. Combined

Investing a consistent amount monthly since 2007 would have yielded the following returns:
*   **Large Cap Index**: 12.8% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Small Cap Index**: 13.8% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Combined Large and Small Cap Indices**: 16.3% return, which is significantly higher than either asset class in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. This strategy aims to achieve an extra 2-3% on capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Investment Interest and Strategy

External events and their perception heavily influence investment interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>. Investors often shift between large caps during uncertain periods (e.g., 2009, 2013, 2020) and [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | small caps]] during bullish years (e.g., 2007, 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. A relative valuation range of 0.9 to 1.1 serves as an important stock picking trigger that can be utilized to an investor's advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:20">[01:34:20]</a>.

## Data Collection for Developing a Model

To develop an investment model, the first step is to collect the month-closing values of the Nifty 50 and the Nifty Small Cap 250 Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:20">[01:43:20]</a>. This data can be found on the NSE India website by navigating to "products," then "equities," and clicking on the "historical index data" link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:20">[01:52:20]</a>. After selecting "total returns index value" and specifying the index and time period, daily index values are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:20">[02:04:20]</a>. Monthly closing values for the last 15 years for both Nifty 50 and Nifty Small Cap 250 are also compiled in a Google Sheet linked in the video's description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.

## Investing Scenarios and Strategies

The Google Sheet also contains data for various investing scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:20">[02:29:20]</a>.

### Scenario 1: Individual Index Performance

Using the XIRR formula, the annualized returns for the past 15 years are:
*   Nifty 50 TRI: 12.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:20">[02:54:20]</a>.
*   Nifty Small Cap 250 TRI: 13.8% CAGR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:20">[03:01:20]</a>.

A 10,000 rupee monthly SIP over this period would have grown to:
*   Nifty 50: 55.5 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:20">[03:11:20]</a>.
*   Small Cap 250 Index: Over 60 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:20">[03:16:20]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Pausing SIPs in Overvalued Periods

This scenario involves pausing SIPs in months where the small cap relative valuation crosses an upper limit of 1.1, indicating that [[understanding_microcap_stocks | small caps]] are overvalued compared to large caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:20">[03:31:20]</a>. In this study, this exclusion applied to 23 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:20">[03:44:20]</a>. By not investing capital in these expensive months, the annualized return showed a slight improvement to 14.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:20">[03:54:20]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Selling in Overvalued Periods

Instead of just pausing SIPs, this strategy involves selling units when [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | small caps]] become expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:20">[04:15:20]</a>. For instance, selling 10,000 rupees worth of units whenever the small cap level crosses 1.1 can provide an additional 0.3% lift, taking the annual return to 14.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:20">[04:28:20]</a>.

### Scenario 4: Buy Low, Sell High (Dynamic Strategy)

This comprehensive strategy involves both selling when [[strategies_for_smallcap_and_midcap_stock_selection | small caps]] are expensive and buying when they are relatively cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:20">[04:42:20]</a>.
*   **Selling:**
    *   When relative valuation crosses 1.1: sell 10,000 rupees worth of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:20">[04:49:20]</a>.
    *   When relative valuation crosses 1.15: sell an *additional* 10,000 rupees (total 20,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:20">[04:57:20]</a>.
    *   When relative valuation crosses 1.2: redeem a total of 30,000 rupees of [[characteristics_of_microcap_investing | small cap]] units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:20">[05:03:20]</a>.
*   **Buying (over and above the regular 10,000 rupee monthly investment in Nifty Small Cap 250 Index):**
    *   When relative valuation goes below 0.9: invest an *additional* 10,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:20">[05:10:20]</a>.
    *   When relative valuation goes below 0.85: put in an *additional* 20,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:20">[05:14:20]</a>.
    *   When relative valuation goes below 0.8: invest an *additional* 30,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:20">[05:20:20]</a>.

This strategy determines both the action (buy/sell) and the quantum of the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:20">[05:46:20]</a>. This approach delivered an impressive 16.3% annual return, a significant jump from the individual index CAGRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:20">[06:01:20]</a>.

### Scenario 5: Long-Short Opportunity (Redeeming Small Caps to Invest in Large Caps)

If [[small_cap_and_micro_cap_strategies | small caps]] are relatively expensive, it often means large caps are relatively cheap at the same points in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:20">[07:01:20]</a>. This opens a long-short opportunity, allowing investors to buy units in a Nifty 50 Index Fund when redeeming units from a Small Cap 250 Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:20">[07:13:20]</a>. This relative valuation-driven approach provides a respectable return of 16% over a 15-year period and helps accumulate a larger portfolio corpus by generally remaining invested in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:20">[07:28:20]</a>.

## Additional Considerations

*   **Taxes**: While capital gains will incur taxes, a larger portion will likely be long-term. The difference between Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) and Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) may be small (e.g., 5%), so it might not be a major concern for some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:20">[06:37:20]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: If additional capital is not readily available for the increased investment amounts (e.g., 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 rupees), there might be some slippages in strategy execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:20">[06:48:20]</a>.

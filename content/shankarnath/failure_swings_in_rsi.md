The [[Relative Strength Index introduction and history | Relative Strength Index (RSI)]] is a momentum oscillator that measures the velocity and magnitude of price movements, providing signals when a stock is overbought or oversold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. While the standard procedure is to consider selling when RSI goes above 70 (overbought) and buying when it goes below 30 (oversold), stocks can sometimes continue their trend even after entering these zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. To address this, J. Welles Wilder Jr., who introduced the RSI, developed the concept of "failure swings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

Failure swings are a strategy tweak to improve the probability of capturing significant price movements by waiting for the RSI to complete its cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

## Selling Strategy (Bearish Failure Swing)
Instead of selling a stock immediately when its RSI enters the overbought zone (above 70), an investor should wait until the RSI cuts the 70 mark from the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

> "Instead of selling a stock when it enters the overboard Zone one should rather wait and exit only when the RSI cuts the 70 mark from the top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>

### Example: Bajaj Auto Limited
On April 6th, Bajaj Auto Limited's stock price crossed its 70 RSI mark, which would typically signal an exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. However, the price continued to increase, and the stock only breached the 70 RSI mark from above in mid-May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. By waiting for this "failure swing" signal, an investor would have gained an additional 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## Buying Strategy (Bullish Failure Swing)
Similarly, an investor should not buy a stock as soon as its RSI enters the oversold zone (below 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Instead, it is advisable to wait for the RSI to breach the 30 mark from below before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

### Example: Dalmia Bharat Limited
In July, Dalmia Bharat Limited's stock price continued to fall by an additional 6% even after its RSI peered below the 30 mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. A buy signal based on failure swings would have occurred when the RSI breached the 30 mark from the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

## Early Career and Progression

Ashish Kacholia completed his engineering and pursued an MBA from JB IMS in Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. His career commenced in 1993 at Prime Securities, a Mumbai-based brokerage, where he started on the trading desk and quickly rose to Head of Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>. He later gained institutional broking experience at Eaglewise before venturing out on his own in 1995 to establish Lucky Investment Managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:96">[01:10:96]</a>. This firm managed portfolios for high-net-worth individuals, and it was during this time that Kacholia began his own investment journey, demonstrating a talent for identifying scalable businesses with significant growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:99">[01:21:99]</a>.

In 1999, he co-founded Hungama Digital Media Entertainment, venturing into the entertainment technology space alongside Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Neeraj Roy, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:49">[01:34:49]</a>. A pivotal moment occurred in 2003 when he shifted his full attention to stock market investments, carving out a unique niche in midcap and small cap stocks, an area often overlooked by other investors at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.

Ashish Kacholia maintains a low profile, avoiding interviews, tweets, podcasts, and public appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:34">[01:58:34]</a>.

## [[Investment philosophy and strategy | Investment Philosophy and Strategy]]

Kacholia's [[investment philosophy and strategy | investment philosophy and strategy]] is characterized by several key principles:

### Core Principles
His investment approach is described as methodical, data-driven, and rooted in fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:98">[02:22:98]</a>. He emphasizes finding companies that possess a "moat" and are not easily replaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>. This means identifying businesses with unique operations, competitive advantages, or non-replaceable setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>.

### "Demonstration Effect"
A significant characteristic Mr. Kacholia seeks is what he terms the "demonstration effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:34">[04:57:34]</a>. This concept applies to products or systems, such as software, that can be installed in multiple places with multiple clients, leading to replicability and economies of scale through maintenance and upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:83">[05:01:83]</a>. Examples include his investments in Majesco Limited, which yielded a large dividend in 2020, and Fable Fintech, driven by the fact that nine out of India's ten largest private banks use its money transfer software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:09">[05:17:09]</a>.

### [[Investment strategies of Mohnish Pabrai | Value Investing Inspiration]]
Kacholia's [[investment philosophy and strategy | investing strategy]] also adheres to or borrows inspiration from Warren Buffett, focusing on undervalued businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:75">[05:51:75]</a>. Numerous companies in his portfolio, such as E2E Networks, SG Finserve, XPro, Beta Drugs, Phenotex Chemicals, Phase 3, and Safari Industries, have become multi-baggers for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:38">[05:58:38]</a>.

### Investing in Simple Businesses
He prefers to invest in "simple businesses"â€”companies that are highly focused and excel in just one or two areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:90">[06:13:90]</a>. These are often found within the small and midcap space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:36">[06:22:36]</a>.

### Focus on Small and Micro Caps
Despite his success, Kacholia is heavily invested in the small and micro cap space. All 38 companies in his disclosed portfolio (where he holds more than 1%) have a market cap of less than 12,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:26">[06:30:26]</a>. Some are even listed on the SME exchange, including Beta Drugs, Inframe Appliances, Amtron, Knowledge Marine, Vasa, and Denticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:99">[06:40:99]</a>.

### High-Quality Management
A critical aspect of his strategy is the insistence on high-quality management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:08">[07:11:08]</a>. He prioritizes leaders with a proven track record of integrity, performance, and execution capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:34">[07:16:34]</a>.

### Holding Period Flexibility
His average holding period for companies is about 2.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:07">[07:31:07]</a>. While he aims for long-term investments, he is not hesitant to exit companies within a year if they are not moving in the right direction or if the execution does not meet his thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:41">[07:51:41]</a>. This flexibility is a hallmark of his [[investing patterns and strategies | investing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:05">[08:01:05]</a>.

### Growth Focus (Sales and EPS)
Kacholia's portfolio shows a clear preference for companies achieving consistent growth, with sales and profits growing by at least 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:07">[10:56:07]</a>. Half of his portfolio companies grow their EPS annually by at least 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:08">[11:08:08]</a>. This focus on strong earnings per share (EPS) growth is crucial, as a company's stock price often aligns with changes in its EPS over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:03">[11:16:03]</a>.

### Diversification
Unlike concentration-heavy investors, he prefers to diversify investments across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:09">[16:26:09]</a>. This is particularly important in small and micro caps, which tend to be more volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:02">[16:34:02]</a>.

## [[Analyzing Ashish Kacholias current stock portfolio | Ashish Kacholia's Current Portfolio Design]]

As of September 2024, Ashish Kacholia's disclosed portfolio consists of 38 companies where he holds more than 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:07">[09:39:07]</a>. He is likely invested in many more unlisted companies and startups, possibly totaling 80 to 100 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:04">[09:47:04]</a>.

*   **Market Cap**: All 38 disclosed companies are micro caps, with an average market cap of around 2,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.
*   **Sector Preferences**: While seemingly dispersed, he shows a preference for chemical businesses, material companies, small tech players, and manufacturing and infrastructure companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:07">[10:09:07]</a>.
*   **Exclusion of BFSI**: Notably, there are very few financial institutions in his portfolio; only one, SG Finser (focused on supply chain financing), is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:04">[10:18:04]</a>. His historical data for the past decade also shows no BFSI companies, suggesting it's outside his "circle of competence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:07">[10:27:07]</a>.
*   **Valuation vs. Growth**: His companies are not typically considered "cheap" by classical value investors when examining P/E or price-to-book ratios, with a majority having a P/E multiple of 50 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:07">[10:48:07]</a>. However, he compensates for this with strong sales growth, averaging at least 20% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the short and long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:07">[10:56:07]</a>.

## Performance of "Cloning" Ashish Kacholia's Trades

A hypothetical analysis of cloning Kacholia's trades over the last three years (October 2021 to November 2024) suggests that an investment of 10,000 rupees in each of 69 stocks (entering when he did and exiting when he did or holding until November 15) would have yielded an annualized return of 25.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:05">[12:35:05]</a>.

It is important to note that this is an estimation with several assumptions, and the real value lies in the [[lessons and insights from Ashish Kacholias investment approach | lessons learned]] rather than precise numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. Even a successful investor like Kacholia makes mistakes; one in four companies in the analyzed list were either exited at a loss or are still held at an unrealized loss, despite the strong performance of small and micro caps since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:09">[14:02:09]</a>.

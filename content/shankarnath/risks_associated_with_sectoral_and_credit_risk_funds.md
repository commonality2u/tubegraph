Investing in specific types of mutual funds, such as sectoral and credit risk funds, carries distinct risks that investors should be aware of. While these funds might appear appealing, they can potentially lead to less-than-optimal outcomes for investors.

## Sectoral Funds

A sectoral fund invests exclusively in businesses within a specific industry or sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Examples include healthcare funds (covering pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, diagnostic centers, medical device manufacturers, and health insurance companies), banking funds, technology funds, and infrastructure funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Reasons to Avoid Sectoral Funds

Several factors make sectoral funds a less advisable investment for many:

*   **High Volatility**
    Sectoral funds are extremely volatile, exhibiting larger spikes and deeper troughs compared to more diversified equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This heightened fluctuation can lead to significant swings in investment value.
*   **High Expense Ratio**
    These schemes typically charge a high expense ratio, which can exceed two percent even for direct plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This higher fee eats into potential returns.
*   **Cyclical Performance**
    Many investors are drawn to these funds based on their historical returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, this is generally an unprofitable practice due to the inherent cyclicity of these sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. A sector performing well historically might not continue to do so, leading to potential losses for new investors.

Unless there is a compelling reason, it is generally advisable to avoid [[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | sectoral]] or theme-based funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Credit Risk Funds

A credit risk fund is mandated to lend at least 65 percent of its assets to instruments rated below AAA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. These instruments include securities like debentures and Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) from various companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Risks Associated with Credit Risk Funds

While these borrowing companies may offer a higher rate of interest to compensate for their lower credit rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, this does not mitigate the fundamental risks:

*   **Higher Risk of Principal Jeopardy**
    Credit risk funds inherently take on a higher level of risk, which can potentially jeopardize both the investor's interest and principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Inadequate Return Compensation**
    The risk undertaken by these funds often does not adequately compensate investors in terms of the returns offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. In fact, their returns have barely kept pace with categories like ultra-short duration and money market funds, which carry significantly less risk and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

It is advisable to avoid credit risk funds. Instead, focus on [[debt_mutual_funds_and_safety_considerations | debt funds]] that offer moderate, predictable gains with a fair degree of capital preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Related Risk: Debt Mutual Funds with Low AUM

Beyond specific credit risk funds, a general practice for [[risk_management_in_investing | risk management]] in [[debt_mutual_funds_and_safety_considerations | debt mutual funds]] is to avoid those with a very low Asset Under Management (AUM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

*   **Restricted Diversification**
    When funds lack sufficient capital, they are significantly restricted in what and how much they can purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This severely hampers the diversification requirement crucial for [[debt_mutual_funds_and_safety_considerations | debt funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Increased Risk per Security**
    For example, a fund with an AUM of 22 crores might hold only two securities, which is far fewer than other schemes in the same category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. A low count of securities makes these funds risky, as a single default can seriously dent the Net Asset Value (NAV) and the scheme's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

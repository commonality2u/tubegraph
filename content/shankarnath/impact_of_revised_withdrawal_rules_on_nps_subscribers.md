The [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | National Pension System]] (NPS) has undergone numerous adjustments and changes over the past few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The pace of change has been significant, leading to updated rules and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. These revisions particularly impact withdrawal options for subscribers.

## Systematic Lumpsum Withdrawal (SLW) Introduction

Previously, [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | NPS]] subscribers, upon retiring, could withdraw up to 60% of their accumulated funds as a tax-free lump sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The remaining 40% had to be allocated to an [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. While the 40% [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] allocation remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, subscribers now have more flexibility with the 60% portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Subscribers can now choose to withdraw the 60% part either as a lump sum or on a periodic basis once they reach 60 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This new facility is formally known as [[systematic_withdrawal_plan_and_rebalancing | Systematic Lumpsum Withdrawal]] (SLW) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Through SLW, retirement payments can be received in a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annual mode until the age of 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This resembles the [[systematic_withdrawal_plan_and_rebalancing | systematic withdrawal plan]] offered by mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

A key distinction is that no tax is currently expected to be paid on SLW receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. According to Section 10(12A) of the Income Tax Act, lump sum withdrawals from [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | NPS]] up to 60% are exempt from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, and the same rule is ideally expected to apply to SLW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Tax Implications
> It is advisable to consult a tax advisor regarding the tax implications of SLW receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Further details on SLW activation, payment timelines, modification/cancellation options, and procedures in case of subscriber expiry are explained in an FAQ document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

The introduction of the [[systematic_withdrawal_plan_and_rebalancing | SLW]] facility is a significant relief for [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | NPS]] subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Many would otherwise be unsure how to manage a large 60% lump sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Now, they can withdraw smaller amounts periodically for expenses, avoid taxes on these withdrawals, and allow the remaining corpus to continue growing within the [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | NPS]] environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Enhanced Withdrawal and Payment Processes

Several other recent changes have also improved the withdrawal and payment experience for [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | NPS]] subscribers:

### Mandatory Penny Drop Verification
In October of the previous year, the PFRDA introduced mandatory penny drop verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This account verification method involves depositing a small amount (e.g., one or two rupees) into the subscriber's bank account for authentication before crediting funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This process helps resolve issues like name mismatches, invalid/inactive account numbers, or incorrect IFSC codes, ensuring funds are credited without delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. As this verification is mandatory for withdrawals, subscribers are advised to complete it as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This penny drop process applies to [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | NPS]], Atal Pension Yojana, and [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | NPS]] Lite, and also for any modifications to bank account details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Simplified Annuity Documents and Faster Settlement
Effective April 1, 2023, the PFRDA mandated the upload of certain documents to simplify and speed up a subscriber's [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] payments after exiting the [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | National Pension System]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Required documents include the [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | NPS]] exit/withdrawal form, proof of identity, proof of address, bank account copy, and PRAN card copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Earlier, in 2022, the PFRDA announced that [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | NPS]] subscribers would not need a separate proposal form for selecting an [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. The exit form submitted by the subscriber now doubles as the [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] proposal form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This reduction in paperwork significantly decreases the time it takes for life insurance companies to issue [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] policies, leading to a better service experience for the subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

Furthermore, in August 2022, the PFRDA announced a reduction in settlement time, meaning faster withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. [[Recent changes in the National Pension System | NPS]] intermediaries (CRAs, Pension Funds, Custodians) have enhanced their IT capabilities to process withdrawal requests in a T+2 working day settlement cycle, a significant improvement from the earlier T+4 basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. If a withdrawal request is authorized by 11:00 a.m., it will now be settled on a T+2 working day basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This covers a wide range of withdrawal requests, including superannuation, premature exit, death, [[role_of_annuity_options_in_nps_investment_strategy | annuity]] withdrawals, Tier 2 withdrawals, partial withdrawals, one-way switches, and [[systematic_withdrawal_plan_and_rebalancing | rebalancing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

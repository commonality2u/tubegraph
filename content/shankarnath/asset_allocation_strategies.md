[[introduction_to_asset_allocation | Asset allocation]] is a fundamental aspect of managing investments, yet many investors often overlook it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. While investors may choose specific schemes like PPFAS Flexi Cap, Quant Small Cap, or index funds, a clear [[asset_allocation_strategy | strategy]] outlining how these funds fit into a portfolio and how their selection can improve risk-adjusted returns is frequently absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Importance of Diversification

It makes perfect sense to diversify one's [[portfolio_asset_allocation_with_two_funds | portfolio]] across different asset classes, industries, and geographical regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. A diversified portfolio, for example, with 60% in equities and portions in debt and gold, can outperform a 100% equity portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions

For many mutual fund investors, [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] is narrowly perceived as solely a division between large caps, midcaps, small caps, and international equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, a more comprehensive understanding reveals the importance of using [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | strategies]] based on factors like momentum, value, and quality, in addition to market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. These advanced [[strategic_asset_allocation_factors | strategies]] can enhance portfolio returns while simultaneously reducing risk and downside exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Risk Management and Portfolio Building

Implementing [[dynamic_and_tactical_asset_allocation_strategies | risk management strategies]] is crucial to avoid excessive risk and unnecessary losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. A portfolio can be built using diversified assets, including equity, gold, bonds, and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## The Role of Rebalancing

Rebalancing is a critical step in [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | portfolio management]] that involves periodically adjusting the [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] by buying and selling assets to maintain a desired mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. For instance, a 50/50 debt and equity portfolio that is not rebalanced could shift to a 67/33 mix over ten years due to different growth rates, altering its risk profile significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

### Benefits of Rebalancing
Rebalancing is essential because it:
*   Reduces risk in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   Allows investors to capture gains and control losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   Comes with [[benefits_of_asset_allocation_in_diversifying_investments | diversification benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   Improves the portfolio's risk-adjusted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

Rebalancing does not need to be done monthly; one or two reviews per year are generally sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. It can be done before the end of a financial year (February or March) or upon receiving an annual bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

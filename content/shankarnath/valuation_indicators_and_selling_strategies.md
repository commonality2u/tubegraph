When equity markets reach all-time highs, many investors, especially "normal everyday investors," tend to make common mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These include selling mutual fund units for direct stock investments, dabbling in Futures and Options, and chasing performance without considering [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. A sense of FOMO often sets in, leading to a neglect of risk management, reduced diversification, investing in penny stocks, and excessive confidence in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Even the benchmark for [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation metrics]], such as the Nifty long-term P/E ratio, may seem to automatically increase in investors' minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The standard long-term Nifty P/E ratio is 21, but during market highs, investors might normalize higher P/E values like 24 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Operating in All-Time High Markets

There are generally two lines of thought for operating in high markets:
*   **Buy and Hold**: This approach, adopted by many index fund buyers, involves continuous investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Traders**: For traders, an "in and out" strategy is a way of life, focused on market entry and exit timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

For investors in the middle, who are not strictly Buy and Hold or day traders, considering booking profits is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This strategy not only helps maximize gains but also aids in reducing portfolio risk and preserving capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Profit Booking Strategies

### 1. Avoiding "All or Nothing"

While there might be an urge to sell all equity holdings and sit on cash when markets are at an all-time high, this is generally a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. A sizable portion of wealth creation comes from equity allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. After a market drop, the stock market tends to rise again, but the timing of this bounce back is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

It is crucial to:
*   **Stick to a Minimum Equity Allocation**: Maintain a predetermined comfort level, such as 50%, 60%, or 70% of your portfolio in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Tactical Churning**: Only churn the "opportunity part" of your equity portfolio for tactical calls. For example, if your comfort zone is 50-70%, you can use the 20% difference tactically based on [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Sector-Specific Exits**: Moving out of a specific sector is acceptable if it's overvalued or facing issues (e.g., policy changes, pandemics, drop in demand, regulations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

> Never go for an "All or Nothing" strategy when it comes to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### 2. Beyond Percentage-Based Profit Booking

An older concept, the "free shares" technique, suggests selling half your shares if an investment has doubled in value, effectively recuperating capital and making the remaining shares "free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. However, this method is generally not recommended for long-term investors, as many stocks can double multiple times (e.g., Titan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Percentage appreciation-based strategies might be more suitable for short-term traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### 3. Using [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | Valuation Indicators]] for Sell Decisions

The smarter approach for long-term investors is to pick sell candidates based on [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | valuation indicators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>:
*   **Key Ratios**: Use the P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and other [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation metrics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Comparing these ratios across peers (e.g., cement companies with P/E ranging from 25 to 60) provides a logical idea of under- and overvaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Combined Factors**: Combine [[stock_picking_triggers_using_relative_valuation | valuation metrics]] with other factors:
    *   Earnings growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>
    *   Sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
    *   Future estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
    *   Price-based technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>

**Example**: If you bought Apollo Tyres at a P/E of 28.1 and it's now trading at 16.6, despite a significant price increase, its [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuation]] has become more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Understanding [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuations]] is more important than just percentage price rises, to avoid selling potential multi-baggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### 4. Selling Low Conviction Bets

At market highs, prioritize selling investments where you have low conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **High Conviction Bets**: These are investments where you've done extensive research, analysis, and your investment thesis still holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Low Conviction Bets**: These include investments where you haven't put in much effort to understand the business, have simply ridden the bull market wave, or were acquired based on tips or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
Use market highs as an opportunity to sell these low conviction ideas and retain instruments where you have better knowledge and conviction in their business and fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### 5. Cleaning Up Weaker/Loss-Making Stocks

An all-time high market presents a prime opportunity to divest from weaker stocks and even loss-making positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Many long-term portfolios accumulate a "long tail" of underperforming stocks over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. As a rising tide lifts all boats, even these weaker stocks (especially in mid-cap and small-cap segments) may have risen in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

Use this moment to push out fundamentally weak companies or those whose earning cycle has started to trend downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Even when booking losses, tax loss harvesting rules can allow you to set off losses against capital gains, helping save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### 6. Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)

Just as [[diy_sip_strategies_and_market_valuation | Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs)]] reduce timing risk when entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, using a systematic route for exits is advisable, especially without a specific [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuation]] target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. A Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) allows an investor to sell holdings in a phased manner and in equal lots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Unlike SIPs, SWPs require defining an exit period, ideally not too long when markets are at an all-time high; a six-month tenure is often suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. For example, to reduce equity allocation from 80% to 65% (a 15 lakh sale), a 6-month SWP would involve withdrawing 2.5 lakhs per month from equity funds into a bank account or a debt/arbitrage fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Be ready to cancel the SWP if there's a sudden market fall to avoid selling at lower [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

> Don't panic and never get rid of all your positions in one go, assuming it will maximize profit booking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### 7. Having a Redeployment Plan

Before selling any stock or mutual fund holdings, always have a redeployment plan for the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Suggested avenues for redeployment include:
*   **Rebalancing**: Adjusting your portfolio to align with your original asset allocation plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Financial Goals**: Using the funds for upcoming financial goals like a car down payment or home renovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Tactical Redeployment**: Placing money into a fixed deposit, arbitrage fund, or short-term debt mutual fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Wish List Companies**: Reinvesting into a wish list of companies you've always wanted to own, provided they are not excessively valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### 8. Rebalancing for Portfolio Health

Rebalancing is the fine-tuning of an investment portfolio to keep it aligned with the original plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. When some investments (like equity during a high market) grow faster, they alter the asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Rebalancing involves selling equities when markets are high and using that cash to invest in non-equity instruments, such as debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

This process ensures profit booking and improves the portfolio's shape, aligning return expectations with risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Essentially, it makes you divest from relatively overvalued assets (equities) and invest in undervalued ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. While it might seem illogical to sell winners and invest in "losers," studies show that rebalancing improves a long-term investor's risk-adjusted returns by leveraging market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

By combining these strategies, investors can intelligently navigate all-time high equity markets and make planned, smart exit decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

Investing in real estate, particularly commercial properties, can be made more accessible through [[introduction_to_real_estate_investment_trusts_reits_in_india | Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. While the concept of REITs is relatively new in India, with Embassy Office Parks listing in 2019, followed by Mindspace in 2020 and Brookfield in 2021, these three entities offer a transparent and regulated way to invest in income-producing real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

This article compares Embassy Office Parks, Mindspace Business Parks, and Brookfield India REITs based on key [[investment_factors_and_evaluation_metrics_for_reits | investment factors and evaluation metrics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (FY 2023 Q2)

As of the second quarter of FY 2023, Embassy Office Parks generally showed a lead across most parameters compared to Mindspace and Brookfield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. REIT companies release updated numbers quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

The key [[investment_factors_and_evaluation_metrics_for_reits | factors to examine]] when identifying the right REIT for investment include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>:
1.  Net Asset Value (NAV) per unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>
2.  Occupancy Rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>
3.  Weighted Average Lease Expiry (WALLE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>
4.  Distribution Yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>
5.  Portfolio Quality (Tenants and Geographical Spread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>
6.  Taxation Angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>

### Net Asset Value (NAV) Per Unit and Discount

The NAV per unit represents the market value of a REIT's properties minus its liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This calculation is performed once every six months for REITs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

As of September 30, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>:
*   **Embassy Office Parks**: NAV per unit was ₹400.71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
*   **Mindspace Business Parks**: NAV per unit was ₹370.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
*   **Brookfield**: NAV per unit was ₹337 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Comparing the NAV per unit to the REIT's market value provides an important [[evaluation_metrics_for_real_estate_companies | valuation metric]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Indian REITs typically trade at a discount of 14% to 16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. However, these discounts are not always stable, creating opportunities for investors to buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. For example, Embassy Office Parks' market price has shown significant volatility, often vacillating between a low of ₹309 and a high of ₹467, while its NAV has remained in a tighter range of ₹375 to ₹400 over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

### Occupancy Rate

A higher occupancy rate is desirable for REITs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. The current occupancy rate for these REITs is in the 87% to 89% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, occupancy rates were in the high 80s and even above 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. An acceptable range for occupancy is considered to be 85% to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

### Weighted Average Lease Expiry (WALLE)

WALLE measures the time remaining for a property to go vacant, with a higher WALLE being better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Globally, a WALLE of five years is considered good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. All three companies — Embassy, Mindspace, and Brookfield — have maintained a WALLE of between six to seven years over many quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

### Distribution Yield

The distribution yield represents the returns earned by REIT unit holders as a percentage of the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. REITs typically offer a dividend yield of 5% to 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

Based on trailing 12-month calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>:
*   **Brookfield**: Offers a distribution yield of 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.
*   **Embassy Office Parks**: Offers a distribution yield of 6.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
*   **Mindspace**: Offers a distribution yield of 5.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

It's important to be careful when reviewing distribution yields disclosed by REITs, as they might calculate it based on the issue price rather than the current market price, which can inflate the reported yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Quality

Portfolio quality consists of two main variables: tenants and geographical spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

#### Tenants
A good REIT should not be overly dependent on a few clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. For example, Brookfield has about 72 clients, but Accenture, TCS, and Cognizant together account for over 41% of its leased area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. This figure was previously higher at 49% a year prior, indicating Brookfield's efforts to diversify its tenant base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

#### Geographical Spread
Most REITs tend to have a locational preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.
*   **Embassy**: 74% of its gross asset value comes from Bangalore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.
*   **Mindspace**: Has 37% in Mumbai and 37% in Hyderabad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.
*   **Brookfield**: 67% of its asset value is from the NCR region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

While concentrating properties in a few locations can improve economics, it introduces city-specific risks such as lockdowns, floods, and political issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. A more spread-out and diverse geographical presence is generally better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

### Taxation

The [[tax_treatment_and_returns_on_reit_investments | taxation of REITs]] in India can be complex, with different structures for each REIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. REITs receive some tax exemptions on rental income and leasing interest, which helps reduce tax liability and generate higher investor income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

Investors typically earn returns from REITs through four channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>:
1.  **Interest Income**: Taxable at the investor's income tax slab rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Amortization of SPV Debt**: Non-taxable for the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
3.  **Capital Gains**: Short-term capital gains (held less than one year) are taxed at 15%, while long-term capital gains are taxed at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
4.  **Dividends**: Whether dividends are taxable depends on whether the REIT's Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) opted for a lower tax regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. If the SPV took tax concessions, the dividend becomes taxable for the investor; otherwise, it remains tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. This means dividend tax treatment can differ between REITs, and investors should consult the investor presentations for specific information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

## Investing in REITs

Units in REITs can be bought or sold in the secondary market through any trading platform, similar to how shares are bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. With the buying quantity now reduced to just one unit, individuals can start investing in real estate via REITs for as little as ₹300 to ₹350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

REITs can offer value to a portfolio as an asset diversifier and stability builder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. Given that the asset class is relatively new in India and laws are still maturing, it is advisable to limit exposure to not more than 10% of a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. Expected returns from REITs are typically 5% to 6% in post-tax dividends and 4% to 5% in capital appreciation, assuming thorough due diligence on the major factors discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.

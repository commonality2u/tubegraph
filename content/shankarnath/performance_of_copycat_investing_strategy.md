This article reviews and assesses the updated [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | shameless cloning]] investment methodology, building upon the original video that garnered significant viewership and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The motivation for this review stemmed from market fluctuations affecting small and micro-cap investors, including prominent figures like Ashish Kachia, whose portfolios saw corrections of 20-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The goal was to refine the "copycat" approach and evaluate its current [[performance_analysis_of_losers_portfolio | performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Original Shameless Cloning Strategy

The initial [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | shameless cloning]] strategy involved identifying approximately 10 market investors and focusing on companies where they held at least 1% of outstanding shares as of December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The top 3-5 stocks from each investor were selected, resulting in a list of about 57 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Entry and exit points were simulated at the end of each quarter, which was noted as a complex and difficult to execute aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Despite these complexities and shortcomings, the original strategy delivered an annualized return of 41.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, this measurement was taken during a full-flow bull market, and the strategy was considered complicated to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Revised Copycat Investing Strategy

Two major changes were introduced to create a revised copycat [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Change 1: Overhaul of the Method - Real-time Data

The first significant change was moving from quarter-end disclosures to using real-time data for tracking investor activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Previously, there was a delay of one to two months in processing information about major investors' trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The revised approach utilizes buying information reported to the exchange on the same day or the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Specific large-volume transaction disclosures tracked include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>:
*   **Bulk Deal:** An investor buys or sells at least 0.5% of a company's total shares in a single trading session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Block Deal:** A pre-arranged trade involving at least 5 lakh shares or ₹10 crores in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Insider Trading:** Buying or selling shares based on non-public, price-sensitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **SAST Disclosure Rules:** Applicable when someone acquires 5% or more in a listed company, or crosses 25% (triggering an open offer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

This shift to almost real-time transactions structurally improves the [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | cloning strategy]] and addresses previous timing concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Change 2: Fixed Holding Period for Exit

Instead of exiting at varied points in time, the revised strategy adopts a "lazier" approach: buying a stock when a market investor buys it, but then selling after a fixed period, such as a couple of months or years, without waiting for the original investor to sell their shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This proactive selling simplifies the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Addressing Brokerage Fees

Frequent buying and selling can lead to high brokerage fees, reducing profits and discouraging tactical moves like stop-loss or portfolio rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Stocks Kart, a brokerage platform, offers a "smart trader plan" at a fixed subscription of ₹99 per month for unlimited trades, or ₹699 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. They also provide features like order slicing, advanced charting, one-click order placement, real-time insights, and in-depth stock research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Implementation of Revised Strategy

The implementation involved two parts:

### Part 1: Data Extraction and Cleaning
1.  **Identifying Investors:** A list of well-known investors was chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Extracting Buy Transactions:** Buy transactions were extracted from April 1, 2021, to March 28, 2025, covering four years of bulk deals, block deals, insider trades, and SAST transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
3.  **Filtering Low-Value Transactions:** Only buy transactions of at least ₹1 crore and upwards were kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This resulted in 93 transactions from 17 different investors across 80 different stocks, forming a broad portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Part 2: Performance Analysis

The second part focused on examining gains and losses from the 93 transactions across different holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Short-term analysis:** 3-month and 6-month holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Long-term evaluation:** 1-year and 2-year holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Performance Results of the Revised Strategy

The revised [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | shameless cloning]] portfolio showed consistent outperformance against the Nifty Small Cap 250 index.

*   **3-Month Holding Period:**
    *   Copycat Portfolio: 14.5% absolute return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   Nifty Small Cap 250 Index: 5.3% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Difference: 9% outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   **6-Month Holding Period:**
    *   Copycat Portfolio: Over 21% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   Nifty Small Cap 250 Index: 12% returns on a rolling basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

*   **1-Year Holding Period:**
    *   The performance gap narrowed to just 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

*   **2-Year Holding Period:**
    *   The difference widened to an impressive 15%, even after removing outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    *   However, this period largely covered bull runs (2021-2023 and 2022-2024), which may have inflated the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Long-Term Holding Scenario

A simulation was run where all 93 stocks were bought at disclosure and held until March 28, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>:
*   Copycat Portfolio: 24.7% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   Nifty Small Cap 250 Index: 17% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   This indicates a consistent 5-7% outperformance over the long term, though this is an observation, not a guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Success Rate

Even seasoned investors make mistakes; the success rate from this study was barely over 50%, with a third of their picks ending in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Conclusion

> [!info] Summary of Revised Strategy Advantages
> The modified [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | shameless cloning]] approach is considered significantly better than the previous version due to:
> 1.  **Real-time Data:** Utilizes almost real-time transaction data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
> 2.  **No 1% Shareholding Restriction:** Allows for fresh investments or top-ups, unlike the previous 1% shareholding rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
> 3.  **Easier Cash Flow Management:** Fixed holding periods simplify cash flow, which was erratic previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
> 4.  **Realistic Expectations:** Examining rolling returns across periods sets more realistic expectations, closer to 5-7% outperformance over the benchmark index, rather than the earlier 41.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

This method can be applied not only to individual investors but also to FII data, mutual funds, and PMS companies to build custom copycat models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The research analyst license application for Smallcase has been filed, with hopes of a license soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

The start of a financial year, particularly the month of April, is an opportune time to prepare oneself for the oncoming financial year, including reviewing one's [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies|investment portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. A disciplined review can help organize finances better and contribute to achieving financial goals faster and with less stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Importance of Regular Review
While an [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies|investment portfolio]] review can be done in months like February and March, it's crucial to perform it regularly and in a disciplined manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This review is essential because various internal and external factors can change over the year, impacting financial goals and [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy|strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Key Areas for Portfolio Review

Three specific areas require particular attention when reviewing an [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies|investment portfolio]]:

### 1. Asset Allocation
[[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management|Asset allocation]] involves smartly dividing a portfolio across different assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The dual goals of [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management|asset allocation]] are to:
*   Improve returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   Simultaneously reduce the portfolio's volatility or [[risk_management_in_investing|risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

[[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management|Asset allocation]] is a fundamental aspect that cannot be avoided in [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management|portfolio management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### 2. Performance Review
This step focuses on identifying underperforming investments and instruments that have a better chance of performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. A thorough performance review requires understanding:
*   Returns of individual stocks or mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   Consistency of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   Fund manager's [[investment_philosophy and strategy|investing style]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   Valuation, balance sheet strength, and growth estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

For thematic funds or cyclical stocks, it is crucial to understand where the particular stock or sector stands in its business cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Holding or buying more of an instrument when its cycle is at its peak can lead to losses and reduce overall portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### 3. Rebalancing
Rebalancing means bringing your portfolio back to its original [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management|asset allocation]] targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This is achieved by selling assets that have overperformed and buying some of the underperforming ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   This adjustment not only reduces variability in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Studies indicate that rebalancing can improve portfolio returns by up to one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Implementation Considerations
When implementing these steps, it's important to pay attention to finer details, including:
*   Which fund, ETF, or stock to buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   The tax payable on capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   Tax loss harvesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   Tolerance levels and exit loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Practical Application
> While these three steps (asset allocation, performance review, and rebalancing) might seem daunting initially, they become easier with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Aligning with Broader Financial Picture

### Reviewing Financial Goals
The beginning of a financial year is an appropriate time to review one's financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This process starts with a clear understanding of those goals, which should ideally be listed in a document for periodic review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   Track current progress against these goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Consider internal factors that may have changed, such as income, new expenses, or new life goals (e.g., marriage, a baby) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Account for external factors like changes in tax laws, affecting take-home salary, or inflation impacting planned purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
Understanding your goals, your current standing, and necessary adjustments is key to being prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Optimizing Incremental Income
When annual increments are received, it's advisable to think scientifically about increasing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Instead of simply increasing monthly investments proportionally to the income hike, consider dedicating a larger portion of the incremental income to investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Apportioning a higher amount early in one's investing career can significantly boost wealth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Financial Literacy
Becoming more financially literate is a critical focus area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Financial literacy encompasses a basic understanding of six key financial matters:
1.  **Budgeting money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
2.  **Setting financial goals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
3.  **Saving money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
4.  **Basics of debt**, including loans, credit cards, and credit scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
5.  **Taxes**, how they work, and how to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
6.  **How investing works**, focusing on basic instruments like fixed deposits, NPS, mutual funds, and sovereign gold bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

Cultivating intellectual curiosity and continually learning about financial topics can make these concepts ingrained and habitual over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

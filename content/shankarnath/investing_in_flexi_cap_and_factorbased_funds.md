To achieve ambitious wealth creation goals, such as reaching 10 crores within 15 years, a modified investment strategy focusing on specific fund categories can be employed [0:01:21]. This approach aims for a 15% return percentage, higher than the Nifty50's historical 12% [0:03:37].

The suggested strategy involves splitting monthly investments:
*   **First SIP:** ₹15,000 into a [[comparison_of_multicap_and_flexicap_funds | multicap or flexi cap fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Second SIP:** ₹15,000 into a [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | factor-based fund or ETF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

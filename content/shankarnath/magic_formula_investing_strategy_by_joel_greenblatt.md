The Magic Formula Investing strategy is a formula-driven approach that focuses on buying good companies at favorable prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Developed by Joel Greenblatt and detailed in his book *The Little Book That Beats the Market*, the strategy hinges on the uncomplicated objective of finding cheap and good companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The term "magic" is primarily a marketing term, but the strategy has shown impressive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

This strategy is based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts used to deliver quick results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It's akin to analytical shortcuts like the Rule of 72, which quickly estimates the time needed to double money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Key Metrics

The Magic Formula uses two primary metrics to identify suitable companies:

### 1. Earnings Yield (for "Cheapness")
Earnings yield showcases a company's cheapness from a valuation perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Calculation:** Operating Earnings (EBIT) as a percentage of its Enterprise Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   **Operating Earnings (EBIT):** Can be found in the company's profit and loss statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   **Enterprise Value (EV):** Calculated by taking the company's market capitalization plus its debt minus its cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Interpretation:** A higher earnings yield indicates a cheaper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This metric identifies the investor's return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### 2. Return on Capital (for "Goodness")
Return on Capital (ROC) is used to identify good companies, indicating how efficiently a company uses its resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Calculation:** Operating Earnings (EBIT) divided by the summation of its net fixed assets and net working capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Interpretation:** A higher ROC suggests a more efficiently run company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. High ROC often correlates with superior brand, loyal customer base, excellent products/services, strong sustainable business models, and a wide economic moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

The Magic Formula combines these two characteristics: earnings yield (quantifying cheapness) and return on capital (explaining business efficiency and quality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Nine Steps to Implement

Joel Greenblatt outlines nine rules or steps for implementing the Magic Formula Investing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>:

1.  **Market Capitalization Filter:** Apply the formula only to companies with a market capitalization of at least $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. For the [[implementation_of_magic_formula_in_indian_stock_market | Indian stock market]], this translates to companies with a market cap of 5,000 crores or more, limiting the universe to the top 500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
2.  **Sector Exclusion:** Exclude financial companies and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This exclusion is likely due to their reliance on large amounts of debt for financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
3.  **Geographical Exclusion:** Ignore foreign companies and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. For investors, this means sticking to domestic companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
4.  **Calculate Earnings Yield:** Determine the earnings yield for the remaining universe of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
5.  **Calculate Return on Capital:** Compute the return on capital for the same companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
6.  **Rank and Score Companies:**
    *   Allocate a rank to each company based on its earnings yield (lower rank for higher yield) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   Allocate a rank to each company based on its return on capital (lower rank for higher ROC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   Add these two ranks together to get a total score for each company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Companies with a low total score are better positioned in terms of combined cheapness and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    *   Sort the table based on the total score to get the preferred list of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
7.  **Invest in Top-Ranked Companies:** Invest in approximately 20 to 30 of the highest-ranking companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Greenblatt suggests accumulating these stocks progressively, investing in four to five companies each quarter over a 12-month period to take advantage of fluctuating valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
8.  **Annual Rebalancing:** Rebalance the portfolio once a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   Sell "loser" stocks in the 51st week of purchase to book short-term capital losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   Sell "winner" stocks in the 53rd week from purchase to realize long-term capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   Use the proceeds to repeat the seven steps and acquire a new set of stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
9.  **Persistence:** Persist with this approach for at least five years to derive maximum benefit from the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## [[backtesting_and_performance_of_magic_formula | Backtesting and Performance]]

Joel Greenblatt backtested his Magic Formula between 1988 and 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. In those 16 years, the Magic Portfolio had only one down year and delivered a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 30.8%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's annual return of 12.4% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Studies globally (Brazil, Hong Kong, China, Thailand, Nordic countries, United States) have supported the Magic Formula's ability to deliver superior results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### In India
*   A 2021 paper by research students of Sri Guru Gobind Singh College of Commerce simulated the Magic Formula on [[implementation_of_magic_formula_in_indian_stock_market | Indian stocks]] over an eight-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   On a risk-unadjusted basis, it delivered better returns in 5 out of 8 years, with a CAGR of 13.9% against the BSE Sensex's 9.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   A 30-stock portfolio offered better returns than 10-stock or 50-stock portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   Another backtest by Amit Madha from 2002 to 2020 simulated an equal-weighted portfolio of 25 stocks (4% allocation each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   The Nifty 50 generated a 12.7% return, while the Magic Formula portfolio delivered an astounding 35.4% over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
    *   An investment of 1 lakh rupees in 2002 would have grown to 2.33 crores by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_considerations_in_magic_formula_investing | Challenges and Considerations]]

While powerful, the Magic Formula has nuances to consider:

*   **Cyclical Sectors:** Be cautious of companies in cyclical sectors (e.g., metals and mining) that may register high operating incomes in recent years, artificially boosting their earnings yield and ROC scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. One can use normalized earnings (average over 5-6 years) or omit these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Cash-Rich Companies:** Some top-ranking companies by earnings yield may have a high cash balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Since Enterprise Value (EV) excludes cash in its calculations, this can lead to lopsided numbers and misrepresent the actual return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Beyond the Formula:** Blindly trusting a Magic Formula screener is not advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. It should be backed up with an analysis of the company's business model, financial statements, seasonality, promoters' integrity, growth runway, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## How to Invest Using the Magic Formula

1.  **Do-It-Yourself (DIY):** Follow the nine steps outlined above. This involves manual calculations or using custom filters on platforms like Screener or Ticker Tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

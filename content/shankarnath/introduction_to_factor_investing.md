[[factorbased_investing | Factor investing]] functions similarly to the concept of marginal gains described in "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, where minor adjustments to an index investing approach can yield substantial long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These "small adjustments" can translate into a 5-10% increase in annual returns compared to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## What is a Factor?
A factor is a distinct characteristic or attribute identified to influence the performance and returns of a specific stock or portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For example, if winning cricket matches is considered "returns," then strong fielding efforts, which significantly contribute to winning, would be a "factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Historically, major indices like the Nifty 50, Sensex, Nifty Mid Cap 150, and S&P 500 were primarily based on the market capitalization (size) of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. However, with advancements in computing power, a wider array of factors have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These include:
*   Profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   Sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   Sentiment analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   Human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Cybersecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Social influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

A factor is generally not an isolated characteristic; rather, it often represents a "package of attributes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For instance, the **Value Factor** identifies companies with a market price per share lower than their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Since "value" is not a single accounting metric, it uses multiple variables like:
*   P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   P/B ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   Price to sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   Dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
*   Buyback history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

The exact methodology to define factors like momentum, quality, or value can differ among analysts and fund houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Smart Beta Funds
Because of the complexity of [[factorbased_investing | factor investing]], funds that apply these strategies are marketed as "smart beta funds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. These funds offer several advantages:
*   Passive style of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Transparent, rules-based methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   Broadly diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   Lower expense ratios compared to active funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>

While India's smart beta fund market is still small (AUM over 6000 crores), the global [[factorbased_investing | factor investing]] market is valued at $1.3 trillion, suggesting that smart beta funds are likely to become a primary investment vehicle for millions of mutual fund investors in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Overview of Common Factors in Investing
Four commonly used factors are: Value, Momentum, Quality, and Low Volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Value Factor
The **Value Factor** is based on the premise that companies with low valuations tend to generate higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A classic definition identifies value companies as the top 30% of stocks with the highest Book Value to Market Cap ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Indian Indices:**
    *   **S&P BSE Value Index:** Uses a combination of Book Value, Price Earnings, and Sales to derive a value score, applied to the BSE Large Mid Cap Index to create a 30-stock value-based index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   **Nifty 50 Value 20 Fund:** Assigns weights and ranks companies based on Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), P/E ratio, Price to Book ratio, and Dividend Yield, aiming for high ROCE, low P/E, low P/B, and high dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Performance:** The Value 20 index has "handsomely outperformed" the Nifty 50 TRI over five years with lower volatility, especially in 2020 and 2021 when it made "massive gains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Momentum Factor
The **Momentum Factor** operates on the principle that stocks performing well relative to their peers in the past will continue to perform well in the future, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This is time-bound, requiring continuous adjustments (moving in and out of stocks) over three, four, or six-month periods to capture upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Indian Market Funds:**
    *   Nifty 200 Momentum 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>
    *   Nifty Mid Cap 150 Momentum 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
*   **Performance:** Over a five-year period, this strategy has performed slightly better than the market cap-weighted Nifty 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. It excels when stock markets are rising but shows weakness during bear markets, as seen in 2018 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Quality Factor
The **Quality Factor** focuses on companies that are highly profitable, possess a strong balance sheet, and have little to no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. However, there is a lack of consensus on its exact definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **S&P BSE Quality Index Metrics:**
    *   **Return on Equity (ROE):** Higher ROE is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   **Balance Sheet Accruals Ratio:** Based on net operating assets; a lower number is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   **Financial Leverage Ratio:** Calculated by dividing book value by total debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Indian Indices:** Nifty offers various quality index options for the Mid Cap 150, Nifty 100, and Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Performance:** The Nifty 200 Quality 30 index shows significant variations in returns compared to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Low Volatility Factor
Contrary to the belief that higher risk leads to greater returns, many studies indicate that a low-risk portfolio can outperform a high-risk one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This approach gained popularity after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis as investors sought defensive, less volatile stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Volatility is typically measured as the standard deviation of a stock's daily price returns over about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Methodology:** There are Nifty and S&P methodologies for this factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Performance:** The low volatility index consistently keeps volatility lower than the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. While it hasn't always matched Nifty 50 returns year-on-year, its returns are remarkably close, effectively offering Nifty 50-like returns with less risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Factor Rotation and Market Dynamics
The performance of factors changes in line with economic conditions, leading to "factor rotation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Historically, the Momentum Factor has dominated during bull runs (e.g., 2014-2017, 2019, 2021), while the Value Index has taken charge during market slippages and corrections (e.g., 2018, 2020, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Predicting annual market movements to select the best-performing factor is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. However, indicators like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio can help gauge if markets are expensive, cheap, or neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Observing liquidity, volumes, and expert opinions can also provide insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

When compared to the four factor indices, the Nifty 50 TRI (Total Return Index) has generally been a poor performer, typically ranking fourth or fifth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The difference in returns between the best-performing factor and the Nifty 50 can be substantial, often representing significant "Alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

[[factor_investing_and_its_impact_on_portfolio_returns | Factor investing]] or smart beta funds are believed to immensely improve portfolio returns, potentially yielding up to 10% higher returns than the Nifty 50 if the right factor is chosen at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. It is strongly suggested that these strategies should be allocated in investment portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Ways to Invest in Factor-Based Strategies
There are three primary [[ways_to_invest_in_factorbased_strategies | ways to invest in factor-based strategies]]:

### 1. Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
As of early 2023, there were 18 factor-based mutual fund schemes and 22 exchange-traded funds available, a number that has been consistently growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### 2. Investment Platforms
Platforms like "Smallcase" offer numerous factor-based strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. These include:
*   Momentum strategies from providers like Capitalmind, Right Research, Weekend Investing, and Windmill Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   Smallcases focused on Quality Factor, Value Factor, and multi-factor strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   One example is the "Multi-Factor Dynamic Quantitative Algo" smallcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### 3. Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Strategy
For those with time and inclination, a DIY approach is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. A good starting point is to understand the index creation methodology used by Nifty indices and S&P Global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. With practice and automation, this can become a "delightful activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Important Considerations
*   **Factor Rotation:** Factors continuously rotate in performance; no single factor is a "sure shot" way to create wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Investment Strategy:** While Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are common, lump sum investments should be considered to exploit the right factor at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

Ultimately, [[factorbased_investing | factor-based investing]] involves defining and applying a set of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. It is seen as the future of index investing and a significant source of future wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

While the [[Market capitalization based index funds | Nifty 50 Index Fund]] is often the default thought when considering [[Overview of index funds in India | index funds in India]], there are many other types available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. This article focuses on two specific categories: [[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | Sector-based]] and [[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | Thematic Index Funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

## Sector-Based Index Funds

[[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | Sector-based index funds]] track a specific sector of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.

*   **Objective**: To track a specific sector such as banking, IT, transportation, healthcare, or energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**: Investing in a [[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | sector fund]] carries both incentive and danger due to the inherent peaks and troughs each industry or sector experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. The Nifty IT index, for example, has seen significant volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Risk**: Timing entry and exit is crucial for these funds, as volatility can lead to superlative returns if timed correctly, but also serious losses if predictions are wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

> [[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | Sector-based index funds]] are generally not suitable for all investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. If one chooses to invest, the aggregate exposure should not exceed 10% of the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## Thematic Index Funds

[[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | Thematic index funds]] focus on specific themes or trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

*   **Objective**: To identify and invest in future trends such as clean energy, consumption, infrastructure, defense, digital healthcare, or manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Distinction from Sector Funds**: Unlike [[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | sector funds]], [[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | thematic funds]] often present a bouquet of stocks that can be from the same or different industries and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
    *   For example, a healthcare fund might include hospitals, medical device manufacturers, health insurance companies, TPAs, medical loan providers, and technology companies developing hospital CRM software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. It encompasses an entire ecosystem, focusing on the enablers and beneficiaries of a trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Industry Trend in India**: The Indian mutual fund industry has been active in the [[sectoral_and_thematic_index_funds | thematic space]], with numerous launches in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Most of these are actively managed funds, but passively run schemes are expected if there is good response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Examples of existing passively run schemes include the ICICI Pro Nifty Auto index fund and the Navi Nifty India Manufacturing Index Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

[[Overview of index funds in India | Index funds]] have evolved significantly since the first publicly traded one was launched by Vanguard in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

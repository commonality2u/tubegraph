Risk management is a critical aspect of successful investing, aiming to protect against excessive risk and unnecessary losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Many common investment mistakes relate directly to poor risk management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Hibernation (Not Investing)
Investors often experience fear when markets are not looking good or when they are at an all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, even Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) started at all-time high points have yielded respectable returns of 10% to 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The state of "hibernation" (not investing at all) should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This relates to [[investing_during_market_volatility | investing during market volatility]].

### 2. Investing Without Clear Goals
Investing without a clear set of goals or objectives can lead to poor decision-making and below-average returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Assign a specific goal to each investment, such as SIPs, mutual funds, or EPF balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Use calculators to ensure goals are realistic and achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. For example, a Public Provident Fund (PPF) balance is not an appropriate emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### 3. Being Heavily Influenced by Others
Relying solely on advice from parents, agents, newspaper articles, or "stock gurus" can lead to costly financial mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Assess the expertise and incentives of the person offering advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A bank relationship manager, for instance, might have sales targets not aligned with your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   Populate all options and variables in a table and analyze alternatives based on your requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### 4. Unrealistic Expectations
Having unrealistic expectations about investment returns is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Be realistic about financial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. A goal of inflation plus 6% can be a suitable target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Stock markets tend to follow corporate earnings, growing predictably over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### 5. Ignoring Asset Allocation
Many investors choose various schemes (e.g., PPF, flexi-cap, small-cap, index funds) but lack a strategy for how these fit into their overall portfolio to improve risk-adjusted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Implement [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_stock_market_investing | asset allocation]] by diversifying across different asset classes (equity, debt, gold), industries, and geographical regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   Consider strategies like momentum, value, and quality factor investing in addition to market cap, as this can improve returns and reduce downside risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This is part of [[factor_investing_and_its_impact_on_portfolio_returns | factor investing]].

### 6. Not Researching Investments
Buying into investments without proper research increases the risk of poor decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. For instance, some bought shares of Bombay Oxygen Investment Company due to the word "oxygen" during a crisis, even though the company had stopped oxygen manufacturing in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Research and analyze companies, mutual funds, and other financial products using available resources like aggregation websites, screeners, articles, and videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and New Fund Offers (NFOs) should be approached with caution as they are "leaps of faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### 7. Impatience and Craving New Options
Investors often jump to new products or stocks driven by impatience or a desire to try something new, rather than a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Divide your portfolio into a core and satellite allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Objectively compare any new product or scheme with your existing holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### 8. Failure to Implement Risk Management Strategies
Many investors fail to use risk reduction strategies, leading to excessive risk and unnecessary losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Key Strategies:**
    *   **Portfolio Buildup:** Use [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_stock_market_investing | diversified assets]] like equity, gold, bonds, and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This includes [[strategies_for_diversifying_bond_investment_risk | strategies for diversifying bond investment risk]].
    *   **Stop-Loss:** Limit downside by setting stop-loss orders, especially when buying stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Exit Strategies:** Employ profit booking, time-based exits, or fundamental triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This is part of [[entry_and_exit_strategies_in_investing | entry and exit strategies]].
    *   **Periodic Rebalancing:** Regularly adjust asset allocation to maintain the desired risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
    *   **Avoid High P/E and Penny Stocks:** Steer clear of very high Price-to-Earnings ratio stocks and penny stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   **Be Cautious with Credit Risk Funds:** Understand that chasing slightly higher returns (e.g., 1-1.5% extra) in credit risk funds might expose you to significantly more risk by lending to lower-rated companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
    *   **Combine Offensive and Defensive Abilities:** Like a successful batsman, investors should exhibit both attacking (aggressive) and defending (conservative) abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This aligns with [[defensive_vs_enterprising_investing_strategies | defensive vs enterprising investing strategies]].

### 9. Relying on Stock Investment Tips
The stock-tipping industry often works on probability, creating an illusion of accuracy through schemes like splitting databases and sending opposite tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This, along with scams like pump and dump schemes, can lead to poor investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Avoid stock investment tips altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Trust your own research and analysis, or utilize the services of a qualified financial advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### 10. Performance Chasing
This refers to buying mutual funds based on recent strong performance, assuming past success will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Data shows that nearly 50% of top-ranked funds fall into the bottom half of the table in the very next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This is due to fund manager investing styles adapting to economic conditions and funds buying more units at expensive valuations after attracting more investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Focus on a fund's investment objective, long-term record, and consistency rather than just past performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### 11. Trying to Time the Market
Attempting to accurately predict when to buy and sell is extremely difficult to do consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Even "unluckiest" investors who consistently invest at market highs can achieve respectable annualized returns (e.g., 11-13%) over long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Avoid the pitfalls of frequent market timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Instead, consider scientific and tested [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | strategies]] that aim for consistent performance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### 12. Abandoning Tried-and-Tested Strategies Prematurely
Investors can become impatient if results take too long, leading them to abandon proven strategies in search of "better" ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Studies show a significant gap between fund returns and investor returns (e.g., actively managed equity funds: 19.1% vs. 13.8%; [[hybrid_funds_for_risk_management | hybrid funds]]: 12.5% vs. 7.4%) due to investor behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Many discontinue SIPs or sell investments during market falls, overreacting to short-term information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Learn to live with [[volatility_in_stock_markets_and_its_impact_on_investment_decisions | volatility]] and take advantage of market dips by doubling down on investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. If a company has been properly researched, do not abandon the investment unless there is a massive change in the investment thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

### 13. Overconfidence and Underconfidence
*   **Overconfidence:** Investing in something and then seeking justification for it, especially when on a hot streak, leads to excessive risk-taking and unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
    *   **Solution:** Recognize the limits of your knowledge and expertise, be thorough in research, continue learning, and seek diverse opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Underconfidence (Herd Mentality):** Making investment decisions based on popular trends or market sentiments rather than fundamental analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This is often seen with large company IPOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
    *   **Solution:** Base decisions on independent analysis, understanding of business models, and an investment's risk-return expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

### 14. Holding Onto Poorly Performing Stocks
This emotional behavior stems from attachment, reluctance to accept losses, or the expectation of recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Consider using a stop-loss (e.g., 30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. If an investment thesis goes wrong or confusion arises, exit the stock and redeploy capital into more promising opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Utilize tax loss harvesting where applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

### 15. Falling for Market Noise
The constant flow of news, opinions, and daily market fluctuations ("noise") can impact investor sentiment and lead to irrational, costly decisions based on short-term events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
*   **Example:** A 20% drop in a company's stock due to a price war in a small segment of its business, while ignoring that 90% of its portfolio was normal and growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Learn to filter out short-term noise to improve decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Smart investors can take advantage of such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

### 16. Neglecting Portfolio Rebalancing
Failing to periodically adjust asset allocation can lead to a shift in the portfolio's risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. For example, a 50/50 debt/equity portfolio could become 67/33 over 10 years without rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Rebalance your portfolio to reduce risk, capture gains, control losses, and improve risk-adjusted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Annual or bi-annual reviews (e.g., February/March or after receiving an annual bonus) are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

### 17. Not Tracking Investments
Many investors fail to track and monitor their investments, leading to unaccounted funds or missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Use online platforms or apps (e.g., Value Research Online, Groww, ET Money) to track mutual funds, monitor XIRR, asset mix, and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. For stocks, monitor news and announcements (e.g., using screener.in's watchlist feature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Tracking helps in analysis, staying updated, and identifying growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

### 18. Impatience (Premature Selling)
Prematurely selling investments, even after significant gains, can result in missing out on much larger long-term profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Adopt a long-term investing mindset and be patient. Big investors like Warren Buffett, Mohnish Pabrai, and Peter Lynch have built wealth through patience and long-term holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. As Warren Buffett said, "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

### 19. Ignoring Investment Fees and Expense Ratios
High fees and expense ratios can significantly eat into investment returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Understand the fee structure of every investment product, especially complex ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
    *   Opt for direct plans for SIPs where possible, as they are mathematically advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
    *   Explore index funds, especially in the large-cap category, due to their significantly lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

### 20. Using Tax as the Primary Investment Criterion
Making investment decisions purely based on tax benefits can lead to poor investment outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
*   **Example:** Purchasing LIC policies solely because the maturity amount is tax-free, despite offering only 5-7% returns, which barely keeps pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. Similarly, avoiding short-term capital gains tax at the expense of locking in lesser profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   **Solution:** While all investments should be evaluated on a post-tax basis, taxation should not be the sole reason for choosing an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

By addressing these common mistakes and implementing strategic risk management, investors can significantly improve their portfolio performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

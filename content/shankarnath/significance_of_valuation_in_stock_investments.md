Every investment strategy and fund manager experiences periods of success and challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Historically, figures like Warren Buffett faced criticism for ignoring technology stocks in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, and Prashant Jain's value investing principles drew flak in 2018-2019 for investing in PSUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Similarly, Mr. Sourabh Mukarji faced significant backlash for advocating the Coffee Can Investing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## The Coffee Can Investing Strategy Overview
Coffee Can Investing is a long-term, generally passive strategy that involves investing in 10 to 15 high-quality stocks and holding them for a prolonged period, typically 10 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Coined by Mr. Robert Kirby in the early 1980s, the term originated from a client who built substantial wealth by never exiting positions he had invested in based on Kirby's suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Essentially, it is a "buy and forget" approach, where a few positions are expected to dominate the portfolio, requiring investors to have patience and avoid constant interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

In India, the strategy gained prominence through the book "Coffee Can Investing: The Low-Risk Road to Stupendous Wealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Data presented in the book indicated that the Coffee Can Portfolio (CCP) consistently outperformed the Sensex in all 17 years examined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Companies like Asian Paints, Marico, HDFC Bank, and Relaxo, often CCP constituents, showed fewer negative periods compared to the Sensex over a 25-year span <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, suggesting the strategy's historical effectiveness in many countries, including India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## The Flaw: Ignorance to Valuation
Despite its historical success, the Coffee Can method currently faces criticism largely due to its significant flaw: it is "very ignorant to valuations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, a stance Mr. Mukarji is known to have upheld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

While there's a valid argument that a premium is deserved for quality companies with stability, growing sales, good profits, high Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), and strong economic moats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, ignoring [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuations]] entirely can be detrimental. The CCP's [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation]] trajectory illustrates this point:
*   Until FY14, the P/E ratio of the CCP portfolio was typically in the 22-25 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   By 2021-2022, this metric had jumped up to three times that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

The impact became evident from 2021 onwards, when the CCP's P/E multiple reached the 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. During this period, the portfolio struggled "exceedingly difficult" to beat its benchmark, the Nifty50 index, whose P/E ratio was less than half of the CCP's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

### Key Lesson: P/E Ratio Threshold
The first lesson in understanding Coffee Can portfolios is to avoid or resist allocating a large sum of money when the portfolio's P/E ratio exceeds 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. An analysis of the P/E ratios for the consistent compounder portfolio from 2012-2014, 2017-2019, and 2021-2023 shows an accelerating pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Over time, CCP stocks have become more expensive to acquire, leading to "almost no safety in valuations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This suggests that unless conditions are perfect, such a portfolio or its individual stocks are likely to underperform the index in the short to medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Improving the Strategy: The Filter Coffee Can Approach
The "Filter Coffee Can" approach introduces [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | valuation considerations]] to the traditional Coffee Can method through a series of five steps:

### Step 1: Identification of High-Quality and Well-Established Companies
This involves picking companies that have been in business for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a> and have consistently generated a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. This initial filter can yield a large list of companies, including both private biggies and public sector enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

### Step 2: Filtering for Sales Growth Consistency
The initial ROCE filter is not sufficient, as some established companies may have unimpressive sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. Therefore, the next step is to filter the list for a minimum sales growth of 10% over the last 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. This refinement significantly narrows down the list, ensuring consistency in both capital efficiency and progressive sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

### Step 3: Incorporating Valuation and Market Leadership
This step introduces crucial [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation]] and qualitative filters:
1.  **Avoiding Expensive Stocks:** The goal is to avoid "really expensive stocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. While the general CCP guideline sets a portfolio P/E of 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>, for the "Filter Coffee Can" portfolio, a preference is given to companies valued at a P/E multiple that is currently *lower* than its historical three-year P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. This filter significantly reduces the pool of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. Companies excluded due to high [[valuation_indicators_and_selling_strategies | valuations]] include Bharat Electronics (P/E 56), Varun Beverages (P/E 97), Polycab, Supreme Industries, Titan, Avenue Supermarts, and Dixon Technologies (P/E 190 at the time of recording) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
2.  **Market Leaders or Challengers:** Select only market leaders or prominent number two/three challengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. This ensures that the selected companies are sustainable and can persist for the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
3.  **Company Size (Optional):** While traditional CCPs often consist of large-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>, the speaker notes that a coffee can portfolio does not *have* to be limited to large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Different types of CCPs exist: conventional (large-cap blue chips), moonshot (mid, small, and micro caps for potential 10-100 baggers), and blended (a mix of both) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

### Step 4: Additional Proof of Growth and Sustainability
To gain a deeper understanding of a company's growth plans and sustainability, it is crucial to read quarterly earnings transcripts and related materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. This allows investors to identify how a company is evolving, where capital is being deployed, and its potential to remain a leader or top challenger in its chosen space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. This qualitative assessment aligns with practices of other investment firms, which consider factors like management quality, governance standards, competitive advantages, and [[importance_of_consistency_in_stock_investment | consistency of growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.

### Step 5: Investing and Ongoing Monitoring
The final step involves investing in a small number of high-quality companies, typically 10 to 15, ensuring sector diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. Investors should commit to holding these companies for an extended period (10, 15, or 20 years or more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>, resisting the influence of fear and greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>. Averaging up on shares, even after significant price increases, has proven beneficial for some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>.

Crucially, investors must continuously track the *businesses* in their coffee can portfolio, not just the stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>. This involves reading quarterly earnings transcripts, news articles, and research reports, while avoiding unreliable sources like social media shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The Coffee Can strategy, especially the refined "Filter Coffee Can" approach that incorporates [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | valuation]] considerations, remains highly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. It is considered one of the easiest and most formidable ways of creating wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>, particularly effective for mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. By conducting thorough research and adhering to the principles, investors can potentially achieve satisfactory long-term results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.

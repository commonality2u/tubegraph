From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

The Free Lunch Portfolio, as conceptualized by Mohnish Pabrai, is an investment strategy outlined in a Forbes article co-written by Pabrai in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. The core idea behind this portfolio is a "shameless strategy of cloning" what other successful investors are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This concept was born after Pabrai's 2008 lunch with Warren Buffett, for which he paid $650,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

## Mohnish Pabrai: An Introduction

Mohnish Pabrai's primary occupation is running the Pabrai Investment Funds, which manages over $700 million in Assets Under Management (AUM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. He also founded the Dakshana Foundation in 2005, which tutors and helps children from poor economic backgrounds attend elite higher learning institutions like the IITs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. Mr. Pabrai often describes himself as a "shameless cloner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, having invested in what Berkshire Hathaway was buying and even copying the Buffett partnership structure for his own funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

## Genesis of the Free Lunch Portfolio

The strategy leverages public information from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which requires individuals and entities investing at least $100 million in U.S. equity markets to disclose their holdings quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>. By simply cloning these holdings, a copycat portfolio generated an annualized return of 15.5% over a 17-year period, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 4.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This impressive alpha of 10.7% prompted Pabrai to start his own Free Lunch Portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Structure of the Free Lunch Portfolio

The Free Lunch Portfolio typically consists of 15 stocks, with five stocks in each of three different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>. While not identical to Mr. Pabrai's personal portfolio, it reflects his general investment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

The three categories are:
1.  Spawners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>
2.  Shameless Cloners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>
3.  Uber Cannibals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>

### Spawners

Spawners are companies with "incubation in their DNA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. They can leverage capital, infrastructure, and talent to initiate new businesses with the potential to become multi-billion dollar entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. These companies often have a "cash cow" business that generates revenue, which is then aggressively reinvested into other ventures, even unrelated ones, to fuel future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

Examples of spawners include Alphabet (Google) with ventures like YouTube, Nest, Fitbit, Android, Maps, and Waze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, and Disney with its film studio, theme parks, Pixar, and OTT channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Amazon, with its diverse portfolio including Amazon.com, Prime, AWS, and Kindle, is another example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

For 2023, the spawner stocks in the Free Lunch Portfolio are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>:
*   DAV Airports (operates 15 airports in eight countries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>
*   Restaurant Brands (28,000 restaurants in over 100 countries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>
*   Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>
*   Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>
*   Brookfield Corporation (recently spun off an asset management division; owns real estate, infrastructure, renewable power, and private equity assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>
    *   Berkshire Hathaway was part of this list until last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

### Shameless Cloners

[[mohnish_pabrai_investment_strategy | Mohnish Pabrai's investment strategy]] includes extensively copying the high-conviction bets of experienced, value-oriented investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. These "superstar investors" have decades of experience and expertise in specific sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. By reviewing their 13F filings, Pabrai realized he could replicate some of their strategies to build a stock portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

Key investors whose strategies are cloned include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>:
*   Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger (Berkshire Hathaway) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>
*   Bill Ackman (Pershing Square) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>
*   Eddie Lampert (ESL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>
*   Guy Spier (Aquamarine Fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>
*   David Tepper (Appaloosa Management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>
*   Li Lu (Himalaya Capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>
*   Mohnish Pabrai himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>

The 2023 Shameless Cloners list includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>:
*   Resource Logistics (Turkish company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>
*   Alphabet (picked by The Children's Investment Fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>
*   Chipotle (Pershing Square's high-conviction bet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>
*   Alibaba Holdings (by Appaloosa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>
*   Tencent (Value Partners are bullish on it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>

Notably, three of these five companies are not domiciled in the United States, providing international diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

[[analysis_of_the_2023_free_lunch_portfolio_stocks | The 2023 Shameless Cloners list]] includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>:
*   Resource Logistics (Turkish company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>

Notably, three of these five companies are not domiciled in the United States, providing international diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Uber Cannibals

Uber cannibals are companies that consistently buy back their own shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Companies engaging in buybacks typically possess substantial cash reserves, anticipate minimal competition or disruption, and believe their stock is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Share buybacks can increase an investor's stake in the company without additional capital, and also boost earnings per share (EPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

[[analysis_of_the_2023_free_lunch_portfolio_stocks | Mohnish Pabrai's Free Lunch Portfolio]] identifies five such companies for 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>:
*   Assured Guarantee (insurance and asset management; shares outstanding decreased from 183 million in 2011 to 86 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>
*   Primerica (shares outstanding decreased from 72 million to 40 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>
*   Navient (business process solutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>
*   Discover Financial Services (bought back over 40% of shares in the last decade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>
*   Jack in the Box (shares decreased from 31 million in 2017 to 21 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>
    *   Mr. Pabrai replaced Navient and Discover Financial Services with eBay and Toll Brothers earlier this month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

These companies possess solid free cash flows which they deploy to buy back their own shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Management and Performance

The Free Lunch Portfolio is a dynamic list, with Mr. Pabrai announcing constituents once a year but allowing flexibility for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

In terms of performance, the portfolio did not meet expectations in its first three years (2018, 2019, 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. However, after methodological changes in 2021, the Free Lunch Portfolio's performance has become much closer to that of the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. It is built around value principles like spin-offs, cash flows, and moats, which may take time to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

## Investment Approach

For those interested in investing in or replicating this portfolio, Pabrai recommends equal weighting the stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. For example, with $15,000 capital, one would invest $1,000 into each of the 15 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

## [[creating_an_indian_version_of_the_free_lunch_portfolio | Creating an Indian Version of the Free Lunch Portfolio]]

It's possible to build an Indian version of the Free Lunch Portfolio, given the availability of companies and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.

### Indian Spawners

Indian companies fitting the spawner definition include:
*   **Reliance Industries**: Its petrochemical refining, oil, and gas operations act as a cash cow, funding large businesses in unrelated areas like telecommunications, retail, media, and digital healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.
*   **Adani Group**: Has interests in ports, power, airports, and renewable energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.
*   **State Bank of India**: Beyond its stakes in subsidiaries, it has incubated Yono, its digital banking platform, valued at $40-50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
*   **Info Edge India**: Described as a digital Berkshire Hathaway of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.
*   **India Mart**: Has been actively acquiring various businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
*   **IEX (Indian Energy Exchange Limited)**: Has spawned IGX (Indian Gas Exchange), which is expected to have an IPO in the next 2-3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

### Indian Shameless Cloners

For identifying Indian shameless cloners, resources like "Superstar shareholder portfolios" on trendline.com provide lists of popular Indian investors and their recent stock transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. Examples include Rare Enterprises buying a stake in Raghav Productivity Enhancers and Mukul Agarwal investing in Toll Enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Once a list of recommendations is compiled, Pabrai's article suggests a randomized selection to mitigate personal biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

### Indian Uber Cannibals

Several Indian companies have consistently bought back shares:
*   **Balrampur Chini Mills**: Conducted six buybacks since 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.
*   **Wipro Limited**: Did buybacks in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.
    *   IT service companies often perform buybacks to deploy large cash reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.
*   **TCS (Tata Consultancy Services)**: Bought back shares worth ₹18,000 crores in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>, and also conducted buybacks in May 2017, August 2018, November 2020, and March 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.
*   **Infosys**: Bought back over 6 crore shares at ₹9,300 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.
*   **Aarti Drugs**: Conducted buybacks four times in 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.
*   **Jagran Prakashan Limited**: Has been active with buybacks in 2013, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.
*   Other companies that have consistently bought back shares include Nalco, Kaveri Seed, E-clerk Services, and Quick Heal Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.

The three constituents of the Free Lunch Portfolio each offer a compelling investment narrative, generally supported by performance numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>. As an active, stock-picking portfolio, it benefits from applying concepts such as identifying coffee can stocks, monopolies, the [[magic_formula_investing_strategy_by_joel_greenblatt | magic formula investing strategy by Joel Greenblatt]], cash-rich companies, and sector analysis to create an "opportunity portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

## The Power of Combined Indices

Investing a monthly sum in a large-cap index since 2007 would have yielded a return of 12.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A small-cap index would have performed slightly better, returning 13.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, by strategically combining these two indices, an annualized return of 16.3% is achievable, significantly higher than either index in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This article outlines simple steps to potentially achieve an additional 2-3% on investment capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Understanding Investor Behavior and Valuation

External events and their perception heavily influence investor interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Investors who favored large caps during uncertain periods (2009, 2013, 2020) were often the same individuals heavily invested in small caps in different years (2007, 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This suggests that a relative valuation range of 0.9 to 1.1 can serve as an important [[management_analysis_for_stock_investment | stock picking trigger]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Data Collection for Model Development

The first step in [[developing_small_case_investment_strategies | developing a model]] is to gather historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Required Data
*   Month-closing values for the Nifty 50 and Nifty Small Cap 250 indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Data Source
*   The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) website: Navigate to "Products," then "Equities," and click on "Historical Index Data" to select "Total Returns Index Value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While daily values are provided, they need to be converted into monthly numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   A pre-compiled Google Sheet with 15 years of monthly Nifty 50 and Small Cap 250 closing values, including various scenarios, is available via a link in the video's description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## [[Investing patterns and strategies | Investing Scenarios]] and Model Performance

Using the collected data, several [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investing scenarios]] can be analyzed to refine the [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investment strategy]].

### Scenario 1: Individual Index Performance (Baseline)
Analyzing individual performance over 15 years:
*   **Nifty 50 TRI (Total Returns Index):** An annualized return of 12.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A 10,000 rupee monthly SIP would grow to 55.5 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Nifty Small Cap 250 TRI:** A CAGR of 13.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. A 10,000 rupee monthly SIP would grow to over 60 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Pausing SIPs when Small Caps are Overvalued
If the relative valuation (small caps vs. large caps) crosses an upper limit of 1.1, small caps are considered overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Pausing SIPs during these "expensive" months (23 months in this 15-year period) can slightly improve returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This strategy yields an annualized return of 14.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Selling when Small Caps are Overvalued
Beyond pausing SIPs, actively selling units when small caps are expensive can further enhance returns. Selling 10,000 rupees worth of units every time the small-cap level crosses 1.1 provides an additional 0.3% lift, taking the annual return to 14.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Scenario 4: Buy Low, Sell High Strategy
This scenario involves both selling when small caps are expensive and buying when they are relatively cheaper, with varying quantities based on valuation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

*   **Selling Strategy:**
    *   Crosses 1.1: Sell 10,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
    *   Crosses 1.15: Sell an additional 10,000 rupees (total 20,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Crosses 1.2: Redeem a total of 30,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

*   **Buying Strategy:**
    *   Goes below 0.9: Invest an additional 10,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Goes below 0.85: Invest an additional 20,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   Goes below 0.8: Invest an additional 30,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

This strategy defines both the action (buy/sell) and the quantum of investment/redemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This aggressive approach delivered an impressive 16.3% annual return, a significant jump from the baseline returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Scenario 5: Long-Short Opportunity with Redeemed Capital
When small caps are relatively inexpensive (e.g., at 1.1 or 1.2 levels), large caps are often relatively cheap at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This opens up a "long-short opportunity": redemption money from small-cap units can be invested into Nifty 50 index funds simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This relative valuation-driven approach consistently yields a respectable 16% return over a 15-year period while also helping to accumulate a larger portfolio corpus by remaining invested in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Implementation

*   **Taxes:** While unavoidable, the speaker suggests not to overly concern oneself given that a larger portion of capital gains will likely be long-term, and the difference between STCG (short-term capital gains) and LTCG (long-term capital gains) may be minimal (e.g., 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Liquidity:** The ability to invest additional capital (10,000, 20,000, 30,000 rupees) is crucial. Lack of liquidity may lead to "slippages" in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Summary of Scenarios

The video explores five scenarios to illustrate how to [[reviewing_and_managing_investment_portfolios_for_optimal_returns | optimize investment returns]]:
1.  **Individual Index Performance:** Nifty 50 TRI and Nifty Small Cap 250 TRI in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
2.  **Pausing SIPs:** Halting investments in the "expensive zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
3.  **Selling SIPs:** Not just pausing, but actively selling units when expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
4.  **Buy Low, Sell High:** Implementing a dynamic buy and sell strategy based on valuation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
5.  **Reinvestment:** Using redemption money from small caps to invest in cheaper large caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Conclusion: Tactical Small-Cap Investing

Small-cap [[factor_investing_and_its_impact_on_portfolio_returns | investing]] is considered more tactical than [[simplifying_investment_portfolios | investing]] in large or mid-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. While SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) are advocated even for small caps, leveraging their inherent volatility can maximize performance, as demonstrated by these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This approach highlights the potential of [[predictive_analytics_in_investing | predictive analytics in investing]] to capture additional returns.

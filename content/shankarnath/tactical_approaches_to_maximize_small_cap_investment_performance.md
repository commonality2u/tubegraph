Investing in a blend of large cap and [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap]] indices can potentially yield higher returns than investing in either category in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, a combined portfolio has shown a return of 16.3%, significantly higher than the 12.8% from a large cap index or 13.8% from a [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap]] index when analyzing investments made since 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article explores tactical steps to achieve an extra 2-3% on investment capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Role of Relative Valuation in Investment Decisions

External events and their perception heavily influence investor interest in different market capitalizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Investors might favor large caps during uncertain periods (e.g., 2009, 2013, 2020) and [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small caps]] during other times (e.g., 2007, 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. A relative valuation range of 0.9 to 1.1 serves as a critical stock picking trigger that can be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Data Collection for Analysis

To develop an investment model, it's necessary to collect month-closing values for the Nifty 50 and Nifty Small Cap 250 indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This data can be found on the NSC India website by navigating to Products > Equities > Historical Index Data > Total Returns Index Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Monthly data for the past 15 years for both indices is also available in a Google Sheet linked in the video's description, which includes various investment scenarios discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Investment Scenarios and Performance

Here's an examination of different investment strategies using the Nifty 50 TRI and Nifty Small Cap 250 TRI data:

### Scenario 1: Individual Index Performance (Baseline)

Analyzing individual index performance over 15 years through monthly SIPs:
*   **Nifty 50 TRI:** Annualized return of 12.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A ₹10,000 monthly SIP would grow to ₹55.5 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Nifty Small Cap 250 TRI:** CAGR of 13.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. A ₹10,000 monthly SIP would grow to over ₹60 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Pausing SIPs when Small Caps are Overvalued

This strategy involves pausing monthly SIPs in [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small caps]] when their relative valuation crosses an upper limit of 1.1, indicating they are overvalued compared to large caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Result:** By excluding capital investment during 23 such expensive months, the annualized return improved slightly to 14.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This represents an extra 0.3% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Redeeming Units when Small Caps are Overvalued

Beyond pausing SIPs, this strategy includes selling [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap]] units when they become expensive.
*   **Action:** Selling ₹10,000 worth of units every time the small cap level crosses 1.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Result:** This led to an additional 0.3% lift, taking the annual return to 14.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Scenario 4: Buy Low, Sell High Strategy

This is a more dynamic approach that involves both selling when small caps are expensive and buying more when they are relatively cheaper, beyond the regular monthly SIP.

*   **Selling Triggers (Small Caps Expensive):**
    *   Relative valuation crosses 1.1: Sell ₹10,000 worth of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
    *   Relative valuation crosses 1.15: Sell an additional ₹10,000 (total ₹20,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Relative valuation reaches 1.2: Redeem a total of ₹30,000 worth of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Buying Triggers (Small Caps Cheaper):**
    *   Relative valuation goes below 0.9: Invest an additional ₹10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Relative valuation reaches 0.85: Invest an additional ₹20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
    *   Relative valuation reaches 0.8: Invest an additional ₹30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *(These additional investments are on top of the regular ₹10,000 monthly SIP in the Nifty Small Cap 250 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.)*
*   **Result:** This strategy significantly boosts returns, delivering an impressive 16.3% in annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Scenario 5: Long-Short Opportunity (Redeeming Small Caps and Investing in Large Caps)

This advanced approach leverages the inverse relationship between small cap and large cap valuations. When [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small caps]] are relatively expensive (e.g., at 1.1 or 1.2 relative valuation levels), large caps are often relatively cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Action:** When redeeming units from the [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap]] 250 fund, concurrently buy units in a Nifty 50 Index Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Result:** This relative valuation-driven approach not only provides a respectable return of 16% over a 15-year period but also helps accumulate a larger portfolio corpus by generally remaining invested in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Additional Considerations

*   **Taxes:** While taxes are unavoidable, the difference between Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) and Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) (typically 5%) might not be a significant deterrent, especially since a larger portion of gains will likely be long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Liquidity:** The ability to invest additional sums (₹10,000, ₹20,000, ₹30,000) during opportune times is crucial. Lack of liquidity might lead to slippages in expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[small_cap_investing_strategy | Small cap investing]] is inherently more tactical compared to investing solely in large or mid caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. While Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are beneficial even in [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small caps]], actively leveraging their volatility through strategies like "buy low, sell high" can significantly maximize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

While the Nifty 50 Index Fund is often the default thought when considering index funds, there is a much broader variety available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This article explores 11 different types of index funds, offering diverse options for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## What is an Index?
An index is a system that identifies specific stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments from a larger universe based on a defined methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

## Types of Index Funds

### 1. Broad Market Index Funds
The objective of a broad market index fund is to track a significant portion of the entire market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
*   **Example in India:** The Nifty 500 index represents approximately 96% of the total market capitalization of companies listed on the NSE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Motilal Oswal offers a fund that tracks this index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Over-Diversification
> Over-diversification does not refer to a high number of stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Instead, it occurs when capital is allocated to lower-conviction ideas rather than focusing on high-conviction ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This concept is relevant to active investing and does not apply to passive or index investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### 2. Market Capitalization Based Index Funds
These funds are structured based on specific ranges of market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Large Cap:** Nifty 50 (companies typically over 1 lakh crores market cap), Nifty Next 50, Nifty 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>
*   **Mid Cap:** Nifty Midcap 150 (companies between 16,000 to 45,000 crores), Midcap 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>
*   **Small Cap:** Small Cap 250, Small Cap 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>

#### Free Float Market Capitalization
Companies within these indices are selected based on their free float market capitalization, which includes only shares readily available for trading in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This excludes holdings by promoters, government, strategic investors, or locked-in shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. For example, while the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is the 11th largest company by total market cap, it ranks 146th on a free-float basis due to the government holding over 96% of its shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This keeps LIC out of the Nifty 50 list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:09]</a>.

#### Issue with Market Cap Based Indices
A common concern with market cap-based indices is that a few large companies can heavily influence the index, potentially skewing performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. For instance, the top five companies in the Nifty 50 (Reliance, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys, and HDFC) collectively account for about 50% of its weightage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. As index funds grow in India, this can make larger companies potentially overvalued at the expense of smaller ones within the index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

### 3. Equal Weight Index Funds
[[equity_oriented_index_funds_in_india | Equal weight index funds]] address the concentration issue by assigning the same weight to every constituent company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. For the Nifty 50, each company would receive an equal 2% weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This approach typically offers greater sectoral diversity compared to market cap-weighted indices, leading to variations in returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

### 4. Hybrid Index Funds
Hybrid index funds combine different asset classes or sub-asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   **Equity-Debt Combination:** The Nifty 50 Hybrid Composite Debt 70:30 index, for example, can be used to benchmark aggressive portfolios with a majority [[asset_allocation_for_indian_stocks | asset allocation]] in equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Equity Sub-Asset Combination:**
    *   Nifty Mid Smallcap 400: Used for benchmarking portfolios heavily invested in mid and small-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.
    *   Nifty 500 Multi-cap 50:25:25 Index: Suitable for benchmarking a broad [[asset_allocation_for_indian_stocks | equity portfolio]] composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
    *   Nifty Large Mid Cap 250 Index: Comprises 100 large-cap and 150 mid-cap companies, with each capitalization set having a 50% weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Edelweiss operates an index fund mimicking this, positioned as a passively managed alternative to flexi-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

### 5. [[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | Sector Based Index Funds]]
These funds track specific sectors like banking, IT, transportation, healthcare, or energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. While they offer potential for superlative returns during peak cycles, they also carry significant risk due to the inherent volatility of industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Timing entry and exit is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. It is generally advised that aggregate exposure to these funds should not exceed 10% of one's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

### 6. [[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | Thematic Index Funds]]
[[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | Thematic funds]] focus on specific themes or trends such as clean energy, consumption, infrastructure, defense, digital healthcare, or manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. Unlike sector funds, they aim to identify future trends and can include a bouquet of stocks from various industries and sectors that enable or benefit from that trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. For example, a healthcare fund might include hospitals, medical device manufacturers, insurance companies, medical loan providers, and technology companies developing hospital CRM software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

### 7. Factor Based Index Funds (Smart Beta)
Also known as smart beta index funds, these invest in stocks that meet specific criteria beyond market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. They are built around variables such as P/E ratio, dividend yield, book value, cash flow, and sales, aiming to identify attractively valued companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.
*   **Important Factors:** Value (P/B, P/E, dividend yield), Momentum (price and volume based), Quality (various attributes), Low Volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.
Many new fund launches in India have been in this category, reflecting its growing global popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

### 8. Strategy Based Index Funds
These index funds employ various strategies, often utilizing techniques typically associated with hedge funds, to generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage:** An example is the Nifty 50 TR 2x Leverage index, which aims to magnify exposure to the Nifty 50 by a factor of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. While difficult to find in India, such funds exist internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.
*   **Other Techniques:** Strategies like arbitrage, futures, dividends, inverse indexing, beta, and currency can also be used to construct indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. While not yet mainstream in India, these could become more common in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

### 9. [[international_index_fund_options | International Index Funds]]
[[international_index_fund_options | International index funds]] invest in stocks and ETFs outside of India, tracking global indices such as the NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, or MSCI World Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.
*   **Growth and Challenges:** Interest in these funds surged with the NASDAQ's rise until 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. However, 2022 saw performance dips and SEBI restrictions on fresh subscriptions due to an RBI-mandated $7 billion limit for overseas investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.
*   **Role in Portfolio:** Despite challenges, [[international_index_fund_options | international funds]] play an important role in an investor's [[asset_allocation_for_indian_stocks | asset allocation]] structure, not only for returns but also due to their often weak correlation with domestic funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. For example, the NYSE FANG+ index has a correlation of just 0.15 with the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. Investors should study each fund individually once restrictions are lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

### 10. Debt Based Index Funds
Beyond equities, a significant number of debt-based index funds are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. These funds are passively managed, track a benchmark, follow specific methodologies, and have low expense ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>.
*   **Target Maturity Funds:** These are popular bond indices that allow investors to disregard short-term price movements caused by interest rate changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. They generally have almost no credit risk as they primarily consist of Government of India bonds, state development loans, or AAA-rated PSU bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. They come with various maturities and asset mixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.
*   **Other Types:** Short duration and overnight index funds also exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.

### 11. Socially Responsible (ESG) Index Funds
These funds have gained popularity as investors increasingly care about the social and environmental impact of their investments, in addition to financial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. The aim is to invest in companies aligned with ESG principles while excluding those involved in firearms, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, or polluting industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. While the ESG trend is not yet as strong in India, it has significantly picked up pace in developed markets, with an estimated $37.8 trillion in assets under management globally in FY 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Index Funds in India
Since the Vanguard group launched the first publicly traded index fund in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>, index funds have evolved considerably. With a wide range of options, permutations, and combinations now available, index funds can address a large part of an investor's core portfolio needs, including large-cap, mid-cap, and [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | small-cap funds]], factor funds, [[international_index_fund_options | international funds]], bond funds, and even tax-saving funds (ELSS index funds, as allowed by SEBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.

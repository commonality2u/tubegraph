The question of whether [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] or lumpsum investing is better is frequently asked, and the answer is that both are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Understanding the Approaches

*   **[[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] (Systematic Investment Plan)**: This is a tried, tested, and highly effective system of investing that ensures continuity in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It smoothens the cost of acquisition and removes the need to worry about [[Value SIP and market timing | timing the markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] investing provides stability to wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Lumpsum Investment**: This approach is more tactical in nature, focusing on market fluctuations, short-term declines, sudden movements in the risk-reward equation, and market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Lumpsum investments are likened to "energy boosters" for wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Both methods are necessary for an optimal investment [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Case for a Combined [[customizing_sip_plus_lumpsum_strategies | SIP plus Lumpsum Strategy]]

While there is much theoretical support for a [[customizing_sip_plus_lumpsum_strategies | SIP plus lumpsum way of wealth building]], data to back this approach is scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Most available comparisons focus on "[[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] versus lumpsum" rather than their combined power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The inspiration for this video came from a tweet suggesting a combined [[customizing_sip_plus_lumpsum_strategies | SIP plus lumpsum strategy]] is a powerful combination for wealth building, hinting at a tactical "buying the dip" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Data-Backed Analysis (Nifty50: Jan 2007 - Dec 2023)

The analysis used Nifty50 data from January 2007 to December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

#### Base Scenario: Pure [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]]

*   A simple monthly [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] of 10,000 rupees over 17 years (2007-2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Investment**: Over 20 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Corpus Built**: 61.4 lakhs rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **CAGR (excluding dividends)**: 11.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This 11.8% serves as the base scenario for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

#### Experiment 1: Lumpsum on 5%+ Monthly Correction

*   **Condition**: An additional lumpsum investment of 50,000 rupees whenever the Nifty50 index dropped by 5% or more over a single month's closing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Opportunities**: In the last 17 years, there were only 20 such occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Six of these occurred in 2008, with the last in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This shows it's not a very practical [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | strategy]] due to long waiting periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Results**:
    *   Total lumpsum invested (50,000 x 20) = 10 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   Total amount invested (SIP + Lumpsum) = 30.4 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   Corpus swelled to over 1 crore rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   **Annualized Return (CAGR)**: Remained at 11.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This surprising result suggests that early investments, even large ones, might have a low weight in the discounting function over long periods, thus not significantly impacting the overall XIRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

#### Experiment 2: Lumpsum on 15% Dip from All-Time High

*   **Condition**: A lumpsum investment when the Nifty goes down by 15% from its all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Opportunities**: In the last 10 years, this yielded only six investing opportunities (a couple in 2016 and four in 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This high percentage also proved impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

#### Experiment 3: Lumpsum on 2% Monthly Correction

*   **Condition**: A lumpsum investment when the Nifty50 dipped by at least 2% in a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Opportunities**: Many more opportunities presented themselves. In 2021-2023 alone, there were 12 such opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Results (2021-2023, rising market)**:
    *   **SIP only**: 14.9% annualized return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
    *   **[[customizing_sip_plus_lumpsum_strategies | SIP plus Lumpsum strategy]]**: 16.4% annualized return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   **Improvement**: An incremental 1.5% in returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Results (Jan 2018 - Dec 2019, flat market)**: Applying the same logic showed the same 1.5% differential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Conclusion**: A [[customizing_sip_plus_lumpsum_strategies | SIP plus lumpsum strategy]] based on a 2% monthly dip does have more "legs" compared to an [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]]-only approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Practical Limitations and Customizations

The previous simulations assumed an unlimited supply of lumpsum money, which is not realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. For example, in 36 months (Jan 2021-Dec 2023), 12 lumpsum investments of 50,000 rupees each (6 lakh rupees) were simulated, while [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] investments were only 3.6 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

To address this, a second layer of limitation was added:
*   **Annual Lumpsum Budget**: Only 1 lakh rupees of lumpsum money available each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Deployment Condition**: Max 50,000 rupees could be invested in each half of the year, on the first available lumpsum opportunity (2% dip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. If no opportunity arose, the 50,000 rupees remained unutilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

*   **Results with Limitations (3-year period)**: It was possible to deploy the 50,000 rupee lumpsum in each of the six half-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
    *   **Annualized Return**: 15.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
    *   Applying this over the entire 17-year period also showed improvement in the investment-to-wealth ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

This highlights the complexity of a [[customizing_sip_plus_lumpsum_strategies | SIP plus lumpsum strategy]], as it can be played in hundreds of different ways (e.g., carry-forwarding amounts, different dip percentages, varying frequencies like weekly or daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Recommended [[customizing_sip_plus_lumpsum_strategies | SIP plus Lumpsum Strategy]] Steps

1.  **Set up your [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]]s**: Preferably on the first day or first week of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
2.  **Divide your lumpsum money**: Break it into two or more chunks (e.g., 50,000 rupees for each half of the year from a 1 lakh annual budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
3.  **Set up the condition for deploying lumpsum**: This could be a 2%, 5%, or other percentage dip, or even based on moving averages. The key is to have a defined system or condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
4.  **Set up alerts**: Use screening portals and brokerage platforms to get alerts for your specified conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
5.  **Implement**: Deploy the [[customizing_sip_plus_lumpsum_strategies | SIP plus lumpsum method]] on the respective trigger dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

Simulating this method on a worksheet can provide a more profound understanding and help in customizing the approach to see its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. If you find a better way to deploy this [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | strategy]], sharing it with data, assumptions, and limitations is encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

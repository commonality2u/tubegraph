The [[trending_value_strategy_overview | Trending Value Strategy]] is an investment approach that has demonstrated significant outperformance against the broader market index, yielding an annualized return of 21.19% from January 1964 to December 2009, turning an initial $10,000 into over $69 million over a 45-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy was first introduced by James O'Shaughnessy in his book *What Works on Wall Street*, which focuses on identifying winning investment strategies through backtesting and analyzing historical market data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Core Concept: Combining Momentum and Value

The phrase "trending value" combines two key investment principles: "trending" (representing [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]]) and "value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The [[trending_value_strategy_overview | strategy]] aims to maximize the potential of both [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum investing]] and [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Unlike previous approaches that might allocate equal parts to [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]] and [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value]] (which previously yielded a 16.2% annualized return over 17 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, the [[trending_value_strategy_overview | trending value strategy]] seeks to select stocks that are both undervalued and have demonstrated strong price [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

O'Shaughnessy's research illustrates the power of combining these factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:
*   The index compounded at 11.2% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   A pure [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value]] strategy (using O'Shaughnessy's value composite 2 indicator) delivered 17.3% on an annualized basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   A pure [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum strategy]] (buying stocks with the best six-month price appreciation) yielded 14.5% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   By combining [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value]] and [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]], the [[trending_value_strategy_overview | trending value strategy]] achieved an average yearly return of 21.2% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | technofundamental portfolio]] not only outperforms the index but also surpasses single-factor strategies, with the added benefit of lower volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## [[constructing_a_trending_value_stock_portfolio | Constructing a Trending Value Stock Portfolio]]

[[constructing_a_trending_value_stock_portfolio | Constructing a trending value portfolio]] involves a two-step process: calculating a value score and then a [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]] score.

### Calculating the Value Score

The value score is derived from six fundamental metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:

1.  **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Multiple**: Current share price divided by EPS. Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
2.  **Price-to-Book Value (P/B)**: Popular for capital-intensive businesses. Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
3.  **Price-to-Cash Flow from Operations**: Gauges market valuation of cash flow generation. Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
4.  **Price-to-Sales (P/S)**: O'Shaughnessy's preferred metric. Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
5.  **EV-to-EBITDA**: Assesses overall company value (market cap + debt to earnings). Lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
6.  **Dividend Yield**: Companies with higher dividends relative to share price are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. (Note: Some methodologies might use shareholder yield instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>).

The process to calculate the value composite score involves several steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>:
*   **Step 1: Define the Universe**: Select companies based on a minimum market capitalization (e.g., 500 crores, yielding over 1,500 companies in one example) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Step 2: Collect Data**: Gather the six required metrics for each company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Step 3: Organize Data**: Download information into a worksheet for easy handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Step 4: Allocate Deciles**: For each of the six variables, rank all companies and assign a score based on their decile. For example, a company in the first decile (top 10% for value) receives 1 point, while a company in the fifth decile receives 5 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. A lower score indicates the company is more undervalued on that parameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Step 5: Apply Across All Variables**: Repeat the decile allocation for all six metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Step 6: Sum Scores**: Add up the scores from all six metrics to get a cumulative value score for each company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Calculating the Momentum Score

The next part of the [[trending_value_strategy_overview | strategy]] is to determine the [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]] score by identifying companies with strong stock performance over a defined period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Reduce Universe**: First, narrow down the universe of companies to only those in the top decile based on their combined value scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. For example, if there are 1,500 companies, the top 150 (those with the lowest value scores, e.g., 7 to 16) are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Six-Month Price Return**: For these selected companies, extract their six-month price return (stocks whose price has risen the most in the past 6 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Select Top Stocks**: Sort this list in descending order by six-month price return and choose the top 25 stocks to form the [[trending_value_strategy_overview | trending value portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. While 25 is a common number, O'Shaughnessy explored different combinations, finding 25 yielded the highest and best risk-adjusted portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## [[portfolio_management_and_rebalancing_for_trending_value_strategy | Portfolio Management]]

The selected 25-stock portfolio is [[portfolio_management_and_rebalancing_for_trending_value_strategy | rebalanced]] on an annual basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. As of November 10, 2023, a specific list of 25 stocks would comprise such a portfolio, displaying characteristics like low P/E ratios, low P/B ratios, and attractive price-to-sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Observations and Characteristics

*   **Price Movement**: Much of the price appreciation in these stocks often occurs within the last three years, attributing to the [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]] aspect of the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Many of these stocks might have been "hibernating" during periods when growth strategies were popular, experiencing massive jumps when [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value stocks]] gained attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Market Style Influence**: The prevailing market style (growth or [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value]]) significantly impacts the performance of these stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of annual [[portfolio_management_and_rebalancing_for_trending_value_strategy | rebalancing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Financial Metrics**:
    *   Return on Capital (ROC) for many stocks in the portfolio is often in single digits, typical of classical [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   Sales growth also tends to be in single digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth tends to be better, reflecting the cyclical nature of these stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Value Focus**: The strategy can be viewed primarily as a [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value portfolio]] where the [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]] component helps ensure stocks are not falling into a "value trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Performance in the Indian Context

A study by Capitalmind backtested the [[trending_value_strategy_overview | trending value strategy]] on Indian stocks over a 16-year period (2007-2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>:
*   **Market Capitalization**: Approximately 79% of the trades involved companies ranked between 500 and 1,500 in terms of market capitalization, suggesting it primarily functions as a [[value_and_contrarian_investing | small cap strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Returns**: The study revealed that micro-caps were the biggest winners, indicating where the [[trending_value_strategy_overview | strategy]] truly thrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. It delivered a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.6% over the 16-year period, while the Nifty50 returned 9.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This represents an Alpha of approximately 10%, consistent with O'Shaughnessy's findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Volatility**: Although the [[trending_value_strategy_overview | trending value strategy]] is expected to reduce volatility, the Indian study showed an opposite effect, with higher volatility and drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This is justified because the strategy favors small and micro-cap stocks, which inherently display higher volatility and drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Consistent Outperformance**: Rolling returns over a 10-year period consistently showed the [[trending_value_strategy_overview | strategy]] outperforming the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

> [!NOTE] Before implementing the [[trending_value_strategy_overview | trending value strategy]], consider these points:
> 1.  **Small and Micro-Cap Focus**: It is primarily a small and micro-cap strategy, mimicking these market cycles, which typically offer high returns but are extremely volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
> 2.  **Predominance of Value Stocks**: Expect a portfolio dominated by [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value stocks]], characterized by low P/E ratios (e.g., less than 12) and annual sales exceeding market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
> 3.  **Lumpy Returns**: Returns from this strategy often come in "bulk," meaning there can be muted performance for several quarters or years, followed by sudden spikes in returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
> 4.  **Investor Suitability**: This strategy is not suitable for all investors, especially those oriented towards growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. It is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that demands a high tolerance for volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Despite its demanding nature, the [[trending_value_strategy_overview | trending value strategy]] has performed well globally and is a valuable tool for an investor's toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

The "Losers portfolio" is an [[contrarian_investing_principles | investing strategy]] that involves intentionally buying stocks that have experienced significant price declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This approach is inspired by an analysis cited by Professor Aswath Damodaran in his book *Investment Fables* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Damodaran's analysis suggested that purchasing the 35 biggest losers from the previous year and holding them for five years could generate a 30% cumulative excess return over the broader market, based on US data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Conceptual Basis

The potential success of the Losers portfolio is attributed to two primary reasons:
*   **[[mean_reversion_and_contrarian_principles | Mean Reversion]]**: The principle suggests that if a stock's price has fallen significantly, it tends to revert to its long-term average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **[[contrarian_investing_principles | Contrarian Principles]]**: By investing in poorly performing stocks, one is acting against the prevailing market sentiment, which studies have shown can be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Methodology for Constructing a Losers Portfolio

The general approach involves identifying stocks with a significant price decline. While "significant" is subjective, a common cut-off is a maximum drop of 50% in stock price, to avoid companies with fundamental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

For a study conducted on the Indian stock market over a 10-year period (from April 2014 onwards), the following steps were taken:
1.  **Company Selection**: Extract a list of companies with a market capitalization over 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The study included 1,348 companies that were in existence in 2014 and continue to exist today, though this introduces a survivorship bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
2.  **Price Data Extraction**: Obtain the financial year closing price (as of March 31st) for each selected stock from 2014 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
3.  **Loser Identification**: For each year, identify the 35 worst-performing stocks based on their one-year returns, applying the 50% price drop cut-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Companies like Rajesh Exports and Raj Ron Industries were excluded if their drop exceeded 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Conversely, companies like Primo Chemicals, Best Agrolife, and 197 Delta Corp might qualify within this framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
4.  **Portfolio Investment**: An equal amount (e.g., 10,000 rupees) is hypothetically invested in each of the 35 identified loser stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
5.  **Performance Tracking**: The portfolio's value is tracked over the next 12 months and compared against a broader market index like the Nifty 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Performance Analysis on Indian Market (2015-2024)

A 9-year study on the Indian stock market showed that the Losers portfolio, perhaps ironically, has outperformed the broader Nifty 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

*   **FY 2015-2016**: The Losers portfolio returned 55%, while the Nifty 500 returned -6.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **FY 2016-2017**: The Losers portfolio delivered 51%, compared to Nifty 500's 25.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **FY 2017-2018**: The Losers portfolio returned 23%, against Nifty 500's 12.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **FY 2018-2019**: The Losers portfolio delivered a negative 9% return, while the Nifty 500 saw a positive 9.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This period, potentially influenced by drops in mid- and small-cap stocks, suggests the strategy may underperform during sharp market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **FY 2019-2020 (COVID impact)**: The portfolio lost 54%, significantly more than Nifty 500's 27% loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This further supported the hypothesis that the Losers portfolio performs poorly in bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **FY 2020-2021 (Recovery)**: The Losers portfolio surged by 231%, against Nifty 500's 77% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **FY 2021-2022**: The portfolio grew by 9%, while the Nifty 500 delivered -1.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **FY 2022-2023**: The Losers portfolio yielded -11.8%, contrasting with Nifty 500's 40.5% positive gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Long-Term Cumulative Performance

If an investor had consistently invested 10,000 rupees in the top 35 loser stocks each year from 2015 to 2023 (a staggered investment of 31.5 lakh rupees), the portfolio's value as of March 31, 2024, would have been a staggering 223 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This translates to a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 38.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. In comparison, the Nifty 50 would have delivered 14.7% and even a top-performing actively managed mutual fund like Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund would have yielded 21.5% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## Observations and Limitations

### Importance of System Adherence
The Losers portfolio works best when treated as a systematic methodology, strictly adhering to defined rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The performance often relies on a few outlier stocks generating significant returns, such as Dwarikesh Sugar which grew over 10 times in one year and contributed heavily to the FY 2015-2016 portfolio's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Removing just a few high-performing stocks (e.g., Orchid Pharma, Best Agrolife, Patanjali Foods, Raj Ron Industries) from a previous analysis caused a 91% CAGR to crash to 31% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This variability means investors must resist the temptation to sell winning stocks early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Optimal Holding Period
Analysis of trailing returns across years suggests that the first one to three years tend to be the most profitable for loser stocks, with the "bump up" dissipating over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Therefore, for those experimenting with this strategy, a holding period of one, two, or a maximum of three years is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### Survivorship Bias
A significant limitation of the study is the presence of survivorship bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The data only includes companies that were in existence 10 years ago and are still trading today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This means companies that were losers and subsequently delisted, acquired, merged, or liquidated were not included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Including these non-existent companies would likely reduce the overall returns, though the exact impact is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

## Implementation Considerations

If considering building a Losers portfolio, one can start with a list of currently poorly performing stocks. While not strictly necessary to copy, investors can apply additional fundamental analysis criteria such as:
*   Sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   EPS growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>
*   PEG ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   Promoter shareholding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
*   Interest coverage ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
*   Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>

It is important not to over-complicate the strategy with too many criteria and to treat it as a disciplined system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. While investing is a game of probabilities, the Losers portfolio has demonstrated potential and is worthy of consideration as a small experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

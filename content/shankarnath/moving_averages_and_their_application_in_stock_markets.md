Moving averages are a popular and effective tool utilized by investors and traders to make informed decisions in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. The concept was researched in detail by Kunal, inspired by Dolly Khana's use of the 30-day moving average for investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## What is a Moving Average?

A moving average is a calculation used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Unlike a static average, a moving average continuously updates as new data becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

For instance, if you have five number boxes with values, their average might be 4.8. When a sixth box comes in, the calculation shifts, excluding the first box and including the sixth, resulting in a new average like 5.6. This continuous recalculation reveals a pattern over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

This methodology is applied to stock prices. For example, the 5-day moving average for HDFC Bank on September 22, 2023, was calculated as the average of its last five trading sessions, amounting to 1,587 rupees and 49 paise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. By going backwards in time, a series of 5-day moving averages can be plotted on a chart, creating a smooth line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Common moving average periods include 15, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Why Use Moving Averages?

Moving averages support the concept of [[market_trends_and_indicators_analysis | mean reversion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Much like gravity, the idea is that anything that goes up must eventually come down, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. If an asset's current market price is significantly higher than its 50-day or 200-day moving average, it is presumed that the price will revert back to the mean value of these averages at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This allows investors to take advantage of periods of euphoria or pessimism until market conditions normalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## [[identifying_value_zones_using_moving_averages | Identifying Value Zones Using Moving Averages]]

The concept of a "potential value zone" refers to a specific range around a moving average where an index value or stock price often finds support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. While the actual index or stock price might be meandering and volatile, the moving average line is much smoother, indicating the underlying trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

When an index or stock price enters this value zone, it can be seen as a potential buying opportunity for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Historically, significant dips in the Nifty50, such as in 2008-2009, 2002, 2003, 2012, 2016, and 2020, presented such opportunities, leading to excellent returns for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Applying this to individual stocks, companies like HDFC Life Insurance, Wipro Limited, and Hero MotoCorp have recently offered value zone opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

While a 50-day moving average might provide fewer, but potentially stronger, value zones over a long period (e.g., five over 25 years for Nifty50), shorter durations like 15-day moving averages show more frequent opportunities but come with increased volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For indices, it's generally preferred to stay with middle-range moving averages, while for individual stocks, a 20-day or 30-day moving average might be more suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The choice of duration often depends on an investor's constant experimenting and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## [[50_day_moving_average_strategy | 50 Day Moving Average Strategy]]

Here are five steps to use the 50-day moving average as an investment strategy:

1.  **Identify Stocks**: Begin by selecting a universe of 30-50 fundamentally strong companies that you are comfortable analyzing. Utilize screeners, stock filters, or themes available on platforms like the FISDOM app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
2.  **Look for Crossings**: Identify stocks whose price has just crossed above their 50-day moving average. This can be extracted from standard screeners and indicates that the stock is in an uptrend or has recently turned bullish, signaling potential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
3.  **Invest and Hold**: Invest in these stocks when the price goes above the 50-day moving average. Remain in the trade until the stock price falls below the 50-day moving average levels, signaling a potential bearish period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
4.  **Monitor Regularly**: Continuously monitor the stock prices and their moving averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
5.  **Diversify Portfolio**: Diversify your portfolio to mitigate risk, as all investment strategies involve some element of speculation and no future performance can be guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Performance Analysis

When applied to the Nifty50 index as an investment strategy (investing when Nifty50 crosses above its 50-day moving average), a 10,000 rupees investment in each of the 19 identified months from January 2019 to September 2023 would have resulted in a corpus of 2.86 lakh rupees, yielding an XIRR of 16.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. In comparison, a systematic investment plan (SIP) of 10,000 rupees every month during the same period would have given an annualized return of 16.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

While this strategy shows similar performance on an index like Nifty50, it tends to work much better on individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. For a small grouping of five stocks from different industries, the moving average strategy extracted a much higher return compared to systematically investing in that portfolio or in the Nifty50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Golden Crossover Strategy

The golden crossover is a [[technical_analysis_in_turnaround_stocks | technical analysis]] strategy that primarily uses two moving averages: the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Its objective is to identify potential shifts in a stock's price trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

A golden crossover occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses **above** the 200-day moving average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This indicates that the short-term price trend (50-day MA) is becoming more positive, signaling increased buying interest and a bullish trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. For an investor, this represents a reasonably good opportunity to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

For example, Infosys has experienced multiple golden crossovers:
*   **2018**: Led to a 54% stock price increase over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **July 2020**: Resulted in a 150% jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

Similar to the 50-day moving average strategy, the golden crossover strategy also performs better with individual stocks than with an index like the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Other Key Observations

*   **Distance between Price and Moving Averages**: The gap between the Nifty50 index and its 200-day moving average has historically never been above 19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Typically, this gap ranges between 7% and 12%, barring a few outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. If this gap widens significantly (e.g., 18%, 19%, or 20%), it can be interpreted as a sell signal or a warning for investors to be cautious and wait for markets to cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Market Strength Indication**: Moving averages can also hint at the strength of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. For instance, if a majority (e.g., 70%) of Nifty50 companies have a current market price above their 50-day moving average, it signals that the market is still strong according to [[technical_analysis_in_turnaround_stocks | technical indicators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Moving averages, as a strategy, offer a valuable tool for both traders and investors. They help to [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | identify potential value zones]], pinpoint ideal entry points, and provide insights into market sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

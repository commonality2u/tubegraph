A common question in [[investment_strategies_for_wealth_creation | wealth creation]] is whether to prefer a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) or a lumpsum [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Both approaches are important for [[strategies_for_building_a_large_financial_corpus | wealth building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Understanding SIP and Lumpsum Investments

### Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)
A SIP is a proven and effective system for [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> that ensures continuity in [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It helps smooth out the cost of acquisition and removes the need to time the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. SIP [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> provides stability for [[investment_strategies_for_wealth_creation | wealth creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Lumpsum Investment
A lumpsum [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> is more tactical, considering market fluctuations, short-term declines, sudden movements in risk-reward equations, and market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Lumpsum [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> acts as an "energy booster" for [[investment_strategies_for_wealth_creation | wealth creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Case for a Combined Approach
Both SIP and lumpsum [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> are necessary for effective [[strategies_for_building_a_large_financial_corpus | wealth building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. While there is much theory supporting the SIP plus lumpsum approach for [[strategies_for_building_a_large_financial_corpus | wealth building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, detailed data and action plans were not readily available prior to this study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The inspiration for this video came from a tweet by Pankaj which labeled an SIP plus lumpsum strategy as a powerful combination for [[strategies_for_building_a_large_financial_corpus | wealth building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This assertion pointed to a tactical "buying the dip" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Simulation Methodology and Findings

To study the combined strategy, Nifty50 data from January 2007 to December 2023 was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Base SIP Scenario
A monthly SIP of Rs 10,000 over 17 years would result in a total [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> of just over 20 lakhs, building a corpus of 61.4 lakhs at an 11.8% CAGR (excluding dividends) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This 11.8% serves as the base scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Lumpsum Triggers and Outcomes

For the study, two assumptions were made for lumpsum triggers:
1.  Only Nifty50 closing values were considered, ignoring intra-month volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
2.  A correction was defined as happening over the next month's closing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

#### 5% Monthly Dip
In the last 17 years, there were only 20 instances where the Nifty50 dropped by 5% or more over a single month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Six of these occurred in 2008, with the last being in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

*   **Result:** Investing an additional lumpsum of Rs 50,000 during each of these 20 occasions (totaling 10 lakh rupees) increased the total [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> to Rs 30.04 lakhs and the corpus to over 1 crore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Surprise:** Despite adding lumpsum money during corrections, the annualized return remained at 11.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This unexpected outcome, where even a significant lump sum didn't drastically change the XIRR, is attributed to the low weight of earlier values in the discounting function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This suggests that a 5% monthly dip strategy is not very practical due to infrequent opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

#### 15% Dip from All-Time High
Increasing the dip percentage to 15% (a "correction" level) from the all-time high yielded even fewer opportunities. The last 10 years presented only six [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> opportunities: two months in 2016 and four months in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This high percentage trigger was deemed ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

#### 2% Monthly Dip
A smaller 2% monthly correction offered many more [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | opportunities to invest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

*   **Recent Years (2021-2023):** There were 12 opportunities to make additional lumpsum [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   **Result:** A monthly SIP of Rs 10,000 combined with an additional Rs 50,000 lumpsum [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> in these 12 months showed a definite improvement. The annualized return jumped from 14.9% (SIP only) to 16.4% (SIP + lumpsum), an incremental 1.5% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Flat Market Period (Jan 2018 - Dec 2019):** Applying the same logic during a generally flat market period also showed a 1.5% differential, indicating that an SIP + lumpsum strategy has more potential than an SIP-only approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Practical Implementation Considerations

Simulations often make assumptions that are not practical in real-world scenarios. For example, assuming an unlimited supply of lumpsum money is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Limitations Imposed in Study
To make the simulation more realistic, a second layer of limitation was added:
*   Only Rs 1 lakh of lumpsum money was assumed to be available each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   An investor could invest only Rs 50,000 in each half of the year, on the first available lumpsum opportunity (e.g., a 2% dip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. If an opportunity arises but the half-year quota is met, the [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> cannot be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. If no opportunity arises, the Rs 50,000 remains unutilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

*   **Result (Limited Lumpsum):** Over a three-year period with this condition, it was possible to deploy Rs 50,000 lumpsum in each of the six half-years, resulting in an annualized return of 15.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Overall:** An SIP plus lumpsum strategy can improve the [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> to [[investment_strategies_for_wealth_creation | wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> ratio over a 17-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

There are hundreds of ways a lumpsum strategy can be customized, such as carrying forward amounts, breaking it into quarterly chunks, or using different dip percentages (3%, 4%, 6%), or varying the frequency of observation (weekly, fortnightly, daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Recommended Steps for Implementation

To implement an SIP plus lumpsum method:

1.  **Set up SIPs:** Preferably on the first day or first week of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Divide Lumpsum:** Split your available lumpsum money into two or more chunks (e.g., Rs 50,000 for each half of the year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
3.  **Define Conditions:** Establish clear conditions for deploying the lumpsum. This could be a 2% or 5% dip, or based on moving averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
4.  **Set Alerts:** Utilize alerts available on screening portals and brokerage platforms to notify you of trigger points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
5.  **Implement:** Execute the SIP plus lumpsum method on the respective trigger dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

Simulating this strategy on a worksheet can provide a deeper understanding and help in customizing the approach to see its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

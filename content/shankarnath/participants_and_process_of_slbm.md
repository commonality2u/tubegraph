The [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | Stock Lending and Borrowing Mechanism (SLBM)]] is a method allowing stock owners to earn additional income by lending their shares for a fee, similar to renting out a property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This mechanism involves the temporary transfer of securities from a lender to a borrower for a specified duration and a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. While globally popular, [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] has been present in India for over 10 years, legally approved since its creation as the Securities Lending Scheme in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

[[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] improves market liquidity, facilitates efficient short selling (aiding price discovery), helps traders manage risk through hedging, and allows lenders to earn relatively risk-free returns on their idle stock assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Participants in SLBM

There are three primary participants in any [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] process:

*   **Lender** The individual or entity who owns the shares in their demat account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Lenders can be insurance companies, banks, fund houses, high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), or retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Borrower** The individual or entity who temporarily needs to use the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Borrowers can include short sellers, banks, fund houses, HNIs, or retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Borrowers typically seek opportunities like short selling, stock price arbitrage, or covering short positions to avoid settlement failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Exchange / Clearing Corporation** The entity responsible for ensuring the transaction occurs properly and within established rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. In India, this is facilitated by the National Securities Clearing Corporation of India (a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSE) or the BSE-owned Indian Clearing Corporation Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The Clearing Corporation acts as a guarantor to the transaction by requiring the borrower to post a margin of 125% of the value of the borrowed stocks, thus protecting the lender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### The SLBM Process

A typical [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] process involves several steps:

1.  **Registration** Both the lender and the borrower register with the exchange, typically through their stock brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  **Agreement of Terms** The borrower and lender mutually agree on the loan terms, including tenure, interest rate, and other conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
3.  **Collateral Placement** The borrower places a collateral for the stocks, facilitated by the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
4.  **Share Transfer** The agreed number of shares are transferred from the lender's demat account to the borrower's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
5.  **Return of Stocks and Fee Payment** At the stipulated date, as per the contract terms, the borrower returns the stocks and pays the agreed-upon fee to the lender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
6.  **Fee Distribution** From the fee paid by the borrower, the intermediary takes their brokerage, the exchange earns a portion, and the remaining amount is credited to the lender's bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Features of SLBM Contracts

*   **Tenure** [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] contracts can range from one month to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Eligible Stocks** Over 600 stocks qualify under the [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] framework, including many A-group stocks. This list is updated monthly on the NSE website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Expiry** [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] contracts expire on the first Thursday of every month, unlike F&O contracts which expire on the last Thursday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Liquidity is generally highest in the most recent one or two-month contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Minimum Order Value** Requirements vary by brokerage. Zerodha, for example, requires a minimum order value of ₹1 lakh per security for lenders and at least 500 shares for borrowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Other brokers like Motilal Oswal Securities and HDFC Securities have no such limitations on minimum lending quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Corporate Actions and SLBM

Lenders remain the owners of the shares during the lending period and are entitled to corporate actions such as dividends, bonuses, and stock splits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

*   **Bonus Issue, Rights Issue, and Buyback** Open [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] positions are foreclosed, and the exchange handles the return of shares and pro-rata application of lending fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Dividends** The exchange recovers the dividend money from the borrower and transfers it to the lender's savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Stock Split** The exchange adjusts the quantity and transfers the new shares to the lender's demat account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

### Early Closure Options

*   **Repay Option (Borrower)** A borrower can return shares earlier than the settlement period. If the offer matches a pending order, a repay order is executed, shares are returned, and the exchange reverses the margin amount to the borrower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Recall Option (Lender)** A lender can close the contract earlier by placing a recall order with the exchange. Once matched, the recall order is executed, and shares are returned to the lender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### SLBM Rates and Taxation

*   The rate of interest or lending fee for an [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] contract can be calculated by dividing the lending fee per share by the closing share price and annualizing it based on the contract tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. For example, a Bata India share lending at ₹8 on a closing price of ₹1756 for 30 days yields an annualized return of 5.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   Regarding [[charges_and_taxation_related_to_slbm_transactions | charges and taxation]], there are no Securities Transaction Tax (STT), SEBI turnover, stamp duty, or transaction charges on [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   The movement of shares between demat accounts in an [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] transaction is not considered a transfer or sale, so no capital gains tax is payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   The lending fee received by the lender is typically considered "income from other sources" and is added to the lender's taxable income, taxed as per their income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   Brokerage commissions on [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] vary, with Zerodha charging 20% and Kotak Securities and HDFC Securities charging 15% of the lending fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. After deducting commission and GST, the net fee is credited to the lender's account upon contract expiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   All [[stock_lending_and_borrowing_mechanism_slbm | SLBM]] transactions are typically conducted offline, requiring direct communication with a brokerage relationship manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Retail investors traditionally have limited options for fixed income, primarily consisting of [[role_of_fixed_deposits_in_portfolio_management | fixed deposits]], corporate bonds, and debt mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These instruments typically offer yields ranging from 6% to 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Historically, long-term investors benefited from indexation benefits on capital gains, which helped in achieving decent post-tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, with the removal of indexation benefits for debt investors, there has been a quest for alternatives that offer higher pre-tax yields, ideally between 10% to 12%, within acceptable [[Risk management in investing | risk]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Senior Secured Bonds: A High-Yielding Alternative

A promising alternative identified is **Senior Secured Bonds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These instruments are gaining serious consideration due to recent market developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### What is a Bond?
A bond is essentially a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. When an investor subscribes to a company's bond, they effectively become a lender to that company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Secured vs. Unsecured Bonds
Bonds are primarily classified as either secured or unsecured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Secured Bonds**: These are backed by specific collateral pledged by the issuer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This collateral can be tangible assets like property, equipment, inventory, or receivables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, or it can be based on future revenues such as toll collections or subscription money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The collateral provides an extra layer of security, as in the event of bankruptcy, these assets can be sold to repay bondholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Unsecured Bonds**: These rely entirely on the issuer's promise to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Understanding "Senior" in Bonds
The term "senior" refers to the repayment hierarchy in the event of a company's bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Not all stakeholders have equal rights to liquidation proceeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The repayment order typically is:
1.  Government dues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
2.  Secured lenders (including senior bond holders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
3.  Unpaid employee salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
4.  Unsecured creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
5.  Equity shareholders (who rarely receive anything) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>

Within secured lenders, senior bond holders receive higher priority, meaning their claims are settled first, offering an added layer of protection and a greater chance of recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Benefits of Senior Secured Bonds
A senior secured bond offers two additional layers of protection compared to an unsecured bond in case of default: collateral backing and higher priority in liquidation proceeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This combination significantly helps in reducing the bondholder's potential loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
Currently, senior secured bonds offer attractive yields, ranging from 11% to 12% over short tenures, despite carrying lower [[Risk management in investing | risk]] than unsecured bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Credit Ratings and Their Nuances
Credit ratings are assigned to the *issuer* of the bonds, not to individual bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This means a company might have a 'double B' rating, but its senior secured bond can behave more like a lower-risk 'A-rated' instrument due to its inherent security and seniority, even if this isn't explicitly reflected in official ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This represents a "reward risk arbitrage" that platforms aim to uncover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Online Bond Platforms (OBPs)
Online Bond Platforms (OBPs) have emerged to make high-yielding fixed-income instruments more accessible to retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) have access to various high-yielding fixed income options, such as:
*   Category 2 AIFs (historically around 10% returns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>
*   Performing Credit Funds (bonds from SMEs, 13-15% yields) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
*   Venture Debt (debt financing for startups, 16-17% yields) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
*   Special Situation Debt (targets 20-22% returns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
*   Tier 2 capital bonds, perpetual bonds, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>

These options typically require minimum investments of lakhs or even crores of rupees, limiting access for smaller retail investors due to limited awareness, information, and restricted access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. OBPs address this by offering these instruments online with much smaller ticket sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Key Features of OBPs
*   **Highly Curated Platforms**: OBPs are not traditional marketplaces where any company can list bonds. Instead, teams meticulously evaluate each bond before offering it to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Framework**: All OBPs are registered as stockbrokers within the debt segment and are subject to SEBI's regulatory framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This ensures that only listed bonds can be offered, providing an extra layer of security due to credit ratings and higher governance standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Collateral Selection**: Some platforms like Wintealth not only select the bond issuer but also cherry-pick the collateral pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. For example, they might specifically choose housing, vehicle, or gold loans from an NBFC as collateral to ensure high quality and maximize recovery in case of default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Ticket Size**: The minimum investment amount is typically 10,000 rupees, although some offerings may go up to 50,000 to 100,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This is significantly lower than the minimum face value of 10 lakhs that was common until 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Returns**: Bond yields on these platforms generally range from 10% to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. These yields depend on factors such as the issuer's type and creditworthiness, maturity period, whether the bond is secured/unsecured, senior/subordinate, type of placement (public/private), and if it's callable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Investors should always understand these details and be cautious of platforms that solely focus on returns without providing comprehensive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Regulatory Evolution
The regulatory environment for OBPs has evolved significantly to keep pace with innovation and enhance investor protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **2022**: SEBI mandated all OBPs to register as stockbrokers, increasing oversight and monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **2023**: SEBI introduced reforms including mandatory KYC for investors, grievance redressal through the SCORES platform, routing of all orders through the RFQ platform of recognized stock exchanges, and a complete ban on unlisted debt securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **2024**: SEBI slashed the minimum investment in debt securities from one lakh to 10,000 rupees to encourage retail participation in the corporate bond market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## [[Risk management in investing | Risk Management]] in Senior Secured Bonds
While senior secured bonds are riskier than [[role_of_fixed_deposits_in_portfolio_management | bank fixed deposits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, various strategies can mitigate inherent [[Risk management in investing | risks]]:

*   **Credit Risk**: This is the risk of the issuer defaulting. Mitigated by choosing bonds structured with both seniority and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate Risk**: As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This risk, often seen in debt mutual funds, can be avoided by holding bonds until maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Risk**: The risk of not finding a buyer when needed. While platforms generally assist investors in liquidating bonds, external shocks can impact liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Sector Exposure Risk**: If all issuers belong to the same sector (e.g., NBFCs), a downturn in that sector could affect multiple investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. However, even within a sector like NBFCs, issuers may have diverse businesses (e.g., MSME lending, personal loans, school loans, microfinance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### Mitigation Strategy: Diversification
A key strategy to mitigate [[Risk management in investing | risk]] is **diversification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Instead of investing a large sum into a single bond, it is advisable to spread the investment across five, six, or even ten different senior secured bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This approach not only reduces the [[Risk management in investing | risk]] of losing all capital during a default but also improves liquidity, as it's unlikely that all diversified bonds will fail to find buyers simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Growing Interest in Bond Investing
Interest in bond investing through online platforms is increasing due to a combination of heightened awareness, stronger regulations, ease of online purchasing, and lower ticket sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Some bond issues are now fully subscribed within hours, indicating strong demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Senior secured bonds appeal to investors willing to take slightly more [[Risk management in investing | risk]] than [[role_of_fixed_deposits_in_portfolio_management | FDs]] in exchange for higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Investors can consider increasing their allocation to this asset class, either by adding fresh money or reallocating funds from [[short_term_investment_options | short duration mutual funds]], to continually improve their [[Risk management in investing | risk]]-return profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

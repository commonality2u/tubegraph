The [[Financial Independence and Early Retirement FIRE Method | FIRE]] (Financial Independence, Retire Early) strategy encompasses three core principles, and one of the most crucial is "spend wisely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, rather than merely not spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This principle emphasizes identifying essential expenses versus discretionary ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The goal is to be rational about expenditures, not necessarily "stinky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

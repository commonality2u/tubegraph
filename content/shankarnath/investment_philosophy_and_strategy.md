Porinju Veliyath, often referred to as the "small cap Zar," is an investor who has experienced significant ups and downs in his three-decade career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. His [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investment patterns and strategies]] and philosophy have evolved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Background and Early Career

Born in 1962 in Chalakkudy, Thrissur District, Kerala, Porinju Veliyath came from a lower middle-class family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He began working at the age of 16 to support his studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. After graduating from Government Law College, Ernakulam, he worked in a telephone exchange earning 2,500 rupees a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

In 1990, without immediate gainful employment, he moved to Bombay (Mumbai) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He started as a floor trader at Kotak Securities, where he was known as Francis due to the difficulty people had remembering his name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. After four years, he moved to Parikh Securities as a research analyst and fund manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. At the turn of the millennium, he returned to Kochi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

In 2002, in Kochi, he founded Equity Intelligence, a portfolio management firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Core Investment Philosophy

Equity Intelligence's website states, "All sensible investing is value investing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Porinju Veliyath's [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investment and portfolio growth strategies]] can be summarized into four strong pillars:

1.  **Value Investing**
    He focuses on finding companies with a high margin of safety, primarily within small and micro-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. He believes growth is imperative for smaller companies, making it easier to pick stocks with deep value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Examples of his multi-bagger picks include Hindware Homes, Tata LXE, CDSL, Raymond, and West Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

2.  **Contrarian Investing**
    Porinju favors companies that have potential but are currently out of market favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. His approach is often unconventional, not always based on financial ratios or business cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. He invests in illiquid stocks and does not set market cap limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. He has stated that if a company is performing well with good future prospects, ethics and corporate governance should not hinder investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

3.  **Investing in Lesser-Known Companies**
    Many of his successes stem from investing in high-quality, lesser-known businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. He prefers these opportunities over "great companies with clean balance sheets, honest management, and clear business visibility," asserting that such popular investments might yield returns comparable to bank FDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. He points to picks like Gokul Das Exports and Nika Paper Mills, which he invested in before they became widely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

4.  **Diversified Portfolio**
    Porinju strongly advocates for a diversified portfolio to reduce risk without significantly impacting returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He allocates some capital to large-cap blue-chip companies, though not a significant portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He does not have a preference for any particular sector or type of company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation strategy]] highlights that there is no single formula for investment success, and one should find a strategy that works best for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Portfolio Analysis

A deep dive into Porinju Veliyath's current portfolio (where he holds 1% or more shareholding) reveals:

*   **Micro Caps:** All 16 companies are micro caps with a market capitalization of 2,000 crores or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Growth:** Revenue growth shows no consistent trend, which is typical for micro caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Volatility in selection is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Out-of-Favor Stocks:** Many of his holdings have underperformed the small-cap index over the last three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Lesser-Known:** None of the companies are mainstream, and most have less than 1,000 crores in annual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** The portfolio is diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Quality:** From a Return on Capital (ROC) perspective, the businesses are not always considered high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

Porinju's selection process does not conform to many conventional [[investment_strategies_for_wealth_creation | investment strategies for wealth creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. He is described as a "classical value oriented stock picker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Examples of Stock Picks

*   **RPSG Ventures Limited:** Porinju holds approximately 32 crores in this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. RPSG is an operating holding company with interests in IT, FMCG, health and wellness, real estate, and sports (including ownership of the IPL team Lucknow Super Giants and ATK Mohun Bagan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Standard metrics like P/E ratio or sales growth may not accurately evaluate such a complex entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

*   **Singer India:** Despite negative sales growth, a P/E ratio of 330, and four consecutive quarters of negative operating profits, Porinju acquired a 1% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This was likely a turnaround play, banking on the recent change in management with Mr. Rajesh Kanna, who has experience in the consumer and white goods industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. He anticipates significant upside if the turnaround is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

*   **PG Foils:** Porinju recently picked up a 1% stake in this aluminum foil and packaging company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The company faced challenges like reduced demand for aluminum and operating losses due to rupee depreciation, leading to a significant fall in share price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. However, Porinju's potential rationale (conjecture) might be its low Enterprise Value (EV) of 88 crores, given its market cap of 229 crores and substantial cash reserves of 149 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This suggests a classic value play based on intrinsic asset value, akin to Benjamin Graham's principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

Porinju's stock picks are not easily replicable from a stock screener due to the distinct variables at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## Performance and Learnings from Mistakes

Equity Intelligence, being focused on small and micro caps, has experienced cyclical performance with both good and bad periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The period of 2018-2019 was particularly tough when many small and mid-cap companies' valuations normalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. After five straight years of 18%+ performance up to 2017, the subsequent two years saw significant normalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. An investor who put money in his fund at the end of FY 2018 would have barely recovered their capital by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Porinju has acknowledged his mistakes, stating that in 2018, he "got carried away" and paid a "heavy price" for making highly concentrated bets in "not so proven companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

One notable stock-specific mistake was with Leel Electricals in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Porinju aggressively bought the stock, holding a massive 8% of its equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. The company sold its consumer durable business for 1,600 crores, but the promoters allegedly diverted the funds to their personal companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Porinju took this up with SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India), which ordered a forensic audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. He reportedly lost about 70% in this transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Evolution of his Investment Approach

Through these experiences, particularly Leel Electricals and the 2017-2019 market period, Porinju Veliyath has refined his [[investment_strategies_and_principles_of_ashish_kacholia | investment strategies and principles]]. His current approach includes:

*   **Avoiding Very Small and Illiquid Companies:** He now avoids these types of companies in his PMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Including Larger Businesses:** His portfolio now includes larger businesses like Tata Communications, Raymond, and Hindware, which constitute 50% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Expansion:** He advises investors to visualize a company's growth runway over the next 5 to 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Continuous Risk Analysis:** He recommends regularly assessing risk by keeping an eye on valuations, market sentiments, and future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Watchful of Promoters' Behavior:** He is now more cautious about how promoters treat minority shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Caution Against Bulk Deals:** He advises against buying stocks solely because a big investor made a bulk deal, as retail investors don't know the original purchase price or prior holdings of the big investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Systematic Knowledge Upgrade:** He warns that casual investing will not work indefinitely and encourages everyday investors to systematically upgrade and update their knowledge and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

For 2025, a key development focus is the creation of a small case or a series of small cases, a feature frequently requested by viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This initiative is being pursued with increased confidence, partly due to an improving personal [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | investing approach]] and the ongoing application process for a Research Analyst (RA) license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Small Case Offerings

There are multiple options being considered for these small cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>:

1.  **Actively Managed Small Case**
    This option would largely mirror the creator's personal investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

2.  **Cloning Strategy Small Cases**
    This involves creating a series of small cases based on [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing strategies]] that have already been learned and applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Examples of these strategies include:
    *   Magic Formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>
    *   Shameless Cloning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
    *   Trending Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
    *   Losers Portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
    *   G Peter Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>
    *   100 Baggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
    *   Monopoly Stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>

### Supporting Initiatives

The creator's newsletter, which launched in 2024 and has nearly 50,000 subscribers, predominantly covers [[small_cap_and_micro_cap_strategies | small and micro cap companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Specific companies mentioned include Sky BLS, Zaggle, Deep Industries, Garware Hi-tech, Kilburn, and Harom Pipe Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This focus on [[investing_strategies_in_sme_stocks | SME stocks]] aligns with potential small case offerings.

## Future Plans and Challenges

These small case initiatives, along with a planned paid community platform, represent significant steps that will demand considerable effort and financial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Updates on both the community and small cases will be shared regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

While there is no formal definition for microcap companies, they are generally considered a subset of [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small-cap companies]], typically ranked beyond the top 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. In India, this often refers to companies with a current market capitalization below 6400 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Despite their size, some microcap companies can be industry leaders, such as Borosil Renewables (solar glass), Quest Corp (India's largest private sector employer), and SIS (security industry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Investing in [[understanding_microcap_stocks | microcap stocks]] can potentially generate excess returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Characteristics of Microcap Investing

Understanding the specific [[characteristics_of_microcap_investing | characteristics of microcap investing]] is crucial:

*   **Under the Radar**: Microcap stocks often fly "under the radar" of research analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A Motilal Oswal study found that 40% of companies in the Nifty Microcap 250 index receive no analyst coverage, and only 12% have five or more analysts tracking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This "blind spot" can provide opportunities for retail investors to find undervalued stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **High Insider Ownership**: Approximately half of the companies in the Microcap 250 index have promoter holdings over 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The presence of a progressive and ethical owner-operator is a positive sign for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Low Free Float**: Generally, these businesses have very little free float, which can make it challenging for anyone to acquire a significant stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Liquidity and Volatility**:
    *   **Concerns**: Microcaps often have low trading volumes, potentially making it difficult to enter or exit positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Bid-ask spreads might be wider, increasing transaction costs, and a lack of liquidity can lead to higher volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Opportunities**: Illiquidity can also be a driver for "multibagger" returns, as many microcap stocks are inefficiently priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, and there is less competition from institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Over 18 years, the Nifty Microcap 250 achieved a CAGR of 16.5% on a rolling return basis, closely trailing broader indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Volatility is high in the short term but stabilizes over longer periods (14-15% range) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Microcaps perform best when markets are rising rapidly (e.g., 2007, 2014-15, 2017, 2020-21) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> and worst when markets are falling (e.g., 2008, 2011, 2018-19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. High volatility is essentially the price paid for better potential performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Other Factors**: Microcaps generally offer lower dividend payouts and less transparency, with potential risks like promoter fraud, price manipulation, and pump-and-dump schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. However, the appeal lies in the chance to pick a future HDFC Bank or Reliance Industries early on, potentially multiplying wealth thousands of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

It is suggested to view microcaps as part of an entire portfolio, determining the ideal allocation based on individual risk profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Investment Options for Microcaps

There are several ways to [[small_cap_and_micro_cap_strategies | invest in microcap companies]]:

### Passive Management

*   **Mutual Funds/Index Funds**: A recent development is the introduction of microcap index funds, such as the AMC Microcap 250 Index Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This fund invests in a basket of 250 stocks, covering companies with a market cap of 1,000 to 10,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. It is passively managed, replicates the Nifty Microcap 250 TRI, is well-diversified across sectors, and has shown strong historical performance with high volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. More AMCs are expected to launch similar funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. A 5-10% exposure to microcaps within a larger wealth-building portfolio can be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Active Management

Given the pricing discrepancies, lack of liquidity, and valuation gaps in microcaps, there is a strong case for actively managed products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

*   **Portfolio Management Services (PMS)**: Several PMS offerings focus specifically on microcaps, including:
    *   Central Microcap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
    *   Equitas India Opportunities Portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
    *   Pipe Strategy by ICICI Prudential PMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>
    *   Small and Microcap Portfolio by SageOne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
    The minimum ticket size for most PMS offerings is typically 50 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Smallcase**: A more affordable alternative to PMS, smallcases offer curated portfolios. Examples include offerings by Quantas, Hidden Gems by Ceteris, a smallcase by Omkara Capital, and another Hidden Gems by Summit Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Before investing, it's essential to research the products, their construction, fund manager, fee structure, and redemption rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Approach

For those who prefer to manage their own investments, specific techniques can be employed to uncover hidden gems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

#### [[selection_criteria_for_microcap_companies | Selection Criteria for Microcap Companies]]

Drawing insights from full-time microcap investor Ian Castle, here are seven essential selection criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>:

1.  **Market Leader**: The company should be a leader in its market (e.g., Tata Coffee, Borosil, Sagachi Industries, HPL Power Systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
2.  **Intelligent and Iconoclastic Management**: Run by individuals with exceptional insight and independent thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
3.  **Sustainable Profitability**: The company must be profitable and able to self-fund its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
4.  **Low or No Debt**: A strong financial position with minimal leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
5.  **Clean Capital Structure**: Low amounts of warrants and options as a percentage of outstanding shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
6.  **Low Institutional Ownership**: This suggests less scrutiny from large investors, potentially leading to undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
7.  **Grossly Undervalued**: The stock should trade at a significant discount (e.g., 50-60%) to its intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

#### Hard Metrics for Screening

To filter through thousands of microcaps, specific quantifiable metrics can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>:

*   **Market Cap**: Limit selection to companies with a market cap of at least 500 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Promoter Shareholding**: Ideally, promoter shareholding should be at least 50% to indicate owner-operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Revenue and Profit Growth**: Look for at least 15% growth in sales and 20% growth in profit annually for the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Leverage**: Debt as a percentage of equity should be low, perhaps 20% or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)**: Aim for ROCE of 20% or higher, indicating effective capital utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Relative Valuation**: The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio should be lower than the industry's average P/E multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Applying these screening criteria can significantly narrow down the universe of potential investments. For example, a screen that started with 900 companies might yield just 21 microcaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Further analysis involves examining the last three years' annual reports, earnings transcripts, news, and equity analyst reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## [[behavioral_aspects_of_microcap_investing | Behavioral Aspects of Microcap Investing]]

Beyond the technical analysis, personal investing behavior is equally vital when dealing with microcaps:

*   **Patience**: Microcap [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | investing]] requires significant patience, as it can take years for the share price to reflect the company's true worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Discipline and Selectivity**: Be picky and disciplined in selecting microcap stocks, having the ability to say "no" to many opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Staggered Investment**: Do not buy everything at once. Ian Castle suggests investing one-third of capital after due diligence, the second third after meeting management, and the final third after management has executed at least 25% of their promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. This means averaging up as conviction grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Differentiate Business vs. Stock Performance**: Understand that business performance (e.g., EPS doubling) might not immediately reflect in stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Under-valuation due to this divergence can be a good time to invest, assuming no fundamental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Margin of Safety (Growth Potential)**: For microcaps, the margin of safety comes from the company's growth potential. Seek businesses that can grow profits by 300-500% over the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

Investing in microcaps goes beyond screeners and requires time to evaluate management, business models, and growth runways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Forums like Valuepickr or Reddit can be sources for investment ideas and theses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Fund managers in developed markets are also utilizing more advanced metrics and factor-based approaches (value, momentum, earnings) for [[tactical_approaches_to_maximize_small_cap_investment_performance | tactical approaches to maximize small cap investment performance]] and [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | microcap selection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

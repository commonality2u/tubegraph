Investing trends indicate a significant shift from actively managed schemes to passive ones, with a clear rise in inquiries and investments in index funds and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A notable change within index investing is the move from largely [[market_capitalization_based_index_funds | market cap based investing]] to a [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | factor-based one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The [[Smart Beta ETF Strategies | smart beta]] category in India has seen its Assets Under Management (AUM) rise to approximately 22,000 crores, a number that is rapidly growing with new funds launched almost monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The focus of this investment approach is not only to potentially generate better returns but also to enhance diversification and mitigate portfolio risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Understanding Smart Beta Indices

[[Smart Beta ETF Strategies | Smart beta]] refers to a passively managed investment strategy that combines specific characteristics or "factors" such as value, size, volatility, momentum, and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. While this discussion will focus on five primary factors, there are over 100 factors available for consideration, including standard variables like profitability and sales growth, and even unconventional ones like sentiment analysis, cybersecurity, human capital, and social media influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These factors serve as alternatives to the conventional method of selecting stocks based purely on market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Niftyindexes.com lists nearly 40 different strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, not every strategy has a corresponding index fund or ETF available for investment. The investable universe of smart beta ETFs is currently around 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. A few key fund houses participating in the smart beta category include HDFC, Motilal Oswal, ICICI Prudential (which has the most ETFs in this space), Mirae Asset, and Kotak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Primary Smart Beta Factors and Opportunities

### Alpha

Alpha, more formally known as Jensen's measure, was developed by economist Michael Jensen in the late 1960s to evaluate mutual fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Simply put, alpha calculates the difference between a stock's performance and market returns; a higher alpha value indicates better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

**Available Indices/ETFs:**
*   **Nifty50 Alpha ETF:** Comprises 50 stocks with high alpha over the past year, selected passively from the top 300 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Nifty 200 Alpha 30 Fund:** Selects 30 stocks from the Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 ETF:** India's first multi-factor ETF, launched by ICICI Prudential in 2020. It combines alpha and low volatility to offer both growth and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

**Performance and Investment Strategy:**
*   Single-factor alpha indexes have shown exceptional performance, often beating broader indexes like the Nifty 200 and Nifty 500 by 10% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   Jensen's alpha can perform exceptionally well in certain years (e.g., 2007, 2015, 2017, 2021, 2023, H1 2024), but also experience significantly bad years (e.g., 2008, 2016, 2018, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   There appears to be a mean reversion pattern: a good year for the Alpha 50 index is often followed by a disappointing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Tactical Play:** Invest in the Alpha 50 after a bad year and consider exiting after a prosperous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For example, 2024 might not be the ideal time for a lump sum investment due to its massive run-up since early 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Play:** A 20%+ compounding rate in the long run makes alpha factor indices suitable for Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   The Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index offers above-average performance with stronger downside protection, delivering similar returns to Alpha 50 but with lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Low Volatility

Contrary to the common belief that higher risk yields higher returns, low volatility strategies can offer competitive returns. The Nifty 100 Low Volatility 30 ETF has outperformed the Nifty 100 on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This phenomenon gained popularity after the 2008 global financial crisis, as investors sought defensive, less volatile stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

**Investment Strategy:**
*   Low volatility indices tend to perform well in bear markets, as seen during the 2008-2011 period when safety and valuations were prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Opting for a low volatility large-cap index can provide better performance and lower risk compared to the Nifty50 or Nifty 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   For predominantly large-cap investors, this factor is a significant consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   Low volatility is currently the single largest category among strategy-based ETFs and index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Value

The value factor is based on the premise that companies with lower valuations tend to generate higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Value is determined using various metrics such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, Price-to-Sales, and dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Value indices often act as an antithesis to growth-oriented factors like alpha and momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

**Available Indices/ETFs:**
*   **S&P BSE Value Index:** Combines book value, price, earnings, and sales to assign a value score to stocks in the BSE large midcap index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Nifty50 Value 20 Index:** Ranks companies based on Return on Capital Employed, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

**Performance and Investment Strategy:**
*   The Nifty50 Value 20 index has generally outperformed its market-cap-based counterpart in most years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   However, the performance differences have often been small (2-4%), though these small increments add up over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   Value tends to outperform when the market is recovering from a bear phase, as observed in 2009 (post-2008 crisis), 2017 (post-2016), and 2021 and 2023 (as equities recovered from bear phases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   The period from 2008 onwards, characterized by high liquidity, low interest rates, and the rise of tech companies, has generally favored growth stocks over value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. However, market cycles turn, often for periods of 7 to 8 years, indicating potential future opportunities for value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### Momentum

The momentum factor suggests that stocks that have performed well relative to their peers in the past will continue to do so in the future, and vice versa. In essence, "winners keep winning and losers keep losing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

**Available Indices/ETFs:**
*   **Nifty 200 Momentum 30:** A popular scheme, along with mid-cap, small-cap, and multi-factor variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

**Performance and Investment Strategy:**
*   Momentum indices have significantly outperformed their market-cap-weighted counterparts in both the short and long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   The momentum strategy performs exceptionally well when stock markets are rapidly rising (e.g., 2007, 2009, 2014, 2017, 2021, 2023, H1 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   Conversely, momentum shows weakness during bear markets (e.g., 2008, 2011, 2018, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Tactical Play:** It's potentially a bad time for momentum when 10-year government bond yields are rising, but a definite play when yields are falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Play:** Momentum can also be applied over the long term, for example, through SIPs and tactical lump-sum investments using ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### Quality

The concept of quality in stocks lacks a universal consensus, but it generally refers to companies that are highly profitable, possess strong balance sheets, and have minimal or no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

**Available Indices/ETFs:**
*   Good number of ETF options, including quality variants around the Midcap 150, Nifty 100, and Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

**Performance and Investment Strategy:**
*   The Nifty 200 Quality 30 has performed neck-and-neck with the Nifty 200 on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   However, the Midcap 150 Quality 50 index has surprisingly underperformed its market-cap-based counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   Historically, there hasn't been a significant difference in returns for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   While expert opinion suggests quality offers good downside protection and outperforms in bear markets, concrete evidence for this has not been clearly observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Investors are encouraged to review the raw data available on niftyindexes.com to draw their own conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## Overall Performance and Investment Considerations

[[Advantages of Smart Beta Funds | Smart beta indices]] generally tend to outperform [[market_capitalization_based_index_funds | market cap based indexes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. When comparing various factors:

*   **Nifty50:** This broad market index has held first place only once in 2019 and frequently ranks in the lower half of performance tables, spending almost 70% of years at ranks four, five, or six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. It often delivers average or below-average returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Quality Factor:** This factor is somewhat suspect, spending two-thirds of its time in the lower half of rankings with performance similar to the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Low Volatility Factor:** A "middlesome" factor, but it has surprisingly achieved more top rankings (rank one) than momentum. Its suitability for conservative profiles seeking stability makes it a valuable addition to a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
    *   For a conservative risk profile seeking stable growth, the low volatility factor is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. It offers better-than-market-cap returns and significantly lower standard deviation (risk) compared to other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
    *   The Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index is an excellent choice for conservative investors, providing both low volatility and slightly better performance than pure low volatility indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
    *   It also offers the best downside protection, followed by the quality factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Alpha and Momentum Factors:** These two factors have consistently performed well, spending only about a third of their time below average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Momentum has never been ranked last in 19 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
    *   Momentum offers consistency, making it a desirable permanent allocation in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
    *   Alpha and Value factors tend to exhibit extreme performance, ranking at the top in some years but also experiencing bad times in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This suggests they are better suited for tactical plays by identifying optimal entry and exit points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

In conclusion, investing in [[Smart Beta ETF Strategies | smart beta]] ETFs and funds is a smarter approach to wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Given their proven ability to deliver better returns compared to traditional market-cap-based indices, now is an opportune time to consider incorporating them into an investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Further research into asset allocation-based portfolio strategies using factors strategically and tactically promises even better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

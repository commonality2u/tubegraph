This article revisits and revises a strategy for constructing a "lifetime portfolio" using a combination of momentum and value indices. The initial concept, detailed in a previous video, suggested using these indices due to their weak correlation and significant gaps in annual performance, aiming to build a passive, stable, yet powerful long-term investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Background and Initial Strategy
The original strategy involved investing in a combination of momentum and value indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The speaker had personal investments based on this, including a Nifty 500 value 50 index SIP since December 2023, and a Nifty 200 momentum 30 fund SIP from April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Recent Performance of Momentum Funds
Initially, the [[Performance analysis of momentum indices|momentum fund]] showed strong growth, with its Net Asset Value (NAV) rising from around 10 to over 25 by September 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, it subsequently saw a significant drop, falling to 18 before recovering to around 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This represented a 28% drop in NAV from September 2024 to March 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Despite the recent decline, the NAV increased from 10 to 20 over four years, yielding 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This volatility highlights the need to revisit and revise the investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Revisions to the Strategy
To enhance the strategy, two key modifications have been implemented:
1.  **Extended Timeline**: The data analysis has been updated to include information until April 25, 2025, extending beyond the previous video's scope which ended in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
2.  **Changed Indices**: Instead of the Nifty 200 M30, the analysis now utilizes the [[Momentum and Value Index Strategy|Nifty 500 Momentum 50]] index and the [[Momentum and Value Index Strategy|Nifty 500 Value 50]] index, as these better represent the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Sourcing Index Data
To source historical index values for analysis, follow these steps:
1.  Access the website niftyindices.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "Reports" on the top navbar, then select "Historical data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  Click on the orange drop-down menu and choose "Total Returns Index value" (TRRI, which includes Price Return + Dividend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
4.  Select "Equity" from the next drop-down field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
5.  Choose the desired index and date range, then click "Submit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
6.  Download the neatly organized daily data as a CSV file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
7.  Use simple Excel formulas to extract monthly and value data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Performance Analysis
### Trailing Returns
Recent performance shows that the last six months have significantly impacted the [[Performance analysis of momentum indices|momentum trading returns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index**: Over the past 5 years (starting April 2020, during market lows due to COVID), it grew by approximately 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Over a longer 10-year period, the trailing return is about 18%, considered more realistic for a broad-based momentum index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Value Indices**: Over the long run, value indices have yielded around 15-16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Rolling Returns
On a rolling return basis, [[Performance analysis of momentum indices|momentum indices]] have generally outperformed value indices over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Despite this, it's crucial to remember that every investment strategy (growth, value, momentum, low volatility, dividend) experiences periods of ups and downs, emphasizing the importance of analyzing information over extended timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## The Case for a Balanced Allocation
Given that [[Performance analysis of momentum indices|momentum]] has outperformed value over the past 10-15 years, a common question is why not allocate entirely to momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. While a 50/50 split was previously proposed, investors might consider different mixes like 2/3 in momentum and 1/3 in value, or 60/40, or 75/25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

The rationale for a balanced allocation is data-driven, becoming evident when examining performance on a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### SIP Performance Over 10 Years (April 2015 - March 2025)
Consider an SIP of ₹10,000 per month started on April 1, 2015, equally split between the [[Momentum and Value Index Strategy|Nifty 500 Momentum 50]] index and the [[Momentum and Value Index Strategy|Nifty 500 Value 50]] index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Individual Performance (₹10,000/month SIP)**:
    *   [[Momentum and Value Index Strategy|Momentum]]: Annualized return of 19.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   [[Momentum and Value Index Strategy|Value]]: Annualized return of 21.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   This result (value outperforming momentum) might be surprising given their trailing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The reason is that between January 2018 and the end of 2022, the value index remained relatively static while momentum doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. During this period, monthly investments into the value index accumulated units at a low NAV. When the value index experienced a significant jump in 2023 (growing 300%), these accumulated units generated substantial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Combined 50/50 SIP (₹5,000/month in each)**: This combination yielded an annualized return of 20.6% over the past 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. While the percentage returns for standalone momentum, standalone value, and the 50/50 combination are similar, the journey significantly differs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. A 50/50 combination smooths out the investment journey, mitigating the impact of good and bad patches in either index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Weak Correlation and Gaps in Performance
The weak correlation between value and momentum is demonstrated by significant gaps in their performance during specific periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. For example, between October 2024 and April 2025, the [[Momentum and Value Index Strategy|momentum index]] was down 25%, while the [[Momentum and Value Index Strategy|value index]] was down 13-14%, showing an 11-12% difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. These periods of divergence are when SIPs are most effective, helping to grow the overall portfolio and reduce volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
1.  **Hypothesis Validation**: The core hypothesis remains valid: [[Momentum and Value Index Strategy|momentum and value indices]] are not tightly correlated, evidenced by significant performance gaps over various timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
2.  **[[Performance analysis of momentum indices|Momentum Performance]]**: Over 19 years on an average holding return basis, momentum has performed exceptionally well, with 18-19% returns and a high probability of over 15% performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
3.  **Balancing Act**: Both [[Momentum and Value Index Strategy|momentum and value indices]] offer a balancing effect, helping to reduce portfolio volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The allocation ratio (e.g., 50/50, 60/40) is left to individual investor preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
4.  **SIP Strategy**: The SIP strategy provides comfort that systematic investing is the best, safest, and most logical approach for equity investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### On Switching Strategies
Attempting to time a switch between momentum and value indices is highly confusing and generally not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The advocate for a balanced approach, such as a 50/50 mix, which can potentially yield 17-19% returns over longer periods without active intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

However, if one must intervene, consider easing up on momentum funds when their Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is high (e.g., 24 and above) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. In such cases, pausing momentum SIPs and avoiding lump-sum investments is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Existing funds could be moved into value or parked in safer options like liquid money market funds or equity savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Excessive meddling is generally not beneficial for long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The provided numbers should inspire confidence despite the recent 25-30% fall in momentum and 17% decline in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

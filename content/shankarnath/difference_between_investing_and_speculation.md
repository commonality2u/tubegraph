Benjamin Graham, author of "The Intelligent Investor," dedicates his first chapter to distinguishing between investing and speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>. This comparison is a recurring theme throughout the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:03">[02:16:03]</a> and serves as a foundational concept for [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | long-term financial success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.

## Defining Investing

Graham defines investing as an activity characterized by three key attributes:
*   **Fundamental Analysis** The activity is conducted through the fundamental analysis of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Protection Against Loss** The investor deliberately seeks to protect oneself from serious losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:15">[02:00:15]</a>, which aligns with the book's aim to teach how to [[risk_management_in_investing | minimize losses]] in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. This is further reinforced by the concept of [[risk_management_in_investing | margin of safety]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:52">[10:14:52]</a>, which is a way of [[risk_management_in_investing | reducing the risk of being wrong]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:10">[10:29:10]</a>.
*   **Adequate Returns** The investor is looking for adequate returns as opposed to extraordinary performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>. The book aims to teach how to maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

## Defining Speculation

Any operation that does not meet these three requirements was deemed by Graham as speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:03">[02:16:03]</a>. Modern-day examples of activities Graham would consider speculative include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:10">[02:19:10]</a>:
*   Cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:09">[02:23:09]</a>
*   Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>
*   GameFi tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">[02:27:06]</a>
*   Virtual real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:09">[02:28:09]</a>
*   Some AI-related investments that most people do not understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>

Graham also generally advised against active [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing strategies]] such as day trading, foreign bonds, IPOs, and growth stocks, often painting a slightly negative picture of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:02">[06:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. He suggested avoiding growth stocks because their valuations were based on future earnings, which he considered less reliable than current earnings or a company's net asset value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:05">[06:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:01">[06:25:01]</a>, particularly given the financial system's development in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:11">[06:27:11]</a>.

## Risk and Return in Value Investing

Benjamin Graham emphasizes that risk and reward are not always positively correlated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:07">[12:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:05">[12:36:05]</a>. In the context of a value portfolio, which is a core tenet of his philosophy, the greater the potential for reward, the lesser the inherent risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:06">[13:56:06]</a>. This concept is a foundational principle of value investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:03">[14:28:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

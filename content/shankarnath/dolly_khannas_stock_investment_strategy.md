Dolly Khanna is a prominent figure in the Indian stock market, known for her successful investment portfolio. While many songs celebrate personalities in music, movies, politics, and sports, some feel a particular Led Zeppelin song captures the essence of Dolly Khanna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Her publicly disclosed holdings, representing a 1% plus stake, are valued at over 350 crores, though her total corpus, including holdings under 1%, is presumably much higher, potentially reaching 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Background and Management

Dolly Khanna's investment portfolio is managed by her husband, [[rajiv_khannas_role_in_dolly_khannas_portfolio | Rajiv Khanna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Rajiv Khanna, an IIT Madras graduate from 1968, founded Quality Milk Foods in 1986, which produced the popular Quality Ice Cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He sold this business to Hindustan Lever Limited in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. With significant capital from this exit, he began investing in the stock markets in 1996 under Dolly Khanna's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This highlights that while Dolly Khanna receives the recognition, [[rajiv_khannas_role_in_dolly_khannas_portfolio | Rajiv Khanna]] is the primary strategist behind the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Interestingly, Mr. Khanna was 52 years old when he first entered the stock market, demonstrating that smart and calculative [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing]] can commence at any age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. He learned from initial mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. One of his early successes was Unitech Limited, where a ₹5 lakh investment in 2003 grew to ₹25 crores within three to four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The Khannas maintain a low public profile, avoiding interviews and media engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy

Dolly Khanna's [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investment philosophy]] centers on identifying and capitalizing on growth opportunities, particularly within the small and mid-cap sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Stock Selection Methodology
Their preference leans towards a growth style of [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. They generally avoid sectors like banking, technology, and government companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Instead, their portfolio features companies in textiles, chemicals, rubber, automotive, and manufacturing, where they often find undervaluation and mispricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

A distinctive aspect of their strategy is prioritizing companies that deal in products and services they or the public use in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Unitech:** Invested when Mr. Khanna was looking to buy a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Mjushi Technopac:** Discovered while seeking a bottle manufacturer for his food business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Hawkins Cookers:** Identified for its utility in daily cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Femare:** Investment prompted by observing his daughter using their cosmetic products, yielding a 10x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

This preference for small B2C (Business-to-Consumer) companies likely stems from Mr. Khanna's experience running his own business, Quality Foods, which honed his ability to identify quality businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Exit Strategy and Active Management
A crucial [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing trait]] for Dolly Khanna is knowing when to exit a stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. She successfully sold IT holdings before the dot-com bubble and exited Unitech prior to the global financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. She is not a "buy and hold" investor; stocks with high allocations are exited if the company's performance dips or does not meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Despite their successful exits, mistakes do occur. During COVID-19, the Khannas exited many positions, fearing lockdowns would severely damage their portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, when the scenario didn't unfold as expected, they did not act decisively to re-enter the market, resulting in missed gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Information Consumption
Their [[investing_patterns_and_links | investment strategy]] heavily relies on publicly available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Due to their private nature, they rarely meet company management, conduct scuttlebutt, or calculate intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Investment decisions are primarily based on making sense of public information, with experience and iterations helping them recognize patterns and make better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Evolving Strategies

Over time, their [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investment framework]] has incorporated newer strategies and mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Special Situation Investing
[[Strategies for investing in holding companies | Special situation investing]] is an area favored by Mr. Khanna, which can yield significant returns in a short period, despite being rare occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Beyond Buy and Hold
While not against buy and hold [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing]], Mr. Khanna views it as just one of several available techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Current Approach: The 30-Day Moving Average
Despite leaning towards fundamental analysis, Mr. Khanna recently revealed that he manages over 500 stocks in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. His current strategy involves checking the 30-day moving average (DMA) of each stock nightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Entry:** If a stock trades above its 30-day moving average, it indicates a positive breakout, prompting an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Exit:** If the stock price falls below its 30-DMA, he considers selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

This "simple filter" allows him to exit the market before a calamity and enter when a breakout begins, indicating a shift towards a more technical, price-movement based approach rather than purely fundamental analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Replicating Dolly Khanna's Portfolio: An Experiment

An experiment was conducted to assess the viability of "shamelessly copying" Dolly Khanna's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Data Source
Websites like Moneycontrol and Trendlyne provide insights into major individual investors' holdings. This is possible due to a 2016 SEBI rule requiring companies to disclose shareholders holding more than 1% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Holdings below 1% are not disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The study focused on 37 companies where Dolly Khanna previously held or continues to hold over a 1% shareholding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Methodology
1.  **Data Collection:** Manual calculation of shares and quarterly share prices for the 37 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
2.  **Starting Point (T0):** June 2021 was assumed as the initial acquisition month for shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. For example, her 2.1% holding in Deepak Spinners (1.46 lakh shares) in June 2021, at the then-share price, amounted to an acquisition cost of over ₹3 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The total acquisition cost for all 1%+ companies as of June 2021 was ₹319 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
3.  **Tracking Increments/Decrements:** Positive and negative changes in share numbers were mapped. For instance, Dolly Khanna's Deepak Spinners holdings decreased from 1.46 lakh to 1.11 lakh shares by September 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. These shares, acquired at ₹207, were sold at ₹268, yielding a profit of nearly ₹94 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Results and Caveats
Over eight quarters (June 2021 to June 2023), the XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return) of this replicated portfolio was a "placid" 6.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The small-cap index was largely flat during most of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

It's important to note the significant assumptions and limitations of this study:
*   Dividends were ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   Taxation was not accounted for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   Large assumptions were made regarding share acquisition and cost of investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   Only 1%+ holdings were analyzed; the Khannas have invested in over 500 companies in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

*   **[[Investment Strategies for Multibagger Stocks | Multibagger]] Focus:** A strong emphasis on finding [[Investment Strategies for Multibagger Stocks | multibagger]] opportunities rather than tracking index or diversified mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Small and Micro Cap Space:** They believe the most significant opportunities lie in the small and micro-cap segments, which constitute the bulk of their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

*   **Active Portfolio Management:** Dolly Khanna regularly reviews and adjusts her portfolio based on changing market conditions and new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** The Khannas consistently refine their investment approach by incorporating new filters, such as the daily moving average and focusing on [[strategies_for_investing_in_holding_companies | special situations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

The fact that [[rajiv_khannas_role_in_dolly_khannas_portfolio | Rajiv Khanna]] began investing at 52 years old serves as an inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

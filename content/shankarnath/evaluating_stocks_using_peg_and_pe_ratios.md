Many investors aim to model their portfolios after successful managers like Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Peter Lynch's investing strategy, detailed in his books *One Up on Wall Street* and *Beating the Street*, can be broken down into three parts: a compelling story, portfolio construction, and ideal stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This article focuses on two key [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metrics]] central to his stock selection criteria: the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio and the Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio.

## Understanding the PE Ratio

The [[understanding_pe_ratios | Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio]] is an important [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation metric]] in stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Peter Lynch emphasized that this metric should not be looked at in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Instead, he preferred to study it over several years and compare it with the industry average to assess if a company is truly undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

To apply Peter Lynch's approach, two filters related to the [[relative_valuation_and_price_earning_multiples | price earning multiples]] are used:
1.  The company's current [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] should be lower than its own five-year average [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
2.  The company's current [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] should be lower than the industry's average [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Application in Stock Screening
When applying these [[factors_affecting_pe_ratios | PE ratio filters]] after an initial market capitalization filter, a universe of 1040 small-cap companies (in the Indian context, between 500 and 15,000 crores) was reduced to 234 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Understanding the PEG Ratio

The fourth significant [[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | selection criteria]] in Peter Lynch's method is the [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PE to earnings growth ratio]], commonly known as the [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### How the PEG Ratio Works
The [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratio]] allows for a more meaningful comparison of companies across different industries, unlike the [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

For example:
*   **Infosys Limited:** With a current [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] of 28.6 and an average earnings growth of 10%, its [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratio]] is approximately 2.9 (28.6 / 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Ultratech Cement:** Its [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratio]] is 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Hindustan Unilever (HUL):** Its [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratio]] is 4.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Peter Lynch would not approve of [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratios]] like 2.9, 2.5, or 4.7 for his stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. He stated that "the [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE ratio]] of any company that's fairly priced will be equal to its growth rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This means companies with a [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratio]] of less than one are generally considered undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Dividend-Adjusted PEG Ratio (Peggy)
Peter Lynch also used a slightly modified version called the dividend-adjusted [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratio]], or Peggy for short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Similar to the [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratio]], companies with a Peggy of less than one are flagged as undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Application in Stock Screening
A conservative Peggy ratio of 0.75 was used in a [[stock_screening_platforms_and_financial_metrics | stock screener]], which further reduced the list of potential companies from 125 to 102 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Conclusion on Ratio Application

While [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | valuation metrics]] like [[understanding_pe_ratios | PE]] and [[understanding_and_applying_the_peg_ratio_and_capital_employed_turnover_ratio | PEG ratios]] are powerful tools, Peter Lynch's strategy emphasizes that investors should not rely solely on screening processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. After narrowing down a list of companies, significant hands-on research and fundamental analysis of each company's strengths, financials, market share, business risk, and competition are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. His approach is practical and can be adapted by investors seeking fast-growing companies available at reasonable valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

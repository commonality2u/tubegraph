The success of the [[coffee_can_investing_strategy_explained | coffee can investing program]] largely depends on the quality of stocks placed inside the "coffee can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. This strategy hinges on finding high-quality stocks and holding them for long periods, typically outperforming benchmarks across economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.

## Origins of the Quality Business Concept
The phrase "coffee can" dates back to the old West in the early 19th century, when people would store valuables like money and jewelry in coffee cans under their mattresses for safekeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. The investment version of this concept was accidentally discovered by [[origins_and_history_of_coffee_can_investing_by_robert_g_kirby | Robert G Kirby]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, who first wrote about it in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Kirby's discovery came from analyzing a deceased client's portfolio, where he found the client had consistently invested in all recommended stocks but ignored sell recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This accidental patience, characterized by putting away share certificates and forgetting about them, led to a massive fortune over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This interaction revealed the importance of "multibaggers"â€”stocks that appreciate capital multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. For example, a small investment in Xerox changed his client's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Even one 100-bagger can profoundly impact portfolio returns, even if other stocks fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## Identifying a High-Quality Business
Functionally, [[identifying_high_growth_potential_companies | identifying high-quality businesses]] for coffee can investing involves looking at four major characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>:

1.  **Business Longevity**
    *   A company must have been operational for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
2.  **Revenue Growth**
    *   Companies should have grown revenue by at least 10% *every year* over the last decade (not just a 10-year CAGR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. This means a minimum 10% growth in year one, year two, and so on, up to the tenth year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
3.  **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)**
    *   This metric measures how efficiently a business uses its equity and debt to generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
    *   The [[value_of_high_return_on_capital_and_low_cost_of_capital | coffee can framework]] considers an ROCE of 15% to be an ideal characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
4.  **Market Capitalization**
    *   As per [[origins_and_history_of_coffee_can_investing_by_robert_g_kirby | Robert Kirby's]] original work, only companies with a market cap of at least 100 crores (in an Indian context) are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. While this includes over 2,200 companies, a coffee can portfolio doesn't typically have many [[characteristics_of_microcap_investing | microcap companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

## Additional Filters and Considerations
Investment firms often apply additional filters beyond Kirby's original criteria to refine their selections, such as:
*   A steady positive free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>
*   High market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>
*   Low debt-to-equity ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>

Individual investors, like Gurjot Ahluwalia, also recommend further filtering:
*   Applying filters for 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year sales growth of at least 10% to weed out cyclical companies with sharp peaks and troughs in growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.
*   Filtering out cyclical, commodity-based sectors (e.g., steel, sugar, metals, infrastructure, power, real estate) and PSU businesses or sectors with high regulatory control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.
*   Looking for low debt (e.g., less than 1 debt-to-equity ratio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.
*   Preferring companies with at least 40-50% promoter holding to ensure "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.
*   Researching corporate governance track records, including any SEBI violations, fines, or criminal cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Application
While these characteristics define high-quality businesses, applying some of these filters can be challenging for the average investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. For instance, manually checking 10 years of year-on-year revenue growth is laborious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. Platforms like Screener.in offer user-generated filters that can approximate the criteria, but may not precisely check year-on-year growth for all 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

[[challenges_in_investing_with_coffee_can_strategy | The initial research and analysis]] required to ensure the right stocks are chosen is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. However, this rigorous selection process aims to identify businesses that offer the highest probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Professional Services
For investors lacking time or inclination, [[professional_portfolio_management_services_offering_coffee_can_investment_strategies | Portfolio Management Services (PMS) companies]] like Ambit and Marcellus offer portfolios based on the coffee can approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Marcellus, led by [[challenges_and_considerations_in_implementing_a_coffee_can_investment_strategy | Saurabh Mukherjee]], offers a "Consistent Compounders portfolio" which heavily borrows from the coffee can approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. These services often apply their own proprietary filters and forensic accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. However, they typically require a minimum investment of at least 50 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

[[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | Factor investing]] or [[Smart Beta ETF Strategies | Smart Beta Funds]] can be considered an evolution of traditional index investing, offering significant long-term returns through small adjustments to investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These adjustments can potentially lead to an annual increase of five, six, eight, or even ten percent in returns compared to indices like the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## What is a Factor?
A "factor" is a specific characteristic or attribute found to influence the performance and returns of a stock or portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While historically, indices were based on the relative size or [[market_capitalization_based_index_funds | market capitalization]] of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>, improved computing power has led to the emergence of many more factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42">[01:42]</a>. Examples include:
*   Profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51">[01:51]</a>
*   Sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51">[01:51]</a>
*   Sentiment analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56">[01:56]</a>
*   Human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58">[01:58]</a>
*   Cyber security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58">[01:58]</a>
*   Social influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01">[02:01]</a>

Factors are often a package of attributes rather than isolated characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04">[02:04]</a>. For instance, the "value factor" identifies companies with a market price per share lower than their intrinsic value, using variables like P/E ratio, P/B ratio, price-to-sales, dividend yield, and buyback history to calculate a value score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11">[02:11]</a>.

## Key Advantages of Smart Beta Funds
[[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | Smart Beta Funds]] offer several significant advantages over traditional active funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58">[02:58]</a>:

*   **Passive Investing Style** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02">[03:02]</a>: They adopt a passive approach to investing.
*   **Transparent Rules-Based Methodology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05">[03:05]</a>: Their investment strategy follows clear, defined rules.
*   **Broadly Diversified Portfolio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08">[03:08]</a>: They typically maintain a diversified portfolio of assets.
*   **Lower Expense Ratio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11">[03:11]</a>: Compared to active funds, they generally have lower operating costs.
*   **Potential for Higher Returns**:
    *   The Nifty 50 Value 20 index has significantly outperformed the Nifty 50 TRI over the past five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48">[04:48]</a>, achieving massive gains in years like 2020 and 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09">[05:09]</a>.
    *   Momentum strategies have performed slightly better than [[market_capitalization_based_index_funds | market-cap-weighted]] Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03">[06:03]</a> and excel during rising stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14">[06:14]</a>.
    *   Historically, [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | factor investing]] has demonstrated the ability to deliver up to 10% higher returns compared to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Lower Volatility**: The value 20 index has achieved its outperformance at a lower level of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57">[04:57]</a>. Similarly, low-volatility indices have maintained lower volatility than the Nifty 50 while offering comparable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19">[08:19]</a>. This means investors can achieve Nifty 50-like returns with less risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33">[08:33]</a>.

## Common Factors in Detail

### Value Factor
The value factor is based on the premise that companies with low valuations tend to generate higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[03:42]</a>. A classic definition of a value company involves selecting the top 30% of stocks with the highest Book Value to [[market_capitalization_based_index_funds | market cap]] ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>.

In the Indian market, two prominent value factor-based indices are:
*   **S&P BSE Value Index**: Uses a combination of Book Value, Price Earnings (P/E), and Sales to derive a value score applied to the BSE Large Midcap Index, resulting in a 30-stock value-based index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[04:11]</a>.
*   **Nifty 50 Value 20 Fund**: Ranks and weights companies based on Return on Capital Employed (RoCE), P/E ratio, Price to Book (P/B) ratio, and dividend yield, seeking companies with high RoCE, low P/E and P/B, and high dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>.

### Momentum Factor
The momentum factor posits that stocks that have performed well recently will continue to do so in the near future, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17">[05:17]</a>. This approach requires constant rebalancing of stocks over short periods (three, four, or six months) to capture upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35">[05:35]</a>.

Indian momentum-based funds include:
*   Nifty 200 Momentum 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49">[05:49]</a>
*   Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51">[05:51]</a>

### Quality Factor
While there's no universal consensus on its definition, a quality company is generally characterized by high profitability, a strong balance sheet, and low or no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27">[06:27]</a>.

The S&P BSE Quality Index uses three metrics to determine a quality score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42">[06:42]</a>:
*   **Return on Equity (RoE)**: Higher RoE is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50">[06:50]</a>.
*   **Balance Sheet Accruals Ratio**: Based on net operating assets, a low number is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55">[06:55]</a>.
*   **Financial Leverage Ratio**: Calculated by dividing book value by total debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01">[07:01]</a>.

The Nifty also offers various quality index options, including variations for the Midcap 150, Nifty 100, and Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07">[07:07]</a>.

### Low Volatility Factor
Contrary to the common belief that higher risk equates to higher returns, studies show that low-risk portfolios can outperform high-risk ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40">[07:40]</a>. This approach gained popularity after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, as investors sought defensive, less volatile stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58">[07:58]</a>. Volatility is typically measured as the standard deviation of a stock's daily price returns over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08">[08:08]</a>.

## Investing in Smart Beta Funds
[[Investment Opportunities in Smart Beta Indices | Investing in Smart Beta Funds]] is becoming increasingly accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52">[11:52]</a>:

1.  **Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)**: As of a recent count, there are 18 factor-based mutual fund schemes and 22 [[Benefits and Drawbacks of ETFs | Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)]], a number that is consistently growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59">[11:59]</a>.
2.  **Investment Platforms**: Platforms like Smallcase offer numerous factor-based strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14">[12:14]</a>, including momentum, quality, value, and multi-factor strategies from various providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23">[12:23]</a>.
3.  **Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Strategy**: For those with time and inclination, it's possible to create a personal factor-based model by understanding the index creation methodologies of Nifty indices and S&P Global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48">[12:48]</a>.

## Considerations
*   **Factor Rotation**: Factors rotate over time, meaning no single factor is a guaranteed way to create wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31">[13:31]</a>.
*   **Lump Sum Investments**: While Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are generally recommended, lump sum investments can be considered to exploit the right factor at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42">[13:42]</a>.
*   **Predicting Market Movements**: Although challenging, information like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, liquidity, volumes, and expert opinions can help in understanding market conditions to choose appropriate factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32">[09:32]</a>.

[[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | Smart Beta strategies]] are seen as a primary passive investing vehicle and the future of index investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23">[10:23]</a>, with the potential to significantly improve portfolio returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22">[11:22]</a>.

The [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]], conceptualized by [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Mohnish Pabrai]], is an investment strategy derived from an article he co-wrote for Forbes in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It outlines a strategy of cloning what other great investors are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This [[performance_of_copycat_investing_strategy | copycat portfolio]] yielded an annualized return of 15.5% over a 17-year period, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 4.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] consists of 15 stocks, with five stocks in each of three distinct categories: Spawners, Shameless Cloners, and Uber Cannibals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. While the specific portfolio constituents change annually, the underlying methodology reflects [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Mohnish Pabrai]]'s value-oriented investing principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

For those interested in building an Indian equivalent of this portfolio, it is recommended to equal-weight the chosen stocks, meaning an equal amount of capital is invested into each stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Spawners

Spawners are companies that inherently possess an incubation capability, enabling them to allocate capital, infrastructure, personnel, and project plans to launch new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. These new ventures have the potential to grow into multi-billion dollar enterprises independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Typically, spawners utilize a "cash cow" business to aggressively reinvest profits into other, potentially unrelated, businesses that can drive future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Indian Spawner Candidates

Several Indian companies fit the Spawner definition:
*   **Reliance Industries** Its core petrochemical, refining, oil, and gas operations serve as a cash cow, which the company has leveraged to build substantial businesses in diverse areas like telecommunications, retail, media, and digital healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Adani Group** This conglomerate has interests spanning ports, power, airports, and renewable energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **State Bank of India (SBI)** Beyond its major stakes in related subsidiaries, SBI has incubated its digital banking platform, YONO, valued at $40-50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Info Edge India** Described as India's "digital Berkshire Hathaway," this company aligns with the spawner characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **IndiaMart** Has been actively acquiring various businesses recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Indian Energy Exchange Limited (IEX)** Has spawned IGX (Indian Gas Exchange), which is anticipated to have an IPO in the next two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Shameless Cloners

The Shameless Cloners category involves replicating the high-conviction investments of seasoned value-oriented investors who have decades of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In the US, this is often done by examining 13F filings, which disclose quarterly holdings of large investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Identifying Indian Shameless Cloners

For the Indian market, one approach is to access "Superstar shareholder portfolios" on platforms like trendline.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. These platforms provide lists of prominent Indian investors and their recent stock purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Once a list of 15-20 potential recommendations is compiled, a randomized selection of stocks is suggested to minimize personal biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Uber Cannibals

Uber Cannibals are companies that consistently buy back their own shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Such companies typically possess substantial cash reserves, anticipate minimal competition or disruption to their business model, and believe their stock is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Share buybacks can increase an investor's stake in the company without additional capital outlay and boost earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Indian Uber Cannibal Candidates

Indian companies known for consistent share buybacks include:
*   **Balrampur Chini Mills** Has conducted six buybacks since 2017, averaging one per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Wipro Limited** Executed buybacks in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. IT service companies frequently engage in buybacks to deploy large cash reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** Conducted buybacks in 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2022, with large amounts like ₹18,000 crores in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Infosys** Bought back over 6 crore shares at ₹9,300 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Aarti Drugs** Has performed buybacks four times in 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Jagran Prakashan Limited** Has been consistently active with buybacks in 2013, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

Other companies to consider for consistent buybacks include Nalco, Kaveri Seed, E-Clerx Services, and Quick Heal Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Considerations for an Active Portfolio

While the three categories of the [[mohnish_pabrais_free_lunch_portfolio | Free Lunch Portfolio]] each present a compelling investment narrative, it's important to remember that this is an active, [[simplifying_investment_portfolios | stock picking portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. To enhance stock selection, it is beneficial to integrate learnings from other investing strategies, such as identifying coffee can stocks, monopolies, using the [[implementation_of_magic_formula_in_indian_stock_market | magic formula]], focusing on cash-rich companies, and performing sector analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. These additional criteria can help in identifying a strong set of stocks for an opportunity portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

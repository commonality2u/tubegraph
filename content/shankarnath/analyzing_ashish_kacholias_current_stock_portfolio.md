While maintaining a low public profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, an examination of his publicly disclosed holdings offers valuable [[lessons_and_insights_from_ashish_kacholias_investment_approach | insights into his investment approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Overview

As of September 2024, Ashish Kacholia's publicly disclosed portfolio includes 38 companies where he holds more than a 1% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:41">[09:39:41]</a>. It is estimated that he holds a significantly higher number of stocks, potentially 80-100, including unlisted companies and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. A striking feature of his current portfolio is its predominant focus on micro-cap companies, with an average market capitalization of approximately 2,000 crore rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:05">[10:02:05]</a>. Many of these companies, such as Beta Drugs, Inframe Appliances, Amtron, Knowledge Marine, Vasa, and Denticity, are listed on the SME exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

## Sectoral Preferences

While his portfolio appears somewhat dispersed, Kacholia demonstrates a clear preference for specific sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>:
*   Chemical businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>
*   Material companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>
*   Small tech players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>
*   Manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>
*   Infrastructure companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>

Notably, his portfolio contains very few financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>, with only one, SG Finserve (focused on supply chain financing), currently listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Data from the past decade suggests that BFSI companies are generally outside his [[asset_allocation_for_indian_stocks | circle of competence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

## Financial Characteristics

Kacholia's portfolio companies are not typically considered "cheap" by classical value investors when examining their P/E multiples or price-to-book ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. A majority of the companies exhibit a P/E ratio of 50 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

However, he compensates for this with a strong focus on sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. The average company in his portfolio clocks an annual sales growth of at least 20% over both short and long terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. This focus on growth is further evidenced by EPS numbers, with half of his portfolio companies growing their EPS annually by at least 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. This approach aims to align stock price performance with EPS changes over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. His investment style is described as a blend of value and growth, often termed GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.

## Investment Principles Evident in his Portfolio

Analysis of Kacholia's portfolio reveals several core principles:

*   **Businesses with a Moat**: He seeks companies with a "moat" â€“ a sustainable competitive advantage that makes them not easily replaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This can include unique technology, geographical dominance, strong branding, market leadership, or participation in sunrise sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. Examples from his portfolio include Megathm Induction Limited and Amtron Electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
*   **Demonstration Effect**: Kacholia values businesses that show a "demonstration effect," meaning their products or systems can be replicated across multiple clients, leading to economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. His investment in Majesco Limited and Fable Fintech, which serves nine out of ten of India's largest private banks for money transfer software, exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   **Undervalued Businesses**: His [[investment_strategies_and_principles_of_ashish_kacholia | investing strategy]] borrows inspiration from Warren Buffett, seeking undervalued businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Many companies in his portfolio, such as E2E Networks, SG Finserve, XPro, Beta Drugs, Phenotex Chemicals, Phase 3, and Safari Industries, have become multi-baggers for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Simple Businesses**: He invests in companies that are highly focused and excel in one or two areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. Such companies are often found in the small and mid-cap space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   **High-Quality Management**: A critical aspect of his [[investment_strategies_and_principles_of_ashish_kacholia | strategy]] is an insistence on high-quality [[management_analysis_for_stock_investment | management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. He prioritizes leaders with a proven track record of integrity, performance, and execution ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   **Flexible Holding Periods**: While he might aim for long-term investments, his average holding period is about 2.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. He is not hesitant to exit companies if they do not perform as expected or if the execution does not meet his thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This flexibility allows him to identify and stick to potential long-term multi-baggers for his core portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Unlike investors who concentrate heavily on a few stocks, Kacholia prefers to diversify his investments across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>, which is particularly important given the volatility of small and micro-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.

## Theoretical Performance and Lessons Learned

A theoretical [[performance_analysis_in_indian_stock_market | analysis]] of "shamelessly cloning" Kacholia's trades over the last three years (October 2021 to November 2024), by investing 10,000 rupees in each of 69 identified stocks when he first entered and selling when he exited or holding until November 15th, 2024, suggests an annualized return of 25.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

However, this analysis comes with several assumptions and disclaimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. The true value lies not in precise numbers, but in the [[lessons_and_insights_from_ashish_kacholias_investment_approach | lessons uncovered]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>:
*   **Flexibility**: Kacholia's willingness to move in and out of companies or reduce holdings if execution falters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.
*   **Mistakes are Part of the Process**: Approximately 25% of the 69 companies analyzed were either exited at a loss or are still held at an unrealized loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. This highlights that even successful investors make mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.

The key takeaway is not to directly copy his portfolio but to understand and replicate his underlying [[investment_strategies_and_principles_of_ashish_kacholia | principles]] to refine and improve one's own [[methods_for_analyzing_and_managing_stock_portfolios | investment approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Ashish Kacholia's success is attributed to discipline, strategy, and a relentless focus on fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>. His portfolio analysis underscores the importance of thorough research, having a clear sectoral blueprint, investing in businesses with competitive advantages, prioritizing consistent growth, and maintaining flexibility and diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. His portfolio and [[investment_strategies_and_principles_of_ashish_kacholia | investing style]] can serve as a guide for investors, rather than a strict playbook for direct copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

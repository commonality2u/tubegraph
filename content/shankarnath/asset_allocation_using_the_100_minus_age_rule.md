From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

The 100 Minus Age Rule is a widely recognized thumb rule often referenced by financial advisors for [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. It provides a simple guideline for determining how much of an individual's wealth should be invested in riskier assets, such as equities, versus safer fixed-income instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## How it Works
To apply the 100 Minus Age Rule, subtract your current age from 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The resulting number represents the percentage of your wealth that should be allocated to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The remaining percentage would then be allocated to debt instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

For example, if an individual is 43 years old, the calculation would be 100 - 43 = 57. This suggests that 57% of their investable wealth should be in equities, with the remaining 43% in debt instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Benefits
The 100 Minus Age Rule is a well-intentioned and straightforward starting point for individuals who have not previously considered [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Its simplicity allows for faster calculations and quick decision-making in personal finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Shortcomings
While useful, the 100 Minus Age Rule has several limitations:
*   **Ignores Financial Goals** The rule does not account for different types of financial goals and their respective timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. For instance, a retirement goal 20 years away might require a different [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] mix than a short-term goal, such as starting a business in three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Neglects Other Variables** It overlooks crucial personal financial variables including:
    *   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>
    *   Existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>
    *   Inheritance amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>
    *   Liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>
*   **One-Size-Fits-All Approach** The rule places all individuals of the same age into an identical risk category, which is often not practical given diverse financial situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

Investors are encouraged to perform additional analysis beyond this rule to create a more personalized and effective [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Further exploration into [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | effective asset allocation and portfolio management]] is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

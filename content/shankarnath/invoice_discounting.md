Invoice discounting is a financial arrangement where a vendor sells its receivables (invoices) to a bank or Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) at a discount to receive upfront cash [00:14:14]. This practice helps vendors manage their cash flows during the typical 90-day time lag between supplying goods or services and getting paid for them [00:14:04]. The concept itself has been in use for many years [00:14:21].

## How it Works

Platforms like Credits, Giraffe, and TradeCred have [[short_term_investment_options | fractionalized]] this opportunity, allowing retail investors to participate with investments as low as 50,000 rupees [00:14:26].

Here is an example of the process:
1.  A company, Calpro, sells goods to a client and expects payment within 49 days [00:14:37].
2.  Calpro, needing immediate funds, approaches a platform like Giraffe [00:14:44].
3.  Giraffe lists this opportunity on its website, detailing the deal size, minimum investment, expected Internal Rate of Return (IRR), settlement date, and other supporting information [00:14:46].
4.  Investors provide funds, and the platform facilitates the transaction, allowing Calpro to receive upfront cash.

## Returns and Tenures

Invoice discounting typically offers investors a pre-tax Internal Rate of Return (IRR) ranging from 11% to 13% [00:15:04]. For instance, a specific case mentioned offered an IRR of 11.49% [00:14:59]. The tenures for these investments usually range from 30 to 90 days [00:15:07].

## Risks

Several risks are associated with invoice discounting:

*   **Credit Risk:** The primary risk lies with the credibility, capacity, and intention of the entity responsible for making the payment (the client of the original vendor) [00:15:13]. If this company fails to pay, delays payment, or if there are delivery issues or legal troubles, it can severely impact the investor's returns and even the recovery of the principal [00:15:24].
    *   **Mitigation Efforts by Platforms:** Platforms attempt to mitigate this risk by verifying the authenticity of the invoice, assessing the payment history of the paying entity, authenticating the delivery of the product or service, and sometimes seeking post-dated checks or personal guarantees from the promoter [00:15:36].
*   **Unsecured Nature:** Unlike [[asset_leasing | asset leasing]] or secured bonds, invoice discounting is almost always an unsecured investment [00:16:01].
*   **Liquidity Risk:** There is no secondary market for invoice discounting, which means investors might face challenges if they need to exit their investment before the tenure ends [00:16:09].

Despite these concerns, the returns from invoice discounting are considered promising, and the [[short_term_investment_options | short-term investment]] tenure is an advantage [00:16:17].

The stock market frequently experiences periods of high costs and [[investing_during_market_volatility | volatility]], leading to indecision among investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This indecisiveness stems from factors such as high [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | valuation]] for many stocks and an increased volatility factor, as observed in recent times due to global events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. When markets are on a high, investors often find "nothing to buy" because stock prices are volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Consequences of Market Volatility

During periods of high volatility, investors may not actively [[investing_during_market_volatility | invest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Instead, their money might be stashed in bank savings accounts or they might have redeemed profitable stocks, anticipating a [[impact_of_market_corrections_on_investment_strategy | correction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. These unutilized funds often sit idle in trading accounts as available margin, yielding no returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While keeping money in a savings account offers some return (typically 3-4%), it can be inconvenient for quick transfers to a trading account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Liquid ETFs as a Solution for Idle Funds

To address the challenge of idle funds during volatile market conditions, Liquid ETFs are presented as a practical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These instruments primarily invest in securities with a one-day maturity, such as tri-party repos, repos, government securities, and other overnight securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Understanding Repurchase Agreements (Repos)

A repurchase agreement (repo) is a financial arrangement where an institution (e.g., a bank) sells government securities to another institution (e.g., another bank or mutual fund) with an agreement to repurchase them after a specified period, typically one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This mechanism allows financial institutions to secure short-term loans to balance their assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. For the institution needing cash, it sells securities; for the buyer (lender), it purchases securities with an agreement to sell them back, earning interest in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This one-day duration makes the transaction very safe for all parties, including investors, and generates income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Benefits of Liquid ETFs

Liquid ETFs, composed almost entirely of repo instruments, serve as a super safe alternative for parking money due to their high liquidity and ease of trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. They function like cash while offering potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Key benefits include:
*   **Managing Transition between Equity and Cash**: Liquid ETFs help manage the transition between equity and cash smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. For example, if stocks are sold, the proceeds can immediately be invested in liquid ETFs instead of lying idle, earning returns until a new stock purchase is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This keeps cash working even during short-term inactivity between trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Low Risk**: They carry potentially lower [[risk_management_in_investing | risk]] as most assets are invested in safe instruments like tri-party repos and government securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The riskometer classifies them under low risk, with relatively low credit and interest rate risk compared to other debt products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **High Liquidity**: ETF units are traded on the stock exchange, allowing for quick conversion to cash when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Nifty 1-day rate liquid ETFs have transparent structures, with daily disclosure of portfolio holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **No Securities Transaction Tax (STT)**: This enhances their attractiveness for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Growth Option**: Interest earned can be reinvested, allowing the Net Asset Value (NAV) to grow over time and resulting in higher after-tax returns, as taxes apply only upon sale of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Collateral for Margin Trading**: ETF units can be pledged as collateral for margin trading with a low haircut (around 5%), meaning 95% of the pledged value can be used as margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Nifty 1-Day Rate Index

The Nifty 1-day rate index serves as the benchmark for all liquid ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. It represents the overnight interest rate at which Indian banks lend to each other for a single day, based on the overnight call money rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The index calculates a weighted average of these rates based on actual market transactions, published on the Clearing Corporation of India's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

Historically, the Nifty 1-day rate index has delivered between 5% and 6% on a trailing basis, and often around 6-6.5% annually, excluding COVID years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. From April 2014 to September 2023, there have been zero instances of this index giving a negative return on any single day, highlighting its safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Investing in Liquid ETFs

Investors can find ETFs with the suffix "Nifty one-day rate liquid ETF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. These ETFs provide a cushion against volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> and are suitable for all types of investors who need to park money at different times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Considerations for Liquid ETFs

*   **Tracking Error**: All ETFs have a tracking error, which for this relatively new category, will take time to stabilize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Expense Ratio**: Investors should be mindful of the expense ratio, as it can vary significantly between schemes (e.g., from 0.2% to 0.7%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Exit Load**: While most checked schemes have nil exit load, it's advisable for investors to verify for their specific scheme, especially since these ETFs are used for short-term parking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Minimum Investment**: These ETFs can be purchased during trading hours in lots as low as one unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Lock-in Period**: There is no lock-in period for liquid ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Taxation**: While the recent budget may not have significantly altered taxation for debt ETFs, especially for short-term parking solutions, consulting a tax adviser is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

Liquid ETFs offer investors a unique opportunity to park idle cash in a low-risk, highly liquid asset, providing flexibility and potential returns even during volatile market periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

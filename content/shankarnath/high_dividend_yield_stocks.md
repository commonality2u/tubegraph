The [[dividend_investing_strategies | dividend investing strategy]] focusing on high dividend yield involves selecting companies that pay out a significant percentage of their stock price in dividends annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:06">[04:04:06]</a>. This percentage is calculated as the dividend per share divided by the share price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

Historically, in the US until the 1940s, investors would compare a company's dividend yield to the yield of a Government Bond; if the equity yield was higher, they would purchase equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>. However, from the 1950s onwards, dividend yields began to decline, particularly in the 1980s when the SEC encouraged share repurchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>.

## Defining High Dividend Yield

A high dividend yield indicates how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:05">[04:06:05]</a>. For example, Castrol India, trading at 113 rupees, paid a dividend of 6 rupees 50 paise for FY 2023, resulting in a dividend yield of 5.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:22">[04:13:22]</a>. As of the video's recording, only 14 other Indian companies with a market cap over 10,000 crores matched or exceeded this 5.8% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

## Characteristics and Challenges of High Yield Companies

Companies with high dividend yields rely on generating consistent profits and free cash flows to support their payouts, which can be cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:03">[04:43:03]</a>. Some companies, especially in the metal, oil, and gas sectors, have reduced their dividend per share due to lower profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:22">[04:59:22]</a>. For instance, Steel Authority of India offered zero dividends in some years due to an unsound financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:40">[05:06:40]</a>. However, companies like Coal India, REC Power Finance, Oracle Financial Services, and Castrol India have been consistent dividend payers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:02">[05:13:02]</a>.

Predicting future dividend yields is difficult due to inconsistencies caused by current valuations and the economic climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. For example, a significant jump in FY 2021 dividend yields for many companies was due to depressed valuations during the coronavirus pandemic, even if dividend payouts were reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:05">[05:35:05]</a>.

## Mutual Funds and Indexes Focusing on Dividend Yield

### Dividend Yield Funds (Actively Managed)

There are mutual funds categorized as "dividend yield funds," with about nine schemes and an Asset Under Management (AUM) of almost 15,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:17">[06:06:17]</a>. Some of these funds have existed for over 10 years and have performed better than the Nifty 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

However, a closer look at the portfolios of these funds, such as those from HDFC, ICICI, and SBI, reveals that most of them invest in low-dividend yielding stocks, with barely three or four companies on their lists having a yield over three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:20">[06:30:20]</a>. HDFC's dividend yield fund's stated objective to target companies available at one or two times the 10-year G-Sec yield is often not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

### Nifty Dividend Opportunities 50 Index (Passive)

A passive alternative is the Nifty Dividend Opportunities 50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. This index:
*   Comprises 50 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:10">[07:20:10]</a>.
*   Selects from the top 300 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:44">[07:23:44]</a>.
*   Considers trading frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:50">[07:26:50]</a>.
*   Has a stock weight capping of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:38">[07:28:38]</a>.
*   Is rebalanced quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:58">[07:30:58]</a>.
*   Ranks companies by annual dividend yield for selection based on a defined methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:04">[07:33:04]</a>.

This index does include high-dividend yielding stocks, evident when compared to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. However, it shows little difference in performance or volatility compared to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

Overall, picking stocks purely based on a high dividend yield may not be the ideal approach to stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:18">[08:02:18]</a>.

## High Dividend Yield vs. Dividend Growth

High dividend yield stocks are distinct from [[dividend_growth_vs_high_dividend_yield | dividend growth]] stocks, which have the potential to increase their dividends in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. Studies indicate that [[dividend_growth_vs_high_dividend_yield | dividend growth]] stocks tend to outperform high dividend yielding stocks in various market conditions (bullish, bearish, neutral) and offer higher, less volatile returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

## The Dividend Value Trap

A key caution for high dividend yield investors is the "dividend value trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. This occurs when an investor is impressed by a high dividend yield but fails to recognize a stagnation or decline in the company's operating business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>. To avoid this, it's crucial to examine the company's [[earnings_yield_and_return_on_capital_metrics | return on capital employed]] and ensure it consistently stays above the cost of capital, for example, consistently over 14-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.

## Quality of Dividends

Not all dividends are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. The source of the dividend payment is critical:
*   **High Quality**: Dividends paid from the company's cash flow from operations indicate a healthy, self-sufficient setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.
*   **Low Quality**: If a company has to borrow or raise capital to finance dividend payments, it's not a great situation, and the payout cannot be guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>.

When researching, distinguish between high-quality and low-quality dividend payers by examining net profits, cash flow from operations, and free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.

## Combining Factors with High Dividend Yield

While a pure high dividend yield strategy may not be optimal, combining it with other factors can potentially deliver superior returns with less volatility and better [[defensive_stocks_and_portfolio_strategies | downside protection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>. Academic research shows that the plain dividend yield metric, when combined with factors like volatility, quality, momentum, and size, can potentially deliver returns exceeding a market-cap-weighted index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

In India, a paid small case strategy takes high dividend yielding stocks and applies factors such as low debt, management record, and price-to-earnings valuation multiples on top of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

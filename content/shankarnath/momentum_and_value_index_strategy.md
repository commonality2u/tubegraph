The combination of momentum and value indices can be used to construct a long-term investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach aims to create a passive, stable, and powerful portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Personal Investment Experience

The speaker has been running two Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) based on this strategy:
*   A Nifty 500 Value 50 index fund since December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   A Nifty 200 Momentum 30 fund since April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The Nifty 200 Momentum 30 fund, initially at a NAV of 10, rose to over 25 by September 2024, before dropping to 18 and then recovering to around 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This represented a 28% drop in NAV from September 2024 to March of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, but still an overall yield of 99% (from 10 to 20 NAV) over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Strategy Premise and Revisions

The original premise of this strategy is based on the observation that [[momentum_and_value_investing | momentum and value]] indices are weakly correlated and exhibit significant gaps in their annual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This supports the argument that a long-term investment in these indices can build a passive, stable, yet powerful portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Revisions made to the strategy for updated analysis include:
*   **Extended Timeline**: Data updated until April 25th of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Changed Indices**: Previously used Nifty 200 M30; now uses Nifty 500 Momentum 50 and Nifty 500 Value 50 indices, as they represent the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Data Sourcing Methodology

Index values can be sourced and extracted from `niftyindices.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
1.  Access `niftyindices.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "Reports" > "Historical Data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  Select "Total Returns Index Value" (TRRI, which is PR + dividend) from the orange drop-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
4.  Select "Equity" from the next drop-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
5.  Choose the desired index and dates, then click submit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
6.  Download the neatly organized daily data as a CSV file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
7.  Use Excel formulas to extract monthly values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

This method allows for pulling data on over 100 indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Index Performance Analysis

### [[Performance analysis of momentum indices | Momentum Index Performance]]
The Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index grew by approximately 26% over the last 5 years (since April 2020, a period which started during the COVID-19 market lows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Over longer periods, such as 10 years, its trailing return is around 18%, which is considered a more realistic and acceptable expectation for a broad-based momentum index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Value Index Performance
Over the long run, value indices have yielded approximately 15-15.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Comparison
On a rolling return basis, [[performance_analysis_of_momentum_vs_value_funds | momentum indices have generally outperformed value]] over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Why Combine Momentum and Value?

While [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum]] may seem to have performed better over the past 10-15 years, it's crucial to recognize that every investment strategy (growth, value, [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum]], low volatility, dividend) experiences ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Therefore, it's always better to analyze information over a longer time horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Instead of an "all-in" approach on one strategy, a balanced allocation is proposed. For example, a 2/3 allocation to [[construction_of_a_momentum_stocks_portfolio | momentum]] and 1/3 to value, or a 60/40, or 75/25 split can be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The reasoning for a balanced allocation is data-driven, not emotional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### SIP Basis Analysis (10-Year Example)
Consider an SIP of 10,000 rupees per month started on April 1, 2015, split between both indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Over 120 months (total investment 12 lakhs), as of March 31 of the current year:
*   **Momentum**: Accumulated 35.6 lakhs (19.9% annualized return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Value**: Accumulated 38 lakhs (21.1% annualized return), surprisingly higher than momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

This unexpected [[performance_of_alpha_momentum_low_volatility_and_value_factors | performance]] of value is attributed to monthly investments accumulating units at a low NAV during the static period of 2018-2022 for the value index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. When a significant jump occurred in 2023, these accumulated units grew by 300%, generating substantial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Benefits of a Combined SIP
A 50/50 combination (e.g., 5,000 rupees each into Nifty 500 Momentum 50 and Nifty 500 Value 50) on an SIP basis over the past 10 years has yielded an annualized return of 20.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. While the percentage returns might be similar to standalone indices, the combined approach significantly "smoothens that journey" by mitigating volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

This smoothing effect is evident in the performance gaps between the two indices. For example, between October 2024 and April 2025, the momentum index was down 25%, while the value index was down 13-14%, showing a big gap of 11-12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. These periods of divergence allow SIPs to work effectively, helping investors grow their absolute portfolio and reduce overall volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Weak Correlation**: The hypothesis that [[Momentum and value investing strategies | momentum and value]] are not tightly correlated remains valid, with clear evidence of performance gaps over specific and annual time frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Momentum Performance**: Over 19 years, momentum has performed well, with 18-19% returns and a high probability of 15%+ performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Balancing Act**: Both momentum and value indices offer a balancing effect that helps reduce portfolio volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The exact allocation ratio (e.g., 50/50, 60/40) is flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Systematic Investing**: The SIP strategy, when applied to this combination, provides comfort that systematic investing is the best, safest, and most logical way to invest in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Switch Strategy (Revisited)

The "switch strategy" involved fully exiting one index and using the proceeds to enter the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. However, trying to time a switch between [[methodology_for_identifying_undervalued_and_high_momentum_stocks | momentum and value]] is highly confusing and difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This reinforces the advocacy for a balanced approach, such as a 50/50 split, to achieve potential returns of 17-19% over longer periods without active intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Alternative Considerations for Timing
If active intervention is desired, one area to explore is to ease off on momentum funds when their Price-to-Earnings (P/E) multiple is high (e.g., 24 and above) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. In such cases:
*   Pause momentum SIPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   Avoid investing lump sums when valuations are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   Move existing funds into value or safer funds like liquid money market or equity savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Excessive meddling is generally not helpful for long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. These numbers should inspire confidence, especially after recent market declines where momentum fell 25-30% and value declined 17% over 5-6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

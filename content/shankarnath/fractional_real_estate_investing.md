[[Factors influencing real estate valuation | Fractional real estate]] is a concept where investors collaboratively own commercial property [00:02:27]. This arrangement makes every investor a fractional owner [00:02:31].

## How it Works
Platforms like Strata and PropShare facilitate [[Factors influencing real estate valuation | fractional real estate]] ownership [00:02:33]. They achieve this by:
1.  Creating a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) [00:04:39].
2.  Pooling investors' money [00:04:41].
3.  Purchasing the property under the SPV's name [00:04:43].
4.  Making each individual investor a shareholder in the SPV [00:04:46].

This process is similar to what is observed in [[reit | REITs]] [00:04:49]. After deducting costs, fees, and taxes, the platform distributes the rental income proportionally among co-owners, either as monthly interest or dividends [00:04:52]. These platforms typically charge a fee of about one percent and take a share in profits above a certain threshold [00:05:00].

## Returns
Platforms claim to offer a rental yield ranging from 8% to 10% [00:05:12]. An additional benefit is the appreciation in the property's value [00:05:17]. When combined with the rental yield, the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) can be pushed to 13% or even 15% over a five to six-year span [00:05:20].

Strata's website has stated a targeted IRR of 16% to 18% [00:05:29]. However, this figure has been subject to allegations by *The Morning Context* that the platform advertised an inflated IRR [00:05:37]. A review of Strata's investment portfolio showed rental yields between 8.5% and 10%, with a targeted IRR of around 13% [00:05:46].

The rental yield is generally known in advance, provided no adverse events occur [00:06:00]. However, capital appreciation is more variable and goes through its own cycles, influencing the final IRR [00:06:06].

## Minimum Investment
A significant barrier to investing in [[Factors influencing real estate valuation | fractional real estate]] is the ticket size, with most platforms requiring a minimum investment of ₹20 lakhs (approximately 20,00,000 Indian Rupees) [00:06:16].

## Risks and Concerns
There are three main concerns when considering [[Factors influencing real estate valuation | fractional real estate]] investments:

1.  **Regulation**: Currently, there is no specific regulatory framework for [[Factors influencing real estate valuation | fractional real estate]] ownership in the country [00:06:30]. There is also no apparent insurance policy to protect investors from issues like title fraud or SPV-related problems [00:06:38]. In this context, a [[reit | REIT]] is considered safer as it falls under the SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) umbrella [00:06:48].
2.  **Occupancy Rate**: A challenge, common to all commercial real estate investments, is ensuring a consistent occupancy rate [00:06:53]. Rental yields will not materialize if there is no tenant occupying the premises [00:06:59].
3.  **Liquidity Issue**: Unless the secondary market for [[Factors influencing real estate valuation | fractional real estate]] is sufficiently large and liquid, investors might face difficulties in securing the desired price at the time of exit [00:07:05].

## Popularity and Personal Consideration
Despite the risks, [[Factors influencing real estate valuation | fractional real estate]] is gaining popularity among High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs) [00:07:14]. Given the significant minimum investment of ₹20 lakhs for a single investment, the speaker would likely "take a rain check" on this opportunity [00:07:18].

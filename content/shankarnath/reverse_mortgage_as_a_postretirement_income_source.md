A reverse mortgage is a post-retirement financial product designed to provide senior citizens with a regular source of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. It is considered a very handy instrument to boost a senior citizen's monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

## How it Works
The process begins with the senior citizen pledging their house with a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. The house serves as collateral for the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The bank then pays a regular amount to the individual over a specified period, rather than a lump sum upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Example
Historically, the Punjab National Bank's reverse mortgage scheme offered payments of 435 rupees per month per lakh for a tenure of 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. For an appraised home value of one crore, this translated to a monthly payout of 43,500 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

### Key Features and Benefits
One of the most significant advantages of a reverse mortgage is that the borrower is generally not required to pay back the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

*   **Continued Residency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>: If the borrower outlives the loan tenure (e.g., 10 years), the bank will stop making payments, but the senior citizen can continue to reside in the property until their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Monthly Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>: Provides a steady and predictable cash flow for a number of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Tax Exemption** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>: As per recent court rulings, the monthly installments received from the bank are not treated as income and are therefore exempt from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

### Post-Borrower's Death
Upon the death of the senior citizen, two options are available for the legal heirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>:
1.  **Repay the Loan**: The legal heirs can choose to keep the house by repaying the outstanding loan amount, including interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
2.  **Bank Sale**: The bank can sell the house to recover its dues. Any remaining proceeds after the sale are then paid to the legal heirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This ensures that legal heirs are not "sandbagged" by the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

### Overall View
A reverse mortgage is an instrument that [[using_customized_financial_planning_for_retirement | should definitely be considered]] when planning post-retirement financials to boost a senior citizen's monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

Loans Against Mutual Funds (LAMF) offer a flexible alternative to traditional borrowing methods like personal loans or credit cards, especially during market downturns when liquidating investments would result in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Unlike other loan types, LAMF allows borrowers to retain their mutual fund units, paying interest only on the amount utilized, and continuing to receive any dividends or capital appreciation on the pledged funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The interest rates for LAMF are also significantly lower than those for personal loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## How Loans Against Mutual Funds Work
The general process for securing a LAMF involves three steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>:
1.  **Estimating Eligibility** [[how_to_calculate_loan_eligibility_using_mutual_funds | Calculating loan eligibility]] is based on the borrower's mutual fund corpus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
2.  **Pledging Units** The mutual fund units are pledged in favor of the loan provider, who then sets up a lien over these units in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
3.  **Loan Disbursement** The loan amount can be transferred via NEFT or made available as a credit limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The mutual fund units act as security, held by the bank or NBFC until the loan is repaid. If the borrower is unable to repay, the provider reserves the right to sell the units to recover their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Eligibility and Providers
Anyone over 18 years old with investments in mutual funds can apply for a LAMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The final disbursement is subject to terms and conditions set by the loan provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. For equity mutual funds, most providers only allow individuals to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, for [[leveraging_debt_mutual_funds_and_etfs | debt mutual funds]], lenders are more flexible, accepting units from individuals, partnerships, Hindu Undivided Families, sole proprietors, and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Many financial institutions, including popular banks like HDFC, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, and Bank of Baroda, as well as large NBFCs such as Bajaj Finance and Tata Capital, offer LAMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. However, many banks and NBFCs only accept a limited list of approved mutual fund schemes, and the loan is provided exclusively against those specific schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. For example, ICICI Bank and SBI accept schemes only registered with CAMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Each provider has its own terms and conditions and approved schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Calculating Loan Limits
The loan amount an individual is eligible for primarily depends on the type of mutual fund scheme and the lender's internal policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Typically:
*   For [[debt_mutual_funds_and_safety_considerations | debt funds]], lenders offer a loan limit of up to 80% of the Net Asset Value (NAV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   For equity funds, the limit is around 50% of the NAV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   Certain schemes, like ELSS (tax saver funds), may not be eligible for loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
Loan eligibility, both in terms of amount and percentage, can vary by provider based on their internal guidelines and pricing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Digital Platforms for LAMF Management

The traditional, offline method of applying for a LAMF can be complex and time-consuming, involving physical visits to banks, submission of KYC documents, mutual fund holding statements, signed pledge forms, and sometimes income proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This process includes document collection, verification, underwriting, and lien marking, making it inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Digital platforms offer a faster and easier way to manage LAMF. With integrations between banks, NBFCs, CAMS, KFintech, DigiLocker, and Aadhaar, the entire process—from application and lien marking to loan processing and receiving funds—is digital and can be completed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Yono: An Example of a Digital LAMF Platform
Yono, a Y Combinator-backed company, provides a 100% digital platform for LAMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Its features include:
*   **Fully Digital Process**: From eligibility checks and KYC to pledging units, disbursement, and loan management, everything is handled through the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Attractive Interest Rates**: Yono partners with major NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Tata Capital, offering competitive interest rates, currently at 10.5% p.a., which is considerably lower than personal loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Flexible Terms**: The platform has no foreclosure charges or prepayment fees, and payment terms are highly flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Overdraft/Credit Limit**: Instead of a lump sum transfer, lenders typically open a current account with an overdraft limit (for banks) or a credit limit (for NBFCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Interest is charged only on the amount withdrawn from this limit, not the entire approved limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This flexibility allows users to borrow only what they need, repaying it without penalty when funds become available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Customer Support**: Access to a helpful customer service team for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

#### Application Process on Yono
The application process on Yono is streamlined:
1.  **Check Eligibility**: Enter PAN details and OTPs to instantly view the eligible credit limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
2.  **Select Loan Amount**: Choose the desired loan limit (which can be increased later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
3.  **Scheme Selection**: The system automatically suggests schemes for lien marking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
4.  **Review Details**: Confirm loan details; a one-time processing fee (e.g., ₹1179) is typically applied only on the first transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
5.  **Document Fetching**: Documents are fetched via platforms like DigiLocker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
6.  **E-Agreement & KYC**: Complete bank and personal details, sign an e-agreement, perform e-mandate registration, and a video KYC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
The entire process can be completed in less than 24 hours, with initial withdrawals potentially taking a few hours to hit the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

#### Managing Loan Accounts on Digital Platforms
Once the loan is set up, borrowers can manage everything directly from the app, including changing credit limits, prepaying the loan (or a part of it), and withdrawing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### [[interest_rates_and_fees_associated_with_loans_against_mutual_funds | Interest Rates and Fees Associated with Loans Against Mutual Funds]]
Interest rates for LAMF generally range from 10% to 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Digital platforms like Yono offer rates around 10.5% currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Beyond a one-time processing charge on the first transaction, reputable digital platforms typically do not levy foreclosure, withdrawal, or prepayment fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. However, some lenders may apply additional charges only in specific circumstances like bounced payments or liquidation penalties, as detailed in their loan agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

### Safety and Benefits of Digital LAMF Platforms
*   **Security**: Digital LAMF platforms like Yono operate under RBI regulations, ensuring strict compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. They do not hold the pledged mutual funds; instead, the units remain with the registrars (CAMS and KFintech) where a lien is marked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Partnerships with large, compliant NBFCs further ensure data security and adherence to IT standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Continued Returns**: Pledged investments continue to accrue returns through capital appreciation and dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This is a significant [[benefits_of_loans_against_mutual_funds_compared_to_personal_loans | benefit of loans against mutual funds compared to personal loans]] or selling investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Monitoring**: Banks and NBFCs periodically review the fund value and corresponding credit limit, typically on a weekly or fortnightly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. In case of significant market crashes, borrowers might need to cover any gap between the loan amount utilized and the reduced collateral value to maintain the acceptable credit limit percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Despite being popular among High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs), [[loans_against_mutual_funds_eligibility_and_application_process | LAMF]] has not yet reached a mass retail audience, who still frequently rely on more expensive personal loans or credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. However, digital platforms are changing this by making LAMF accessible, transparent, and efficient, offering a valuable tool for managing liquidity needs at low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

The question of whether [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | SIP]] or [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum investing]] is better is frequently asked, and the answer is that both are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article explores a combined [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | SIP plus lumpsum strategy]] for wealth building, using Nifty50 data for simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## The Dual Approach: SIP and Lumpsum

An [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] (Systematic Investment Plan) is a tested and effective investment system that ensures continuity, smooths the cost of acquisition, and removes the need to worry about market timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum investment]], on the other hand, is tactical, responding to market fluctuations, short-term declines, sudden movements in risk-reward equations, and market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. In essence, [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP investing]] provides stability to wealth creation, while [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum investments]] act as "energy boosters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Both components are necessary for a comprehensive wealth-building strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Challenges in Data-Backed Analysis

Despite theoretical support for a combined [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | SIP plus lumpsum strategy]], there is a notable lack of empirical data to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Much of the existing literature focuses on [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | SIP versus lumpsum]] comparisons, which is considered a "non-comparison" by some experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The inspiration for this research came from a tweet by Pankaj, suggesting an [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | SIP plus lumpsum strategy]] as a powerful combination for wealth building, though it also lacked supporting data or a plan of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Simulation Methodology (Nifty50 Data)

For this study, Nifty50 data from January 2007 to December 2023 was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Base SIP Scenario
A simple monthly [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] of 10,000 rupees over 17 years would result in an investment of over 20 lakh rupees, building a corpus of 61.4 lakh rupees, with an annualized return (CAGR) of 11.8% (excluding dividends) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This 11.8% serves as the base scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Lumpsum Condition: 5% Monthly Correction
The initial tactical approach considered was to make a [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum investment]] every time there was a 4% or 5% correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. For simplicity, this study assumed:
1.  Only Nifty50 closing values were considered, ignoring intra-month volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
2.  The correction had to happen over the next month's closing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Over the 17-year period, there were only 20 instances where the Nifty50 index dropped by 5% or more over a single month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Six of these occurred in 2008, and the last was in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This indicates that a 5% monthly dip strategy is not very practical due to infrequent opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

If an additional [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum]] of 50,000 rupees was invested on each of these 20 occasions, the total investment would rise to 30.04 lakh rupees, and the corpus would exceed 1 crore rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. However, surprisingly, the annualized return remained at 11.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This minimal change in XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return) despite significant additional investments was unexpected and is attributed potentially to the low weight of earlier values in the discounting function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Experimenting with Different Dip Percentages

*   **15% Correction from All-Time High**: Increasing the dip percentage to 15% from an all-time high resulted in only six investment opportunities over the last 10 years (a couple in 2016 and four in 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This high percentage clearly did not yield enough opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **2% Monthly Correction**: A smaller threshold of a 2% monthly correction yielded many more opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. In 2021-2023 alone, there were 12 such opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. By investing an additional 50,000 rupees [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum]] in these 12 months, the annualized return jumped from 14.9% (for a regular [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]]) to 16.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This incremental 1.5% return demonstrates that an [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | SIP plus lumpsum strategy]] does offer benefits over an [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP-only]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The same 1.5% differential was observed in a flat market period (January 2018 - December 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Addressing Practical Limitations

The initial simulations assumed an unlimited supply of [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum]] money, which is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. For example, in 36 months (Jan 2021 - Dec 2023), 12 [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum investments]] of 50,000 rupees each (6 lakh rupees total) were simulated, while [[Systematic Investment Plans SIP overview | SIP]] investment was only 3.6 lakh rupees during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

To address this, a second limitation was introduced: only 1 lakh rupees of [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum]] money was assumed to be available per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Furthermore, to account for unknown future opportunities, a condition was added to invest only 50,000 rupees in each half of the year on the first available [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum]] opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

Applying this condition over a three-year period, it was possible to deploy the 50,000 rupees [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum]] in each of the six half-years, resulting in an annualized return of 15.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Over the entire 17-year period, an [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | SIP plus lumpsum strategy]] was shown to improve the investment-to-wealth ratio, though the XIRR number in the Excel sheet still did not fully reflect this improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## Summary and Recommended Strategy

Implementing a combined [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | SIP plus lumpsum method]] involves several steps:

1.  **Set up SIPS**: Preferably at the beginning of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
2.  **Divide Lumpsum Funds**: Split your available [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum]] money into two or more chunks, e.g., 50,000 rupees for each half of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
3.  **Define Deployment Conditions**: Establish a clear system for deploying the [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum]], such as a 2% or 5% market dip, or using moving averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
4.  **Set Up Alerts**: Use screening portals or brokerage platforms to set up alerts for your defined conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
5.  **Implement**: Execute the [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | SIP plus lumpsum method]] on the respective trigger dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

This strategy can be customized in numerous ways, such as carrying forward unused [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum]] amounts, breaking it up quarterly, or adjusting dip percentages and investment frequencies (weekly, fortnightly, daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Personal simulation on a worksheet is recommended to gain a deeper understanding and customize the approach to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## Open Questions and Further Research

The behavior of the XIRR remaining relatively flat even with significant additional [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | lumpsum]] investments is a point of continued discussion and an area where further insights are welcomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Any better methods for deploying an [[SIP vs Lumpsum Investing | SIP plus lumpsum strategy]], along with supporting data, assumptions, and limitations, are encouraged to be shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

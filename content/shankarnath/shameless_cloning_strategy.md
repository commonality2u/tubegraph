The [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | shameless cloning strategy]] is an investment approach that involves replicating the portfolios and trades of successful market investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Initially, a video discussing this strategy garnered significant attention, becoming the most viewed on the channel with over eight lakh views and generating substantial revenue and subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Business Today even featured it as an article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Original Shameless Cloning Methodology

The original [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | shameless cloning strategy]] began by identifying about 10 market investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It focused on companies where these investors held at least 1% of outstanding shares as of December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The top three to five stocks from each investor were then selected, narrowing the list to approximately 57 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The strategy simulated entry and exit points at the end of every quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Original Strategy Performance
Despite some shortcomings, the original [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | cloning strategy]] delivered an annualized return of 41.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Challenges with the Original Strategy

While 41% was a strong return, it was measured during a bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The original strategy was also considered complicated and difficult to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. A key challenge was the reliance on quarter-end disclosures, meaning information about investor trades would often be a month or two old by the time it could be processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Revised Copycat Investing Strategy

A revised [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | copycat investing strategy]] was developed with two major changes to address the previous limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### 1. Overhaul of Data Method

The revised approach now uses almost real-time data for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This means buying information is reported to the exchange on the same day or the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This real-time data is sourced from screening platforms like Ticker Tape, as well as the NSE website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Specific large volume transaction disclosures tracked include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>:
*   **Bulk Deal**: An investor buys or sells at least 0.5% of a company's total shares in a single trading session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Block Deal**: A pre-arranged trade involving at least five lakh shares or ₹10 crores worth of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Insider Trading**: Buying or selling shares based on non-public, price-sensitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **SASD Disclosure Rules**: Applicable when someone acquires 5% or more in a listed company, or crosses 25%, after which an open offer must be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### 2. Fixed Holding Periods for Exits

Instead of exiting at different points based on the investor's sales, the revised strategy adopts a "lazier approach" with fixed holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Stocks are bought when the market investor buys, but then sold after a predetermined period, which can range from a couple of months to a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This proactive selling removes the need to wait for the original investor to sell their shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Addressing Brokerage Fees

Frequent buying and selling in this strategy could lead to high brokerage fees, which reduce profits and discourage tactical moves like using stop-loss or portfolio rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. To address this, platforms like Stocks Kart offer flat, fixed subscriptions for unlimited trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Implementation Steps of the Revised Strategy

The implementation was done in two parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>:

### Part 1: Extraction and Cleanup
1.  **Identify Investors**: A list of well-known investors was identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Extract Buy Transactions**: Buy transactions (bulk deals, block deals, insider trades, SASD transactions) from April 1, 2021, to March 28, 2025, were extracted, covering four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
3.  **Filter Transactions**: Low-value transactions were removed, focusing only on buy transactions of at least ₹1 crore and upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This resulted in 93 transactions from 17 investors across 80 different stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Part 2: Analysis
This part involved examining gains and losses from the 93 transactions based on different holding periods during the four-year review period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Short-term analysis**: 3-month and 6-month holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Long-term evaluation**: 1-year and 2-year holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Performance Analysis of the Revised Strategy

The [[performance_of_copycat_investing_strategy | performance]] of the modified [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | shameless cloning strategy]] was benchmarked against the Nifty Small Cap 250 index.

*   **3-Month Holding Period**: An absolute return of 14.5% was observed for the cloned portfolio, compared to 5.3% for the Nifty Small Cap 250 index, showing a 9% differential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **6-Month Holding Period**: The modified [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | cloned portfolio]] returned over 21%, while the Nifty Small Cap 250 delivered 12% on a rolling basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **1-Year Holding Period**: The [[comparing_shameless_cloning_strategy_performance | performance gap]] significantly narrowed to just 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **2-Year Holding Period**: The difference widened to an impressive 15%, even after removing outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. However, this period coincided with bull runs (2021-2023 and 2022-2024), which may have inflated the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Long-Term Holding Scenario
A simulation was run where all 93 stocks were bought at the time of disclosure and held until March 28, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This portfolio yielded a return of 24.7%, while an equivalent investment in the Nifty Small Cap 250 index delivered 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This indicates a consistent 5-7% [[comparing_shameless_cloning_strategy_performance | outperformance]] for the [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | shameless cloning strategy]] over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Expected Outperformance and Limitations

The study suggests a realistic expected outperformance of about 5% to 7% over the benchmark index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. However, this is an observation, not a guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Seasoned investors, whom the strategy aims to clone, also make mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The success rate from the study was barely over 50%, with a third of the picks resulting in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. These are important [[challenges_and_considerations_in_cloning_portfolios | challenges and considerations]] when applying the strategy.

## Advantages of the Revised Shameless Cloning Strategy

This version of [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | shameless cloning]] is considered significantly better than its predecessor for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>:
*   **Real-time Data**: Uses almost real-time data, unlike the previous approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Broader Stock Selection**: No restriction on fresh investments or top-ups, unlike the previous 1% shareholding rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Easier Cash Flow Management**: Fixed holding periods simplify cash flow management, which was erratic before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Realistic Expectations**: Examining rolling returns across periods sets more realistic expectations for outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Future Applications

The [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | shameless cloning strategy]] can be immediately implemented and applied beyond individual investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. It can be adapted to FII (Foreign Institutional Investor) data, mutual fund activities, and even PMS (Portfolio Management Services) companies to build custom [[shameless_cloning_in_investing | copycat models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The creator is also working on a research analyst license to potentially build a model for Smallcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

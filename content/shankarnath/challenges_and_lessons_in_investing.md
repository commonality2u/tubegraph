Porinju Veliyath, a notable investor, has experienced many "ups and downs" throughout his three-decade career in the market, including successes, failures, and mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. His journey offers significant insights into the [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing]] landscape and the evolution of an investment philosophy through experience.

## Navigating Market Cycles

The period of 2018-2019 was particularly challenging for Porinju Veliyath's Portfolio Management Service (PMS), as stock prices for most mid and small-cap companies reverted from "astronomical valuations" back to their mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This highlights the inherent "cyclicity" in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Investors who put money into his fund at the end of FY 2018 would have "just about recovered their Capital," if any, rather than made profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Porinju himself admitted, "in 2018 I got carried away and I have paid a heavy price for that I had some highly concentrated beds in not so proven companies and that is why 2018 happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Learning from Specific Mistakes

### The Leel Electricals Debacle
A significant [[common_investment_mistakes | stock-specific mistake]] for Porinju was his investment in Leel Electricals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Investment** In 2017, Porinju aggressively bought the stock, eventually holding a "massive 8%" of Leel's equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Corporate Governance Issues** In the same year, the company sold its consumer durable business, but its promoters "diverted those funds to their own personal companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Investor Response** Porinju documented his distress in a letter to his clients and escalated the matter to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which ordered a forensic audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Outcome** Despite a counter-attack from Leel's promoters, Porinju reportedly lost "about 70%" in this transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Refined Approach
The experiences, particularly the Leel Electricals case and the market downturn from 2017 to 2019, helped refine Porinju Veliyath's investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The present-day Porinju is considered "a more refined version of the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

[!NOTE] Some key [[lessons_and_insights_from_ashish_kacholias_investment_approach | lessons]] and adjustments he has mentioned include:
*   **Avoiding Illiquid Companies** He now avoids "very small and illiquid companies" in his PMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on Larger Businesses** His portfolio now includes larger businesses like Tata Communications, Raymond, and Hindware, which constitute 50% of his holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Growth Runway** He advises investors to "visualize the company's growth Runway over the next 5 to 10 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Continuous [[risk_management_in_investing | Risk Analysis]]** Investors should continually perform [[risk_management_in_investing | risk analysis]] by monitoring valuations, market sentiments, and future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Promoter Behavior** He is now more vigilant about "promoter's behavior towards minority shareholders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Beware of Bulk Deals** He consistently warns against buying a stock solely because a "big investor has done a bulk deal," as retail investors often don't know the original purchase price or prior holdings of the "biggie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This helps in [[avoiding_common_investment_mistakes | avoiding common investment mistakes]].
*   **Continuous Learning** Porinju cautions everyday investors that "casual investing will not work indefinitely" and that one should "systematically upgrading and updating one's Knowledge and Skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

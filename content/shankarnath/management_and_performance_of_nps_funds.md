The National Pension System (NPS) is a voluntary defined contribution pension scheme designed to help Indian citizens accumulate money for retirement [00:01:00]. While its primary purpose is accumulation, it ultimately enables subscribers to convert their savings into a post-retirement monthly payout [00:01:18]. The management and performance of these funds are overseen by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) [00:02:47].

## Asset Classes within NPS

NPS offers subscribers four distinct asset classes for investment, catering to various risk-return profiles [00:04:11]:

*   **Class E (Equity)**: Investments in the stock markets [00:04:17].
*   **Class G (Government Securities)**: Includes bonds, T-bills, and other securities issued by the central or state government [00:04:21].
*   **Class C (Corporate Debt)**: Funds are invested in bonds issued by Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), public financial institutions, infrastructure companies, and money market instruments [00:04:33].
*   **Class A (Alternative Investment Funds)**: This class includes instruments like commercial mortgage-backed securities, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) [00:04:47].

The specific combination of these four asset classes (E, G, C, and A) significantly influences the growth of an individual's NPS corpus by the time they reach retirement age [00:05:06].

## [[investment_options_and_asset_allocation_in_nps | Investment Allocation Choices]]

NPS provides two options for subscribers to allocate their investments:

### Auto Choice (Life Cycle Based Approach)
This option is designed for investors who prefer not to make their own asset allocation decisions [00:05:34]. Funds are allocated based on a predefined methodology driven by the subscriber's age [00:05:40]. The portfolio starts with a higher equity exposure when the subscriber is young and systematically rebalances to reduce equity as they approach retirement [00:05:47].

Subscribers must choose one of three life cycle funds:
*   **Aggressive Life Cycle Fund**: Allows a maximum equity allocation of up to 75% [00:06:08]. For example, a subscriber aged 35 or younger would have 75% in equities, 10% in corporate debt, and 15% in government securities [00:06:32].
*   **Moderate Life Cycle Fund**: Equities are capped at 50% [00:06:15]. For instance, the equity component starts at 50% up to age 35 and gradually tapers down to 10% by age 55 [00:06:58].
*   **Conservative Life Cycle Fund**: Limits equity allocation to 25% [00:06:19].

The rebalancing between asset classes in the auto choice happens automatically once a year on the subscriber's date of birth [00:07:19].

### Active Choice (Self-Designed Portfolio)
This option is for NPS subscribers who wish to design their own portfolio and [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | decide their own asset allocation]] [00:07:28]. While it offers greater freedom, it comes with certain conditions:
*   The maximum permissible allocation to equities (Class E) is 75% [00:07:41].
*   Allocation to alternative investment funds (Class A) is capped at 5% [00:07:48].
*   This option is only available to Tier 1 NPS investors [00:07:51].
*   Previously, there was an age-based condition requiring subscribers over 50 to lower their equity allocation annually. This requirement has been removed, allowing investors to maintain 75% in equities until the age of 60 [00:08:07].

NPS rules allow subscribers to move between auto and active choices once per financial year [00:08:31].

## NPS Fund Performance

NPS returns are not fixed, unlike instruments such as Fixed Deposits or Provident Funds. Instead, returns are market-linked and depend on the performance of the chosen pension fund manager [00:11:34].

Based on data over different time periods:
*   **Equities (Class E)**: Averaged around 13% over a 10-year period [00:08:48]. Most NPS equity funds have a heavy large-cap bias, with about 90% of holdings in large-cap stocks [00:11:00]. However, these funds have generally underperformed the Nifty 50, though not by a significant margin [00:11:21].
*   **Government Securities (Class G) and Corporate Bonds (Class C)**: Both have returned a little over 8% over a 10-year period [00:08:53].
*   **Alternative Investment Schemes (Class A)**: Over the last five years, these schemes have clocked about 6% returns [00:09:01].

Overall, considering these numbers, it's fair to assume that NPS has delivered returns in the range of 10% to 11% for an average portfolio, even with an auto choice [00:09:10].

### Performance Observations:
*   The performance of pension funds within every category has been quite similar to one another and very close to their respective benchmarks [00:09:19]. This suggests that most pension fund managers may be playing it safe and mirroring the index [00:09:30].
*   Government securities (G-sec) funds are an exception; their higher average maturity (14-17 years compared to a general gilt fund's 8-11 years) makes direct comparison difficult [00:09:54]. LIC appears to have a strong position in this category, with Aditya Birla showing more recent success [00:10:06].
*   Corporate bond (Class C) funds have slightly outperformed the S&P BSE Corporate Bond Index [00:10:13]. This could be due to their allowance to invest in corporate debt instruments (like rupee bonds, listed debt from banks, Tier 1 bonds) with ratings of double A and above, and up to 10% in lower-rated 'A' paper, which introduces slightly higher credit risk but potentially better returns [00:10:22]. HDFC and ICICI Prudential's Class C funds have shown reasonable performance and consistency [00:10:51].
*   For equities, HDFC and Kotak Mahindra have been more consistent and better performers [00:11:09].

## Pension Fund Managers

Currently, there are 10 pension fund managers managing NPS assets, including major financial institutions like SBI, HDFC, ICICI, Axis, and life insurance-promoted managers like LIC Pension Fund and Max Life [00:12:00].

*   **Manager Selection Rules**: While subscribers can have different pension managers for their Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts, they cannot choose different fund managers for different schemes (asset classes) within the same tier [00:12:24]. A subscriber must select one pension fund manager to manage all four asset classes [00:12:47].
*   **[[evaluating_fund_managers | Evaluating Fund Managers]]**: Due to the rule requiring a single fund manager for all asset classes within a tier, the selection process necessitates looking at the overall performance of the pension fund manager on a portfolio basis, rather than individual asset class performance [00:13:06]. Given that most NPS schemes tend to deliver similar returns, whether individually or as a portfolio, the choice might not be extremely difficult [00:13:37].
*   **Changing Fund Managers**: Subscribers are allowed to change their pension fund manager once in a financial year [00:13:49].

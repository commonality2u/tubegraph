[[asset_allocation_strategies | Asset leasing]] is a contractual agreement between two parties for the use of an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:04">[07:47:04]</a>. The two parties involved are:
*   **Lessee:** The user of the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:50">[07:51:50]</a>.
*   **Lessor:** The owner of the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:55">[07:54:55]</a>.

The asset can be diverse, including buildings, cars, tractors, or other equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. The lease agreement typically extends for a specified period, during which the lessee makes regular payments to the lessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:40">[08:02:40]</a>.

## How it Works

Platforms like Grip Invest or Giraffe act as intermediaries between retail investors and companies seeking to lease assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:11">[08:08:11]</a>.

The process generally involves:
1.  A company identifies a need for assets, such as cars, preferring to lease rather than buy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:30">[08:19:30]</a>.
2.  An [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset leasing]] platform, sensing this opportunity, collects money from investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:55">[08:27:55]</a>.
3.  The platform uses the pooled investor funds to purchase the required assets from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:07">[08:31:07]</a>.
4.  These assets are then leased out to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:30">[08:34:30]</a>.
5.  The platform collects lease payments from the company and distributes this money to investors on a monthly or quarterly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:37">[08:37:37]</a>.
6.  Leases typically run for a two to three-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:57">[08:50:57]</a>.

## Returns

As per Grip Invest's website, this model can offer investors up to 21% Internal Rate of Return (IRR) on a pre-tax basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:30">[08:42:30]</a>. However, secondary research suggests yields are more commonly around the 12% mark, after deducting the platform's approximately 2% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:04">[08:57:04]</a>.

## Risks

Like any lending transaction, [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset leasing]] carries risks:
*   **Lessee Default Risk:** The risk that the lessee may not make timely payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:44">[09:07:44]</a>.
*   **Resale Value Risk:** The possibility that the resale value of the asset is insufficient to fully compensate the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:27">[09:15:27]</a>.
*   **Fraud Risk:** The potential for fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:05">[09:21:05]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Uncertainty:** The [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset leasing]] setup is not currently layered around a specific regulatory framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:44">[09:23:44]</a>.

Despite these risks, the concept of [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset leasing]] is not new; platforms are essentially expanding the investor base by fractionalizing the investment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:02">[09:28:02]</a>.

## Personal Investment Perspective

The speaker indicates they would consider dipping their toes into [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset leasing]] due to the regular stream of income and the fact that the setup is backed by a physical asset that can be liquidated if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:57">[09:37:57]</a>.

It is suggested that [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset leasing]] can be part of a [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | fixed income portfolio]] for diversification and recurring income generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:07">[16:50:07]</a>. The speaker plans to split their fixed income portfolio into a [[Core Satellite Asset Allocation Method | core]] portfolio (e.g., debt mutual funds, government bonds, PPF) and a smaller satellite "opportunity portfolio" for such alternative investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:22">[17:09:22]</a>.

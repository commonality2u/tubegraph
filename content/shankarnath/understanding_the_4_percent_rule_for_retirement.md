The 4% rule is a popular guideline used to determine a target [[determining_your_retirement_number | retirement number]] or corpus, ensuring financial resources are sufficient to stop actively working for an income and pursue desired projects or activities [00:00:43]. It offers a structured approach compared to simply "cooking up a number" based on intuition [00:01:01].

## Origin

This rule was first proposed by financial planner William Bengen [00:01:40].

## How it Works

The 4% rule suggests that if a retiree annually withdraws 4% of their retirement corpus, that "Nest Egg" would last at least 30 years, even after adjusting for [[effects_of_inflation_on_retirement_savings | inflation]] [00:01:45].

Practically, the inverse of 4% is 25 times [00:01:58]. This means that if estimated annual expenses in the first year of retirement are, for example, 10 lakhs, then a corpus of 2.5 crores should be sufficient for the retirement years [00:02:01]. For instance, if current monthly expenses are 1.5 lakhs and retirement is planned at age 50 (seven years from now) with a 7% [[effects_of_inflation_on_retirement_savings | inflation]] rate, monthly expenses at retirement would be 2.4 lakhs. Multiplied by 25 times, this suggests a targeted corpus of 7.2 crores [00:02:13].

## Advantages

A key feature of the 4% rule is that the 4% withdrawal rate is inflation-adjusted [00:02:40]. This means if the first year's expenses are, for example, 2.4 lakhs, the allowed withdrawal in the second year would be 2.4 lakhs plus an additional amount to account for [[effects_of_inflation_on_retirement_savings | inflation]], thus allowing for cost escalation [00:02:47].

## Limitations

Despite its popularity, the 4% rule has several [[limitations_of_traditional_retirement_models | limitations]]:

*   **Outdated Inflation Assumption** The model was developed around 30 years ago based on U.S. conditions, assuming an [[effects_of_inflation_on_retirement_savings | inflation]] rate of just 3% to 4% [00:02:57]. This is often inadequate for current Indian conditions [00:03:03].
*   **Rigidity and Applicability** It is not a universal rule [00:03:11]. While it works efficiently for a standard retirement scenario (people in their late 50s or 60s with settled spending), it performs less effectively for younger individuals (30s or 40s) who may prefer a more flexible lifestyle with a greater portion of expenses going towards discretionary activities like travel and dining [00:03:16]. The rule's rigidity doesn't offer the flexibility a younger person might prefer [00:03:39].
*   **Outdated Investment Assumptions** William Bengen's model assumed a 60/40 split between equities and bonds [00:03:49]. It also used then-long-term average annual returns of 10% for equities and 5.3% for bonds [00:03:57]. These return figures are generally no longer applicable in today's U.S. or Indian markets [00:04:03].
*   **Timing Issue** The success of the 4% rule can be significantly impacted by the timing of market performance, especially at the start of retirement [00:04:10]. For example, a bad start to investment returns can cause the retirement corpus to deplete much faster than anticipated, even with the same withdrawal rate [00:05:03].
*   **Exclusion of Taxes** The rule does not explicitly account for taxes, which will reduce the effective withdrawal amount [00:05:42].
*   **Economic Changes** Current economic conditions, including significant changes in interest rates and [[effects_of_inflation_on_retirement_savings | inflation]] compared to the 1990s, make the original 4% rule less suitable today [00:05:47].

## Modifications and Flexibility

Given its limitations, financial planners often recommend adding flexibility to the 4% withdrawal rate [00:06:04]. If the withdrawal rate as a percentage of the available corpus increases significantly (e.g., to 6% in the second year), it serves as a warning sign [00:06:10]. In such cases, moderating the withdrawal amount (e.g., reducing it to a lower expense amount) can extend the life of the corpus [00:06:24].

While the 4% rule is too simplistic to be rigidly followed, it can still serve as a broad [[retirement_planning_guidelines | guideline]] [00:06:48]. For more accurate and customized calculations, a detailed financial planning approach, such as using an Excel-based model that maps out future expenses and considers specific individual needs, is recommended over simplified methods or online calculators [00:07:57].

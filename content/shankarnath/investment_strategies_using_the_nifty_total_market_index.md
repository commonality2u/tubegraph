The Nifty Total Market Index provides a comprehensive view of the Indian stock market, offering a potential solution to investor confusion caused by periodic warnings about specific market segments like small and mid-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This index addresses questions regarding optimal investment timings or gaps in asset allocation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Understanding the Nifty Total Market Index

As its name suggests, the Nifty Total Market Index combines large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It is a highly popular investment approach, especially in the US, exemplified by the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX), which holds approximately 3,700 stocks and over $1.3 trillion in assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Millions of Americans invest in VTSAX, with many using it as their sole investment vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

The Nifty Total Market Index tracks 750 stocks, encompassing large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This provides a more comprehensive representation of the Indian stock market than traditional indices like the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] or Sensex 30, which primarily focus on a limited number of large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]], for instance, represents only about half of the Indian stock market's total capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. In [[comparison_of_nifty_total_market_index_and_nifty_50 | comparison to the Nifty50]], which is 100% large-caps, the Nifty Total Market Index covers around 96% of India's total stock market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

This index includes all stocks from the Nifty 500 and the [[features_of_nifty_smallcap_250_index | Nifty Microcap 250 Index]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It is calculated on a free-float market cap basis, meaning larger companies have the most significant impact on performance, but even the smallest companies (e.g., Cosmo First, Camel Fine Sciences, Zariki Sugar, with less than ₹2,000 crores in market cap) are included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The list of constituents is reviewed semi-annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Unlike the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]], which is heavily weighted towards financial services and IT, the Nifty Total Market Index is much more diversified, with companies from 22 different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This broader sectoral representation is due to the inclusion of mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## [[performance_and_benefits_of_the_nifty_total_market_index | Performance and Benefits of the Nifty Total Market Index]]

The presence of mid-cap and small-cap companies tends to boost the returns of the Nifty Total Market Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. For example, last year, it delivered 41%, primarily driven by the mid-cap and small-cap rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. On average, the index has shown at least a 0.5% higher return across various timelines (three-year, five-year, seven-year, ten-year, and fifteen-year rolling returns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. While 0.5% alpha might seem small, over a 15-year period, it can result in a 7% increase in corpus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Investing via a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) in this index has performed well; a monthly ₹10,000 SIP since January 2009 (over 15 years) would have accumulated nearly ₹1 crore at an annualized return of 14.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Directionally, the Nifty Total Market Index correlates highly with the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] (0.96 correlation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. In terms of volatility, it tends to operate at a slightly lower standard deviation compared to the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, investors should anticipate that the 30-35% allocation to mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap segments means there can be prolonged phases of both underperformance and outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Strategic Applications for Investors

The Nifty Total Market Index can be a primary investment instrument for many Indian investors looking to build wealth through equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### 1. Substituting the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] in a Portfolio

A straightforward application is to replace the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] with the Nifty Total Market Index in an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The reasons for this substitution are its simplicity, passive management, strong diversification, reduced need for detailed asset allocation adjustments, and slightly higher returns compared to the [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This index is particularly suitable for those new to mutual funds or index investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

**How to Invest:**
*   **Mutual Fund Scheme:** Invest directly in a mutual fund scheme that tracks the Nifty Total Market Index (e.g., Grow Mutual Fund currently offers one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Combined Approach:** Achieve similar results by combining a Nifty 500 index fund with a [[features_of_nifty_smallcap_250_index | Nifty Microcap 250 Index]] scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. For example, if investing ₹10,000, approximately ₹9,500 should go to the Nifty 500 and the remaining ₹500 to the [[features_of_nifty_smallcap_250_index | Nifty Microcap 250 Index]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### 2. Combining with an International Total Market Index

Another strategy is to combine the Nifty Total Market Index with its non-domestic counterpart, an international total market index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Assuming opportunities for investing abroad are available (despite RBI and SEBI restrictions), one could explore combinations with indices like the US Total Stock Market Fund of Fund or Developed World Indices Fund of Fund offered by Indian AMCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

Testing a 80/20 split (80% domestic Nifty Total Market Index, 20% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index - VTSAX) over a 17-year period showed little difference in returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. However, this India-international combination significantly reduced portfolio volatility compared to investing in a standalone index like the Nifty Total Market Index or [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This setup improves a portfolio's risk-adjusted return by reducing volatility for the same level of return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### 3. Using as a Pivot for Long-Term Portfolio Building

The Nifty Total Market Index can serve as a core around which to build a long-term wealth creation portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. For example, to achieve a 2:1:1 allocation (50% large-caps, 25% mid-caps, 25% small-caps), one could use the Nifty Total Market Index, which naturally provides a dose of micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Alternatively, for a 60:20:20 split, the Nifty Total Market Index can adequately serve the purpose without needing multiple schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. It can also be combined with other indices, such as the Nifty MidSmallcap 400 Index, as new indices become available from AMCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Nifty Total Market Index fund is a beneficial option for investors seeking a low-cost, diversified, and passively managed investment vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. It is easy to understand and, to date, offers the truest representation of the Indian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. While its performance is tied to the overall Indian stock market, making it subject to economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, it presents a powerful and simpler alternative to traditional [[nifty50_data_and_investment_analysis | Nifty50]] setups for wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

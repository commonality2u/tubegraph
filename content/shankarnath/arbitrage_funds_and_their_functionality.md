Arbitrage funds are a type of equity mutual fund designed to capitalize on price discrepancies in the cash and futures markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This strategy aims to generate returns regardless of overall market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## How Arbitrage Funds Work

The core method employed by arbitrage funds is known as "cash and carry arbitrage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This involves:
*   **Simultaneous Transactions** For example, if a share of Reliance Industries is priced at 3,000 rupees in the cash market and 3,050 rupees in the futures market, the fund would buy one share in the cash market and simultaneously sell it in the higher-priced futures market at the beginning of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Market Convergence** On the last day of the Futures and Options (FNO) expiry, the cash and futures markets typically converge in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Position Reversal** At this point, the investor reverses their position by selling in the cash market and buying from the futures market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

The advantage of this strategy is that an arbitrage fund can make money from these mispricings irrespective of whether the price of the underlying asset goes up, down, or stays the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This makes volatility work to the investor's advantage, a unique characteristic among mutual fund categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Returns and Risk Profile

The performance of arbitrage funds is influenced by demand, volatility, and spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   When spreads are high, these funds have historically delivered returns in the range of 8% to 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   When spreads narrow, returns typically fall to the 4% to 5% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

Arbitrage funds are generally considered low-risk investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Suitability and Taxation

Arbitrage funds are well-suited for parking funds for a short duration, typically 9 to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. They offer a relatively tax-efficient option because capital gains from these funds are taxed on an equity basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Role in Investment Strategies

Arbitrage is also a component in other [[exploring_arbitrage_and_equity_savings_funds | hybrid funds]] such as [[exploring_arbitrage_and_equity_savings_funds | equity savings funds]], where it's used alongside equity and debt to provide downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. When deploying parked funds into equities, a Systematic Transfer Plan ([[rebalancing_and_switching_strategies_in_mutual_funds | STP]]) can be used, with the source money originating from an [[leveraging_debt_mutual_funds_and_etfs | arbitrage fund]] or [[leveraging_debt_mutual_funds_and_etfs | debt mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

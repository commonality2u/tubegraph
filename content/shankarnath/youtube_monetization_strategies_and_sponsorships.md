The speaker provides an overview of their monetization strategies for their YouTube channel and associated ventures, reflecting on 2024 performance and outlining plans for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This journey highlights the potential for [[monetizing_personal_skills | monetizing personal skills]] and building a sustainable business through content creation.

## YouTube Performance in 2024

In 2024, the channel significantly grew its subscriber base, more than doubling its tally to over 2.5 lakh subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The speaker posted 49 long-format videos, averaging almost one video per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
A notable achievement is that out of 140 videos posted so far, 36 have garnered over 1 lakh views, and another 39 videos have been viewed at least 50,000 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Income Streams

The speaker details two primary income streams from their YouTube presence:

### 1. YouTube AdSense Monetization

Views directly translate to advertising money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. On average, the channel received approximately 13 to 14 PESA in advertising money for every view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
For 2024, with a total of over 1 crore views, the YouTube monetization program yielded 14 lakhs in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

An important aspect of this income is its passive nature:
*   Videos published in 2024 generated 9.2 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Older videos, published in previous years, contributed 4.9 lakhs in 2024, effectively acting as passive income of about 40,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### 2. Brand Sponsorships

Brand sponsorships are a significant part of the channel's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. These can take the form of:
*   A one-minute insertion within a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   A dedicated video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The speaker acknowledges that some viewers are critical of creators engaging in sponsorship deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. However, they explain that sponsorships are crucial for a creator's personal finances, especially in the initial stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Currently, sponsorships account for 75% of the speaker's income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While this mix is expected to change in 2025, endorsements are likely to remain, potentially settling at around 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Other Potential Income Streams

The speaker also discusses other potential income streams and why they avoid certain ones:
*   **Courses**: Despite others creating courses, the speaker has not started one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Income**: The speaker does not receive any affiliate income or commission from financial organizations, despite offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This is due to a perceived conflict of interest, though they would disclose the nature of such transactions if they were to engage in them in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Channel Expenses and Profit

Revenue numbers do not factor in expenses such as:
*   Cost of editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Recording costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   Salary paid to a researcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Equipment costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

The estimated pre-tax profit for the last year was around 40 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, which is still only two-thirds of what the speaker earned at a previous job two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Leveraging Skills and AI

The speaker emphasizes the importance of extending a single skill, which in their case is strong research and presenting financial content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. They highlight that their video presentation skills were new and developed through practice, starting at the age of 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This journey from a salaried position to self-employment is part of a broader theme of building an "upside" for oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

A crucial skill in today's times is the ability to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advance one's career and grow a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The speaker uses AI for various tasks:
*   Creating video thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Cleaning up newsletters after pulling financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Organizing data into tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Summarizing long articles, earnings calls, and presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
AI not only makes tasks easier but also helps grow the business faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Future Plans for 2025

For 2025, the speaker is focused on developing two key properties, revolving around research and advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>:

### 1. Paid Community

This will serve as a primary offering, combining research, learning, and advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. It is envisioned to have four main components:
*   **Action**: Original research across stocks, sectors, mutual funds, updates on covered stocks, and a discussion forum for daily investing opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Learn**: Workshops and "30-minute sprints" on practical topics like calculating EPS, selecting bonds, building long-term mutual fund portfolios, and analyzing sector trends, done in an interactive format with live examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Support**: A dedicated Q&A area for member concerns and a tools/resources section on investing and personal finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Community**: A mix of online and physical events, group chats, rewards, and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
The final form of the community will be influenced by SEBI regulations, as the speaker has applied for a Research Analyst (RA) license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This initiative relates to [[creating_a_paid_research_and_advice_community | creating a paid research and advice community]].

### 2. Smallcase or Series of Smallcases

This initiative is a response to viewer requests and is made possible by the potential RA license and the speaker's improved investing approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Options include:
*   An actively managed smallcase that mirrors the speaker's personal portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   A series of smallcases based on various [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing patterns and strategies]] or "cloning strategies" the speaker has learned and applied, such as:
    *   Magic Formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
    *   Shameless Cloning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
    *   Trending Value Losers Portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
    *   G. Peter Lynch 100 Baggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
    *   Monopoly Stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>

These new initiatives represent significant step-ups requiring considerable effort and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The speaker is optimistic about the potential for a 2X or 3X income upside in the third year of their self-employed journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

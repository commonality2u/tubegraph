The [[Piotroski Score and Financial Health Indicators | Piotroski Score]], also known as Piotroski's F-Score, is a scoring mechanism developed by Joseph Piotrosky in 2000 to assess the financial health and strength of a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It scores companies on a scale of zero to nine, with higher scores (7, 8, or 9) indicating a financially strong company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Original Backtesting Claims

The [[Piotroski Score and Financial Health Indicators | Piotroski Score]] gained prominence because Piotrosky himself claimed to have generated upwards of 20% in Return on Investment (ROI) by [[Backtesting and Performance of Magic Formula | backtesting]] data and buying stocks according to his system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This established it as a very popular metric for [[Evaluating stock market metrics for investment decisions | evaluating stock market metrics for investment decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Effectiveness in the Indian Environment

To evaluate the [[Piotroski Score and Financial Health Indicators | Piotroski Score]]'s effectiveness in an Indian market context, an analysis was conducted on the Nifty 200 set of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

*   **High-Scoring Companies**: Only four companies in the Nifty 200 achieved a top score of nine: Coal India, Varun Beverages, Pi Industries, and Oil India Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. However, a significant number of fundamentally strong companies exist, with about 35% of companies across various market caps having an F-score of 7, 8, or 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Performance of High-Scoring Portfolios**: [[Backtesting and Performance of Magic Formula | Backtesting]] the performance of a portfolio of high-scoring companies requires serious analysis tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
    *   A July 2021 presentation by Aditya Birla Capital, listing 28 companies with a [[Piotroski Score and Financial Health Indicators | Piotroski Score]] of at least seven, was used for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
    *   The returns from this portfolio over the subsequent two years were roughly equivalent to what the Nifty 50 delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
    *   Even applying other techniques like the [[Performance analysis of losers portfolio | losers portfolio]] strategy resulted in returns of only 12.2%, which was considered just "par for the course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

The original [[Piotroski Score and Financial Health Indicators | Piotroski Score]] system appeared to be "missing some crucial elements," particularly valuations (the price at which a fundamentally strong company becomes a strong buy or sell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The original nine parameters are purely based on company financials and are not market-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Modified Piotroski Score for Improved Returns

Research conducted by individuals from BITS Pilani proposed a [[modified_piotroski_score_incorporating_market_factors | modified Piotroski Score]] aimed at achieving higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### Key Modifications

*   **Variables Removed**: Two variables from the original [[understanding_the_piotroski_score | Piotroski Score]] were removed: Return on Equity (RoE) and Operating Cash Flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Variables Introduced**: Four additional variables were introduced to address the valuation gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>:
    *   Price-to-Earnings (P/E) multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>
    *   Price-to-Book Value (P/B) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>
    *   Enterprise Value (EV) upon EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>
    *   Incremental changes in the firm's free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>
    These additions were a clear attempt to identify undervalued companies from a list of fundamentally strong ones by incorporating market-driven metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Additional Technical Indicators

Beyond the revised 11 financial variables, the research team also incorporated two technical indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>:
*   Moving Average Crossover: Used to identify an uptrend and thus indicate which stocks to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   Average Directional Movement Index (ADX): Used to gauge the strength of a trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Backtesting Results of the Modified Score

The [[Backtesting and Performance of Magic Formula | backtesting]] of this modified 13-variable approach yielded "amazing results," showing a significant jump in annualized returns and the Sharpe ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This suggests the modified approach is worth considering for investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[Piotroski Score and Financial Health Indicators | Piotroski Score]] offers a systematic approach to [[Evaluating Stock Performance Using Financial Ratios | evaluate stock performance using financial ratios]] by focusing on profitability, leverage, liquidity, and operating efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. While the original score may not be foolproof due to the dynamic nature of financial numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, parts of its system can significantly improve the chances of picking the right companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. The [[modified_piotroski_score_incorporating_market_factors | modified Piotroski Score Incorporating Market Factors]] and technical indicators show promise in enhancing investment returns.

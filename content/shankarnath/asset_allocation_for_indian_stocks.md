A common misconception is that an all-weather portfolio is designed to outperform under all conditions and scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its true goal is to be prepared for any economic condition or calamity, with "prepared" being the operative word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Since economic conditions will inevitably involve both good and bad times, a portfolio and [[asset_allocation_strategy | strategy]] must adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The All-Weather Portfolio Concept

The all-weather portfolio is the brainchild of Ray Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. From an [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] perspective, Dalio's original model allocates:
*   30% in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   40% in long-term bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   15% in intermediate-term bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   7.5% in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   7.5% in commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

This allocation emphasizes wealth protection across economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, leading to a lower 30% weighting for equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### The Four Economic Seasons

Ray Dalio identifies four economic "seasons" that affect asset values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:
1.  **Inflation:** An increase in the price of goods and services, diminishing currency value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
2.  **Deflation:** A decrease in the price of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
3.  **Growth (Economic Expansion):** Periods when the economy flourishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
4.  **Declining Growth (Economic Recession):** Periods of economic contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Dalio defines which assets perform best in each season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:
*   **Inflation:** Gold and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   **Deflation:** Bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   **Economic Expansion:** Growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   **Recessionary Environment:** Bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

This matrix explains Dalio's higher allocation to bonds compared to equities or gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The all-weather portfolio is built to sustain economic surprises rather than for pure performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While it may fall short of a pure equity index like the S&P 500, it excels in low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## All-Weather Portfolio in the Indian Context

To adapt Dalio's [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] to India, an Indianized all-weather portfolio was constructed with the following hypothetical allocation and assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
*   30% to the Nifty50 TRRI (Total Return Index) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
*   40% to 30-year Government of India (GOI) bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   15% to 10-year GOI bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
*   15% to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>

This portfolio was annually rebalanced, a practice highly recommended by Dalio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Performance in India

Over the last 15 years, the Indianized all-weather portfolio delivered an annualized return of 9.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. In contrast, the Nifty50 TRRI delivered 8.8% over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This backtesting began in 2007, encompassing the 2008 global financial crisis, which significantly impacted equity values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

The all-weather concept proved its efficacy in protecting investors from economic shocks:
*   In 2008, when the Nifty was down by 50%, the all-weather portfolio was only down 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   In 2011, when the Nifty was down by 23%, the portfolio was positive 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

The portfolio consistently delivered average returns of 9.5% while equity and gold showed more volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It also exhibited the lowest volatility compared to equity and gold, efficiently handling economic surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. A portfolio offering 9-10% returns at very low volatility can be a viable alternative to fixed deposits for investors like retirees or those with critical financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Building Your Own All-Weather Portfolio

Three key areas need to be mastered when constructing an all-weather portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>:

### 1. Diversification
Getting the asset mix right is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Different asset classes perform differently, and it's highly unlikely that all will be negative simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The aim is to build a portfolio where the sum is greater than its parts, even if one or two asset classes falter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
It's important to diversify with assets that have a low or negative correlation to one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example, the performance of equities and gold has been tangential over different periods, making gold a solid hedge for equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Ray Dalio recommends 7.5% to 15% in hedge assets like gold and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
Conversely, diversifying with assets that appear different but move together (e.g., Nifty50 and Nifty Midcap 150) does not serve diversification goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### 2. Rebalancing
Rebalancing is a critical component of the all-weather strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. For the Indian all-weather portfolio, rebalancing resulted in an annualized return of 9.5% compared to 9.3% without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. While performance varies, maintaining the original [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### 3. Systematic Investing (SIP)
Systematic Investing Plans (SIPs) are a perfect companion for the all-weather portfolio because they help chip away extreme highs and lows, smoothing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This further reduces volatility and can improve post-tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Approaches to Implementing an All-Weather Portfolio

There are several ways to build an all-weather portfolio in India:

### 1. Do-It-Yourself (DIY)
A DIY approach involves combining passively managed instruments like ETFs and mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. For an Indian context, a potential DIY allocation mirroring Dalio's structure could include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>:
*   30% allocation to a Nifty 500 or BSE 500 ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>
*   40% allocation to long-term government of India bonds or Bharat bonds maturing in 2032 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>
*   15% allocation to medium-term bonds (4-5 year maturity), bought directly from RBI or as an ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   7.5% allocation to gold (via Gold ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>
*   7.5% allocation to commodities (e.g., Nifty Commodities ETF, if available) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>

This combination aims for a peaceful portfolio with good risk-adjusted returns, capable of surviving diverse economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### 2. Managed Funds (Dynamic Asset Allocation Funds)
Also known as Balance Advantage Funds, these are managed options that mix debt, equity, and gold to provide an all-weather flavor with draw-down support and automatic rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The ICICI Prudential Balance Advantage Fund is a notable example, with active equity allocation ranging from 30% to 80% based on market valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
Over a 15-year period, the passive bond-centric DIY all-weather portfolio surprisingly outperformed the ICICI BAFF in terms of returns and volatility, primarily due to its resilience during crisis years like 2008 and 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### 3. Smallcase Platform
Smallcase offers several all-weather offerings, mostly combinations of ETFs, similar to the DIY portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. In a recent one-year period, the DIY all-weather portfolio managed to outperform most of these smallcases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### 4. Low Beta Stocks
This approach focuses on low-beta or defensive stocks that exhibit less movement than the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. These act as safe assets, reducing portfolio variability and protecting investors during recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Sectors like FMCG, pharma, IT services, consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities often contain such stocks due to their stable demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Investors can buy these stocks directly, via smallcases, or through ETFs/mutual funds like the Nifty Low Volatility Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. However, stocks are inherently riskier, and it's challenging for equities to operate at less than 10% volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### 5. Barbell Strategy
The barbell strategy involves using two extreme investing methods, such as value and growth investing, which are traditionally considered poles apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The theory is that these opposing forces will counteract each other, leading to moderate returns at low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. When testing a momentum fund and a value fund combined with annual rebalancing, this approach showed higher returns than the all-weather portfolio but also extremely high volatility, which defeats the purpose of low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Other factor-based strategies like quality, growth, or alpha might yield different results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

## Conclusion

The all-weather strategy, built on diversified assets like equity, gold, and debt, along with annual rebalancing and systematic investing, appears to work effectively in the Indian scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. It has historically offered stable 9-10% returns at super low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The Indian all-weather portfolio skillfully navigated tough economic conditions in 2008, 2011, and 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

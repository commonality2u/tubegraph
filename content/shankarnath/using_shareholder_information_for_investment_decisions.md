The concept of "Shameless Cloning" in investing, introduced by Mr. Mish Pab, involves riding on the high-conviction ideas of others to generate returns for oneself and clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy acknowledges that even copying requires intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While many investment experts share ideas, there often isn't a clear, replicable, and profitable system to implement them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This article outlines a framework for identifying investable ideas from others and packaging them into a "shamelessly cloned portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Sourcing Authentic Investment Information

In an age of abundant information from various sources like news channels, YouTube, and social media, discerning trustworthy investment advice is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. A significant portion of this information can be misleading or merely fluid opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### SEBI's Disclosure Rule

A key source of authentic information comes from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. In 2016, SEBI mandated that all publicly listed companies must disclose the names of shareholders holding more than 1% in that company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This rule provides a verifiable anchor and a strong indicator of genuine investing intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

For instance, if an investor like Mr. Vijay Kedia expresses enthusiasm for a stock such as Patel Engineering on television, one can verify this by checking the company's shareholding pattern on the BSE India website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Seeing "Kedia Securities Private Limited" listed confirms the genuine investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## The Cloning Study Methodology

The cloning study utilizes this 1%+ shareholding information, which can be extracted free of cost from platforms like Trendline.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Investor Selection

The study selected 10 "Mari investors" (superstar shareholders) from Trendline.com's list of 80, based on two criteria:
*   They possess a sizable corpus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   They hold a decent number of stocks where their shareholding was upwards of 1% as of December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

These 10 investors collectively held over 77,000 crores across more than 370 stocks (based on their 1%+ holdings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Measuring Conviction

To prune this extensive list of stocks to a more manageable number (around 50), the study focused on stocks where these investors had their "highest conviction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
Conviction was defined not by the amount of corpus invested, but by the *percentage of shareholding* the investor held in a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   **Example: Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Associates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
    *   If conviction was based on corpus amount, top stocks would be Titan (~7,000 cr), Tata Motors (~5,000 cr), and Star Health (~5,000 cr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   However, using percentage of shareholding, the top picks become:
        *   Apptech Limited: 43%+ equity shareholding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>
        *   Concord Biotech: 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
        *   Star Health: 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
        *   Metro Brands: 9.6% (previously over 14%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
        *   NCC Limited: 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

This percentage-based approach was chosen for its authenticity, simplicity, and adequacy for testing the thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Simulating the Shamelessly Cloned Portfolio

The simulation involved a series of steps over the last eight quarters:

1.  **Data Extraction**: Extract 1%+ shareholding information from Trendline.com and paste it into a Google spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
2.  **Code Identification**: Use Chat GPT to obtain BSE and NSE codes for each stock, followed by some manual cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
3.  **Price Extraction**: Use Google Finance to extract share prices for approximately 386 stocks across eight quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
4.  **Top Stock Identification**: Identify the top 3-4 stocks per investor based on the percentage shareholding method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
5.  **Data Cleanup**: Manually determine original investment dates, and when an investor exited or lost conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
6.  **Investment Simulation**: Simulate an investment of 10,000 rupees at each entry point and sell the investment at market price to calculate profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Simulation Results

The simulation, involving an investment of 10,000 rupees in a total of 57 stocks (totaling 570,000 rupees), yielded significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>:

*   **Total Profit**: 387,000 rupees over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Annualized Return**: A "delicious" 41.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

This return placed the portfolio firmly in the top 1% of all equity mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. In comparison:
*   Nifty50 returned 12.5% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   The best-performing actively managed small cap fund, Quant Small Cap Fund, returned 29.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Important Considerations and Limitations

While "shamelessly cloning" a portfolio appears to be less work and can yield excellent results, several factors require attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>:

*   **Process Assumptions**: The study made several assumptions, such as the reliance on the percentage shareholding method and the selection of specific investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Data Accuracy**: Multiple tools (Google Finance, Chat GPT) were used, which might lead to minor errors (e.g., company name changes, different stock codes) requiring manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Information Delay**: The shareholding information used is typically delayed by 2-3 weeks from the end of the quarter to its disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Stock Categories**: A large number (over 80%) of the filtered 57 stocks were small caps and micro caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Investors uncomfortable with the higher volatility of smaller companies should consider this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Losses**: Despite consisting of high-conviction bets from top investors, 20 out of 57 stocks (35%) in this portfolio were exited at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This highlights that even expert investors make mistakes and that about one-third of picks might not perform as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

Currently, there are no known mutual funds or small cases specifically built around this "shameless cloning" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This is likely because justifying an expense ratio for simply copying ideas would be difficult, and it might not align with a fund manager's professional image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

The study supports Mr. Pab's claim that Shameless Cloning can be a highly effective investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Further studies can explore better selection criteria, investors, or tools to build even more replicable, scalable, and profitable portfolios using this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Investing in [[basics_of_small_cap_investing | small cap investing]] has become a popular addition to many portfolios over the last three to five years, moving away from a sole focus on blue-chip stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Grow Mutual Fund is launching a Nifty Small Cap 250 Index Fund AFO, with subscriptions opening on February 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Why Consider Small Caps?

Small cap companies are generally perceived as high-risk stocks, but they also offer the potential for significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The principle of "high risk, high return" applies to this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Historically, many stocks that have generated 10x returns in the last decade have been in the small cap category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Small cap stocks have also demonstrated superior earnings growth compared to mid-cap and large-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While there is significant growth potential, investors must acknowledge the inherently high risk associated with this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Understanding the Nifty Small Cap 250 Index

Companies are categorized into large caps, mid caps, and small caps based on market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>:
*   **Large Caps**: Top 100 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Mid Caps**: Companies ranked 101 to 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Small Caps**: Companies ranked 251 to 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The Nifty Small Cap 250 Index comprises these 250 small cap stocks, spread across 21 sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Importance of Diversification in Small Caps

Diversification is crucial in the small cap space because it helps in reducing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. As small caps are a high-risk category, selecting the wrong individual stock can lead to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Over the last five years, small caps have shown the highest percentage of stocks with negative returns compared to mid caps and large caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Investing in the entire basket of the small cap universe through an index fund can significantly lower this downside risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Ways to Invest in Small Caps

Investors can approach [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap investing]] in three primary ways:

1.  **Directly Buying Small Cap Stocks**: Small cap stocks are very volatile, and selecting the right stock is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. A wrong selection can lead to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
2.  **Investing in Actively Managed Small Cap Funds**: There are 24 active small cap funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. However, each fund's investment philosophy differs, leading to varied returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. There is no guarantee that a top-performing actively managed fund will continue to excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. It's advisable to consult a financial advisor when selecting an actively managed fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
3.  **Investing in a Small Cap Index Fund**: This approach involves [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | investing]] in the entire universe of small caps, mirroring the index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The fund holds the same 250 stocks as the index in the exact same weightage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This strategy provides diversification across 21 sectors, which is crucial for managing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. It also ensures coverage of potentially high-performing small cap companies that an individual investor might otherwise miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Historical Performance and Valuation

### Historical Performance
When evaluating small cap performance, it's essential to look at long-term returns, as it is a risky category requiring a long investment horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Nifty Small Cap Index**: Has given a 10-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Nifty 50 Index**: Has given a 10-year return of approximately 12.96% over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
    *   This represents a substantial difference of nearly 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   For example, a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of ₹15,200 in a small cap index fund over 15 years could have accumulated approximately ₹1 crore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

The selection of the right small cap stock is critical, as it can be the difference between a 100x return and a 0x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Valuation
Valuation helps investors determine if a stock is overpriced, underpriced, or fairly priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. A common parameter for valuation is the **Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, calculated by dividing the stock's price by its earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The PE ratio indicates how much an investor is willing to pay for every unit of earnings; a lower PE ratio is generally better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

The PE ratio of the Nifty Small Cap Index is currently around 25.62 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This suggests the index is undervalued compared to active funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Furthermore, the current PE ratio of the small cap index is lower than its five-year average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, indicating it is favorably priced for potential investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Why Consider the Grow Nifty Small Cap 250 Index Fund?

The primary purpose of an index fund is to replicate or mirror an index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. However, achieving exact mirroring is challenging due to "tracking error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Tracking error measures how closely a fund replicates its benchmark index; a lower tracking error indicates better mirroring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The weightage of stocks within an index constantly changes, largely due to fluctuating stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, making 100% accuracy impossible for any index fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

Grow Mutual Fund has developed an in-house proprietary technology called **Spear** to reduce this tracking error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. While rebalancing in typical index funds occurs weekly or bi-weekly, Spear facilitates more frequent rebalancing, thereby reducing the tracking error and ensuring the index fund matches its index to a greater extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Who Should Invest in a Small Cap Index Fund?

A small cap index fund may be suitable for investors who:
*   Have a high risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. If your risk appetite is not high, this might not be the right fund for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   Wish to invest in small cap stocks or funds but are unsure about selecting the right individual stock or actively managed fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. An index fund simplifies this process by removing the need for stock picking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   Have a long-term investment horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

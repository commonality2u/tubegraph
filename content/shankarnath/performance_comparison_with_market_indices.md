The Trending Value strategy has demonstrated significant outperformance when compared to various market indices across different timeframes and geographies. This section details these comparisons, highlighting the strategy's effectiveness.

## Initial Performance Snapshot (Past 11 Months)

A portfolio of 25 stocks selected using the Trending Value strategy delivered an annualized gain of 96.9% over approximately 11 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. In the same period:
*   The Nifty 50 gained about 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   The Midcap 150 Index saw a 52% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   Factor funds like Momentum and Alpha performed better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, with a Nifty 50-related fund delivering a solid 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   Some sectoral indices, notably the Nifty PSSE Index, crossed the 90% mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

However, none of these indices or funds surpassed the 96.9% return generated by the Trending Value strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Historical Outperformance (US Market)

The Trending Value strategy has consistently outperformed the broader market index, showing a 10% alpha for over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Between 1964 and 2009, the strategy delivered annualized returns of 21.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. In contrast, the S&P 500 delivered 9.5% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. An investment of $10,000 at the start of 1964 would have grown to over $69 million using this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Comparison of Investment Strategies (Over 45 Years)

James O'Shaughnessy's back-testing over 45 years revealed the following annualized returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>:

*   **Undervalued Stocks (Value Composite 2 Indicator)**: 17.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Combination of Value and Momentum (Trending Value Strategy)**: 21.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

This demonstrates that the combined approach of the Trending Value strategy yields the highest returns among these methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Indian Market Performance

Back-testing the Trending Value strategy on Indian stocks by Capital Mind from 2007 to 2023 (a 16-year timeframe) showed significant outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>:
*   The Trending Value strategy achieved a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
*   The Nifty 50 delivered only 9.9% during the same 16-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   This indicates a 10% alpha generated by the Trending Value strategy over the Nifty 50, consistent with O'Shaughnessy's findings in the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
*   Analysis of rolling returns over a 10-year period also consistently showed outperformance compared to the Nifty 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Key Characteristics and Volatility

The Capital Mind study highlighted that Trending Value tends to be more of a small cap strategy, which aligns with the current portfolio where almost 90% of the stocks are small or micro-cap in terms of market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

One observed negative of the strategy is the higher level of portfolio volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This is understandable given the high exposure to small-cap and micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Despite this, the Trending Value strategy has consistently performed well in various markets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

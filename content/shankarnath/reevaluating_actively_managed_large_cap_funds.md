While large cap funds are generally considered a beneficial component of an investment portfolio, with an advocacy for at least 50% of one's equity allocation in them, the [[Shift from Actively Managed to Passive Funds | actively managed]] large cap category specifically warrants a re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Reasons for Reevaluation

After the 2018 SEBI reclassification, which redefined what constitutes a large cap and what goes into a large cap fund, the majority of [[Shift from Actively Managed to Passive Funds | actively managed]] funds have struggled to outperform their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Outperformance by Index Funds
[[market_capitalization_based_index_funds | Nifty 50 index funds]] have demonstrated superior performance, outperforming the average large cap fund in four out of the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This trend suggests that, in most years, [[Shift from Actively Managed to Passive Funds | passively managed index funds]] are likely to continue to beat the majority of [[Shift from Actively Managed to Passive Funds | actively managed]] ones, unless significant market changes occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

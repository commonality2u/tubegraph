When tasked with constructing a portfolio limited to just two funds—which could be actively managed mutual funds, index funds, ETFs, or a combination—the solution proved to be challenging due to the multitude of categories, capitalizations, and investing styles available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. After analyzing various parameters such as returns, volatility, drawdowns, and existing research, a surprising combination emerged as the most comfortable choice: a momentum fund and a value fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Understanding Momentum and Value Investing

### Momentum Investing
Momentum in investing refers to the tendency for investments that have performed relatively well to continue performing well for some time, and conversely, those that have performed poorly will continue to do so in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This concept might seem counterintuitive to the conventional wisdom of "buy low, sell high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. An example of momentum in action is when a player like Yuvraj Singh hits multiple sixes, indicating he has the forward momentum to continue his performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Value Investing
Value investing, in contrast, focuses on identifying investments priced significantly lower than their intrinsic or real worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The "value factor" aims to identify this gap between the current price and the true worth of an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. A cricketing analogy for value investing is the Rajasthan Royals team in 2008, which spent less than 60% of the maximum budget, picked players priced lower than their real value, and still won the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Why Momentum and Value?

Both momentum and value strategies are based on market anomalies, occurring when investors either over- or under-react to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. While neither strategy works all the time, a key characteristic that makes their combination appealing for a [[portfolio_asset_allocation_with_two_funds | two-fund portfolio]] is their negative correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This negative correlation is rare in equities and allows the combination to help achieve objectives related to returns, [[portfolio_asset_allocation_with_two_funds | asset allocation]], and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The investor profiles for these two strategies are also distinct:
*   **Value Investor:** Focuses on research and the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Momentum Investor:** Looks for short-term price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Performance of a Momentum and Value Combination

A study examining data from 2006 onwards using the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index and the Nifty 500 Value 50 index revealed that both momentum and value strategies performed well independently, with momentum leading in lump sum and SIP performance and also in terms of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. However, research suggests that combining momentum and value can yield even better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Simple 50/50 Allocation
A straightforward [[portfolio_asset_allocation_with_two_funds | portfolio asset allocation with two funds]] of 50% into a momentum index and 50% into a value index yielded an average return of 16.2% over a 17-year period, outperforming popular indices like the Nifty 50 and Nifty Midcap 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Incorporating [[rebalancing_and_switching_strategies_in_mutual_funds | Rebalancing and Switching Strategies in Mutual Funds]]
Applying an annual [[rebalancing_and_switching_strategies_in_mutual_funds | rebalancing and switching strategy in mutual funds]] to the 50/50 combination slightly improved returns by 0.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. A six-month rebalancing further increased the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) to 16.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. However, post-tax returns for all three options (no rebalancing, annual, and six-month rebalancing) would likely be similar due to higher short-term capital gains tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Historical data suggests that this 50/50 strategy can consistently offer 15% to 16% per annum on a rolling return basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The significant performance difference between momentum and value indices in various years (e.g., 2006, 2009-2011, 2013-2016, 2018-2019, 2022) highlights their differing behaviors and makes their combination powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Advanced [[rebalancing_and_switching_strategies_in_mutual_funds | Rebalancing and Switching Strategies in Mutual Funds]]

To potentially achieve even greater returns by leveraging the up and down movements of these factors, more complex [[rebalancing_and_switching_strategies_in_mutual_funds | switching strategies in mutual funds]] can be employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

#### Momentum-Based Switch Method
This method involves switching between funds based on the momentum index's performance. For instance, if the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index rises by 20% over a three-month period, it suggests positive market momentum, prompting a switch to the momentum index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Conversely, a 20% drop would prompt a switch to the value strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Over a 17-year period, this strategy required only four switches, yielding a 17-year CAGR of 22.2%, a significant improvement over the static 50/50 combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

#### P/E Ratio-Based Switching Method
An alternative [[rebalancing_and_switching_strategies_in_mutual_funds | switching strategy in mutual funds]] uses P/E ratio bands to determine when to switch. For example, if the Nifty 50 P/E ratio falls below 18, one might switch to a momentum strategy, and if it crosses 24, become more value-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This approach yielded a 17-year CAGR of 15.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

A portfolio composed of a momentum fund and a value fund is considered ideally suited for a two-fund lifetime portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The reasons for this belief are:
*   **High Performance:** Both factors demonstrate strong performance in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Weak Correlation:** Their weak correlation adds an essential [[portfolio_asset_allocation_with_two_funds | asset allocation]] element, helping to manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Performance Improvement:** Investors can enhance portfolio performance without increasing volatility by implementing strategies like rebalancing or momentum-based switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

[[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | Unlisted shares]] represent ownership in a company whose shares have not yet been listed on an Indian stock exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. These are also known as pre-IPO shares or private equity shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

Examples of companies with unlisted shares include:
*   Young, innovative, high-growth companies like Byju's, OYO, and Ola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.
*   Established companies with decades of experience, such as the National Stock Exchange and the Serum Institute of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.
*   Subsidiaries of larger companies like Jio, Flipkart, Reliance Retail, and HDFC Securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.
*   Companies that were once listed but have since delisted, such as Otis Elevators and Capgemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a>.

Even though these companies are not listed, their shares can still be traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## The Gray Market

Trading in [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] often occurs via the Over-The-Counter (OTC) market, also known as the gray market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. Despite the name, trading in [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] is not illegal in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. The gray market is a network of brokers and dealers who buy and sell unlisted shares for themselves and their clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:18">[01:55:18]</a>.

However, these gray markets are not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This lack of regulation means there is less transparency and more risk involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Why Invest in Unlisted Shares?

There are several reasons investors consider [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]]:
*   **Early Exposure**: Opportunity for early exposure to high-growth startups in promising sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Diversification**: Ownership in these companies can help diversify an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Incentive**: Significant profits can be made when the company goes public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. For instance, Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited saw an almost immediate 8% increase in share price after MS Dhoni lifted a trophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. CSK's stock, spun off in November 2018 at ₹12-15, reached ₹185, representing a CAGR of 79% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **[[Taxation on unlisted shares | Tax Benefits]]**: Certain tax benefits can be availed under schemes like Section 54EC and Section 54F of the Income Tax Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

## [[risks_and_challenges_of_investing_in_unlisted_shares | Risks and Challenges of Investing in Unlisted Shares]]

Investing in [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] comes with its own set of [[investment_risks_in_unlisted_shares | risks and challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>:

*   **Liquidity Risk**: It can be difficult, sometimes almost impossible, to buy or sell [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Capital Loss**: The unlisted company might fail to perform or even go bankrupt, leading to a total loss of investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Dilution Risk**: Share value and ownership of existing shareholders can be reduced due to ESOPs, preferential allotment rights, or rights issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Fraud Element**: [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | Unlisted shares]] are prone to scams and manipulations by unscrupulous brokers and promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Common tactics include:
    *   Sale of fake or duplicate shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
    *   Misrepresenting company financials or prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
    *   Inflating prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
    *   Non-transfer of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

Safety is a primary concern for retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Challenges exist at every step, including:
*   **Middleman Risk**: The need to be careful with whom you work, as the middleman himself poses a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Company Information**: Limited knowledge about the company, often relying on potentially non-credible research reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   **Price Discovery**: What is referred to as price is often just a negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

## Regulatory Authority (SEBI) and Other Avenues for Grievances

The SEBI can be approached for issues like fraud, manipulation, default, or dispute related to [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. However, SEBI has limited jurisdiction and powers over [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]], only taking action if the SEBI Act, regulations, or listing agreement are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

Aggrieved investors can also approach other authorities such as the RBI, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, or the courts in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Avenues to Acquire Unlisted Shares

Shares in [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted companies]] can be acquired through several avenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>:
*   **Startups**: Via angel networks, crowdfunding platforms, incubators, accelerators, or venture capital funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
*   **Professional Management Services (PMS) or Alternative Investment Funds (AIF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **ESOPs**: Bought from employees or promoters of [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   **IPO Allottees**: Shares acquired from IPO allottees willing to sell before listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

*   **[[online_platforms_for_trading_unlisted_shares | Online Platforms]]**: Connect and facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

It is advisable to connect with individuals experienced in these methods and learn from their experiences before diving in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

## [[process_of_buying_unlisted_shares | Process of Buying Unlisted Shares]]

While specifics may vary, there are seven essential [[steps_to_buy_unlisted_shares | steps to follow]] when buying [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>:

1.  **Finding a Seller**: Top sources include [[online_platforms_for_trading_unlisted_shares | online platforms]], brokers, and personal contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
2.  **Due Diligence**: Thorough research on the company, its financials, promoters, growth prospects, business risk, and valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Intermediaries may provide PDF reports or website details. When meeting a seller face-to-face, ask questions to verify authenticity, legality, terms, and intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
3.  **Price Negotiation**: Retail investors can talk to multiple brokers/sellers and bluff about their intentions (e.g., wanting to buy 5,000 shares to one, selling 10,000 to another) to gauge demand and supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. [[online_platforms_for_trading_unlisted_shares | Online platforms]] often have an "Instabuy" section (e.g., on stockx.in for Reliance Retail, CSK, PharmEasy shares) which indicates share availability and negotiation potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
4.  **Signing a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA)**: A legally enforceable document outlining terms and conditions, including the number and price of shares, completion procedures, representations, and warranties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
5.  **Payment**: Investors should pay the seller via bank transfer or check only after ensuring the seller has a valid PAN card and the promised shares are available in their demat account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
6.  **Transfer of Shares**: The seller initiates an off-market transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
7.  **Receipt of Shares**: If smooth, the buyer should receive shares in their demat account within 24 hours of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. The investor should also receive a share certificate or confirmation letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

For sellers, the process is largely reversed, starting with finding buyers and ending with transferring shares in exchange for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

## Common Questions about Buying/Selling Unlisted Shares

*   **Minimum Investment Amount**: There's no strict minimum, but brokerages typically require ₹50,000, while [[online_platforms_for_trading_unlisted_shares | online platforms]] may accept as little as ₹10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
*   **Where to See Unlisted Shares**: After purchase, [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] are visible in your Demat account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. Each security is uniquely identified by a 12-digit alphanumeric International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. For example, the ISIN for API Holdings Limited (PharmEasy) is IN0DJ201029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.
*   **What Happens to Pre-IPO Shares After IPO**: Once an IPO occurs, [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] become listed and can be traded on a stock exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. Investors might face a lock-in or holding period before selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.
*   **NRI Investment**: Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are allowed to invest in [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted companies]] on a non-repatriation basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. If an NRI wishes to purchase on a repatriation basis, they must notify the RBI, as such investments are treated as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and are subject to stricter valuation, pricing norms, and higher reporting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. Consulting a chartered accountant is strongly advised for NRIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

## [[valuation_methods_for_unlisted_companies | Valuation Methods for Unlisted Companies]]

Finding the fair value of an [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted share]] is challenging due to limited information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. The fair value is the price at which a willing buyer and seller, both with adequate information and acting rationally, would agree to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

Three commonly used [[valuation_methods_for_unlisted_companies | methods of valuation]] are:

1.  **Comparable Company Analysis (Relative Valuation)**: Involves comparing the unlisted company with its peers or competitors in the same industry or sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. Analysts use valuation multiples like the P/E ratio, price-to-book value ratio, or price-to-sales to estimate fair value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. For example, Swiggy (Bundle Technologies Private Limited) can be compared with Zomato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.
2.  **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method**: Primarily for equity analysts, this method projects future cash flows of the unlisted company and discounts them to their present value using an appropriate discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. The present value of these cash flows represents the company's fair value, which can then be divided by the number of shares to get the fair value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.
3.  **Asset-Based Method**: A simpler method where total liabilities are deducted from total assets to determine the net assets, which represent the company's fair value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. This net asset value is then divided by the number of shares to find the fair value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

Each method fits a particular industry or sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. Investors new to valuations should research how companies are valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.

## [[Taxation on unlisted shares | Taxation on Unlisted Shares]]

Like other equity products, investors must pay [[taxation_on_unlisted_shares | taxes]] on capital gains and dividends received from [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.

*   **Dividends**: All dividends received are added to the investor's income and taxed according to their income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.
*   **Capital Gains**: Tax on capital gains arises only upon the sale of [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] at a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.
    *   **Long-Term Capital Gain**: If [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] are held for more than 24 months, gains are considered long-term and taxed at 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Short-Term Capital Gain**: If shares are sold within 24 months, short-term capital gain applies and is taxed according to the investor's income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
*   **Exemptions**:
    *   Under Section 54E or 54GB of the Income Tax Act, long-term capital gains from capital invested in a startup may be exempt up to ₹50 lakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.
    *   Sections 54EC and 54F allow investors to save tax on long-term capital gains by investing those gains in specified bonds or assets within a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.

It is strongly advised to consult a tax advisor or chartered accountant before acting on any tax-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Investing in [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] is both challenging and complex, requiring careful consideration of an investor's risk tolerance and return expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. The market for [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | unlisted shares]] is expected to grow as more private companies move towards public listing and as businesses transition from promoter-led informal economies to professionally managed formal setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

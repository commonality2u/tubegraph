When considering a term insurance policy, understanding both the selection criteria for providers and the factors influencing premiums is crucial for making an informed decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:01:33">[01:33:0]</a>.

## Selecting a Term Insurance Policy

The selection of a term insurance policy should primarily focus on ensuring that beneficiaries receive the claim without dispute, as the policyholder will not be around to make the claim themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

### Key Filtering Criteria

Several numerical metrics can help filter out less reliable providers:
*   **Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR)**: This ratio indicates how many claims an insurer settles out of those received. For death claims, a CSR of less than 98% should be viewed with wariness, as death leaves little room for dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Ideally, the CSR should be 99% or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This metric should serve as a filtering tool to reject companies, rather than a selection variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
*   **Amount Settlement Ratio**: This metric shows the percentage of the total claimed amount that the insurer pays out. A ratio below 90% is deeply problematic, suggesting the insurer might be skimping on larger claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   **Complaint Volume**: A high volume of complaints per 10,000 claims, especially above typical industry numbers (e.g., 100 complaints vs. 8-9 for top providers), can indicate issues with an insurer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

### Selection Based on Features and Scale

Once companies are filtered based on these ratios, selection should be based on features that best suit individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
*   **Add-ons (Riders)**: Policies can include riders for specific concerns, such as:
    *   **Critical Illness**: Provides a corpus for lost income due to serious illness, supplementing [[factors_affecting_health_insurance_coverage | health insurance]] which covers medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. Terms and conditions, including waiting periods and covered illnesses, vary by company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
    *   **Disability Benefit**: For those worried about long-term disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.
    *   **Accidental Death Benefit**: For individuals who travel frequently or have high-risk jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
    *   **Joint Term Plans**: Some providers offer plans that include a spouse, though this might involve compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.
*   **Provider Scale**: It's advisable to choose a provider with a large book of business and established scale, as smaller companies might experience issues with operations and claims settlement as they grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

### The Role of an Advisor

A trusted advisor or agent plays a significant [[role_of_advisors_in_managing_term_insurance_policies | role of advisors in managing term insurance policies]] in navigating the complexities of term insurance, especially during the [[term_insurance_policy_claim_process and challenges | claim process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. They act as a conduit between the insurance company and the customer, advocating on the customer's behalf and providing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>. This support is invaluable as the beneficiary, not the policyholder, deals with the claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.

## Premiums and Factors Affecting Them

The premium for a term insurance policy is influenced by several factors, including the policyholder's age, declared health status, and the chosen coverage amount and tenure.

### Calculating Coverage Amount and Tenure

*   **Tenure**: It is generally recommended to align the policy's tenure with your likely retirement age, typically between 60 and 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Extending coverage beyond this age, such as until 85 or 90, significantly increases premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The purpose of term insurance is to protect dependents during the earning years; once retired and a corpus is built, the need for a large cover diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Cover Amount**: There is no magic formula, but it involves mapping out anticipated expenses (e.g., marriage, children's education, home purchase) and liabilities (e.g., loans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. An advisor can help estimate the sum needed to financially replicate the policyholder's cash flows for their dependents, accounting for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. It's important to note that term insurance payouts are generally not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

### Impact of Health and Lifestyle Declarations

[[importance_of_accurate_declarations_in_term_insurance | Accurate declarations]] about health and lifestyle habits are paramount, as inaccuracies can lead to policy cancellation or claim rejection.
*   **Smoking Status**:
    *   Premiums for smokers can be almost double compared to non-smokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.
    *   If a smoker quits after purchasing a policy, premiums will not decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. Conversely, if a non-smoker starts smoking, their premiums will not increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.
    *   Lying on the application about smoking habits can lead to the application being rejected or the policy being canceled, and the individual may be blacklisted from purchasing term insurance from any company in the future due to shared information through common bureaus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. Insurers can investigate for up to three years after policy issuance and may find evidence through medical tests (nicotine detection), public records, or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.
*   **Pre-existing Conditions**:
    *   Individuals with [[specific_issues_related_to_term_insurance_for_smokers_and_preexisting_conditions | specific issues related to term insurance for smokers and preexisting conditions]] like hypertension can usually get a term insurance policy, but it will come with a "premium loading" (an extra charge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.
    *   Full disclosure of all health conditions is crucial, even if seemingly insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. Non-disclosure can lead to policy voidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
    *   Term plans have stricter medical underwriting than [[factors_affecting_health_insurance_coverage | health insurance]] plans due to the massive potential payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. Rejection is possible if the condition is deemed too risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.
    *   Even after a policy is issued, it's advisable to inform the insurance company of any material changes in health conditions, as this can help in disputing future rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

### Special Considerations

*   **Defense Personnel/Police Officers**: Those in roles with significant risk to life (e.g., front lines, active duty) are generally not covered, as insurers deem it too risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>. Administrative roles with negligible risk can be covered, though documentation might be more cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>.
*   **Non-Resident Indians (NRIs)**:
    *   An Indian term insurance policy remains valid even if the policyholder dies outside India, provided it's not due to exclusions like criminal activity or suicide within the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.
    *   NRIs can purchase policies from India, but medical tests abroad can be challenging and costly. It's often recommended to get tests done while in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>.
    *   Death in war zones or cases of missing persons can complicate claims, requiring specific procedures and potentially lengthy investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>.

### Marketing Gimmicks

*   **Zero-Cost Term Insurance**: This plan promises to return all premiums (excluding GST) if the policy is surrendered after a certain period (e.g., 35-40 years). However, it often requires maintaining the policy for a longer tenure than might be necessary, leading to higher overall premiums, and the returned amount's value is diminished by inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>.
*   **Return of Premium (ROP) Plans**: These plans guarantee the return of premiums at the end of the policy term if the policyholder survives. However, they come with significantly higher premiums than standard term plans, making them generally less financially sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.

### Recent Premium Increases

Term insurance premiums have generally increased over the past few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
*   **COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic led to unexpected mortality rates, forcing insurers and their reinsurers to re-evaluate their risk models and compensate for increased payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>.
*   **Evolving Regulations**: Regulator (IRDAI) efforts to make policies more customer-friendly by removing exclusions (e.g., death in war zones) mean higher costs for insurers, which are passed on through revised premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>.
*   **Age and Locking in Price**: Premiums increase with age (e.g., a 4% jump between 44 and 45 years old) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:28:11">[01:28:11]</a>. It is always better to lock in the price today by purchasing a term policy when younger to avoid constantly paying higher premiums later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>.

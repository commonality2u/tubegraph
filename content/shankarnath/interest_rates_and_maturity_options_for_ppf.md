The Public Provident Fund (PPF) is a highly popular investment scheme known for its long-term investment horizon, guaranteed returns, and tax-free status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Over 250 million PPF accounts have been opened since its introduction in 1968, holding approximately 14 lakh crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## PPF Interest Rates

The interest rate offered on the Public Provident Fund scheme is assured by the Government of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. However, this rate is not fixed; it is reviewed and potentially revised every three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. The PPF interest rate is linked to the yield on a 10-year Government of India bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. Historically, these bond yields have decreased from 15% to about 7% over the last 30 years, which explains the corresponding decline in PPF interest rates over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

It is important to evaluate PPF interest rates, and any [[Fixed income investment options for retail investors | fixed income instrument]], in relation to the country's prevailing inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. For example, in the 1990s, PPF rates were static at 12%, but inflation was also high at 10.5-11%, meaning subscribers earned a real return of only 1-1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

### Interest Calculation

Interest on a PPF balance is calculated monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. This calculation is based on the lowest balance in the account between the 5th and the end of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. To ensure interest is earned for a given month, deposits should be made by the 5th of that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. Even if an account is flagged as inactive due to missed minimum contributions, it will continue to receive interest on its balance at the prevailing rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

## PPF Maturity Options

A PPF account has a maturity period of 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. This 15-year period is calculated from the end of the financial year in which the first deposit was made, not from the date of account opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. For instance, if the first contribution is made on May 17, 2020, the 15-year maturity period starts from March 31, 2021, meaning the account will mature on April 1, 2036 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. This effectively results in 16 annual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

Upon maturity, a subscriber has two primary options:

1.  **Close the Account:** Withdraw the entire balance and close the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Extend the Account:** Extend the account for an additional block of five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This extension can be taken any number of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

### Extension Options

Extensions can be done in two ways:

1.  **Without Contribution:**
    *   The account is automatically extended for a five-year block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
    *   No fresh contributions can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
    *   The subscriber cannot opt for an "extension with contribution" later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
    *   There are no limits to the amount that can be withdrawn from the balance, although only one withdrawal is permitted per financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

2.  **With Contribution:**
    *   The subscriber must submit Form H at the bank or post office within one year of the maturity date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Failure to submit this form while continuing to contribute will result in no interest or tax benefits on the deposited amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
    *   This option allows for the withdrawal of 60% of the balance at the beginning of each extended five-year block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. For example, if an account matured on April 1, 2023, with a balance of 50 lakhs, 30 lakhs (60%) could be withdrawn over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
    *   Only one withdrawal is allowed in each financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
    *   Once this option is chosen, it cannot be reverted to the "without contribution" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

The ability to make annual withdrawals, especially with extensions without contribution, can allow PPF to function as a tax-free pension product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. For instance, an account with 50 lakhs extended without contributions at an 8% interest rate would yield 4 lakhs annually (approximately 33,000 rupees per month), which is tax-free, while keeping the principal intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

### Premature Withdrawal and Closure

[[Withdrawal and loan provisions of PPF | PPF subscribers]] are allowed to make premature or partial withdrawals after five complete financial years (from the 7th year onwards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. Conditions include:
*   Only one partial withdrawal per financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.
*   No loans can be taken against the PPF balance going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   Withdrawals are capped at 50% of the previous financial year's closing balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

Premature closure of a PPF account is possible under specific conditions:
*   The account must have completed at least five financial years (closure from the 7th year onwards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   Closure is allowed only on specific grounds such as treatment of a serious illness, higher education, or a change in residency status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.
*   A penalty applies: the account holder receives 1% lower interest rate compared to what they would have received if the account continued normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. This 1% reduction is applied retrospectively from the day the account was opened or extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. For example, if an account receiving 8% interest is prematurely closed after 10 years, all accumulated interest will be recalculated at 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.

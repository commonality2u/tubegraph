Tracking the activities of company promoters can serve as a promising signal for investors, as an increase in a promoter's stake often indicates that the company is perceived as more valuable than its current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This approach leverages the insight that promoters, being insiders, possess a deep understanding of their business and its future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The insights for this [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing strategy]] are significantly drawn from a talk by Mr. Maran Govindaswamy of UniFi Capital, titled "Indian Promoters are the Best Contrarians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Promoters in the Indian Market (Bhat)

Unlike Western markets (e.g., US, Europe, Canada, Australia) where ownership and management are often separate—with institutions owning shares and professional managers running the business—in India, the owner and manager are frequently the same person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

For the top 500 companies in India, which represent approximately 94-95% of the total market capitalization, about 70-75% have a CEO or Managing Director who is either the promoter or someone appointed by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Promoters hold the largest share of ownership in terms of market capitalization, a figure that has fluctuated between 45% and 55% over the last 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. While this percentage varies by company (e.g., TCS, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Adani Enterprises, DLF might have 65-75% promoter holding), the average across companies is around 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Given that promoters hold the biggest chunk of ownership, monitoring changes in their shareholding can provide more valuable information than tracking foreign institutional or mutual fund holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## [[methods_promoters_use_to_increase_their_stake_in_a_company | Methods Promoters Use to Increase Their Stake]]

Promoters typically increase their stake in companies through five main methods:

1.  **Buying Shares in the Open Market** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>: Promoters frequently buy shares this way, adhering to regulatory norms like the Takeover Act and insider trading regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
2.  **Preferential Issue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>: This involves issuing shares to a select group of investors, including promoters, which can be a fast way to raise capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
3.  **Warrants** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>: Warrants give promoters the right to buy a specified number of shares at a predetermined price within a set timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. If the current share price exceeds the exercise price, promoters will typically exercise their warrants, increasing their stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
4.  **Rights Issue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>: In a rights issue, existing shareholders are offered the right to purchase additional shares in proportion to their current holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
5.  **Buybacks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>: Unlike other methods requiring financial commitment, promoters can increase their shareholding by *not* participating in a company's buyback offer, effectively increasing their proportional ownership as the total number of outstanding shares decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Promoters as Contrarian Investors

Promoters act as astute businessmen who understand valuation, buying when the odds are in their favor and diluting their stake when numbers are against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

*   **Buying Behavior**: The highest amount of promoter buying was observed during periods when the midcap index was undervalued, such as throughout 2009 and the COVID-19 months (April to December 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. During these times, over 100 companies saw promoters increase their stake by at least half a percent within a quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Selling/Dilution Behavior**: Conversely, promoters tend to avoid additional purchases when the midcap index experiences a massive run-up (e.g., 2016-2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. They also steer clear of buying during periods of very high mutual fund collections, record FII inflows, strong stock market returns, increased retail investor participation, and numerous IPO launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. In fact, some promoters strategically dilute their stake to capitalize on high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. For instance, in April-June of the previous year, when mid and small caps hit all-time highs, promoters in over 100 companies reportedly sold shares worth more than 16,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

This pattern suggests an inverse correlation between promoter buying and market exuberance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. While promoters may not pinpoint exact market bottoms or tops, they generally have a good sense of when valuations are excessively low or high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

This phenomenon is also observed on a sectoral basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For example, in 2018-2019, the FMCG sector performed exceptionally well with stocks trading at high P/E multiples (50-70), yet there was almost no buying activity from promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. In contrast, during the same period, industries like Auto, Pharma, and Metals performed poorly but saw significant insider buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | Investment Strategies]] Tracking Promoters

The concept of tracking promoter activities has been formalized into [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investment strategies]].

*   UniFi Capital, for instance, has an "Insider Shadow strategy" or Rubic PMS, which aims to build a portfolio of multi-cap companies where promoters are consistently increasing their stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   Nepean Capital also actively examines promoter buying, referring to it as "smart money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Performance and Characteristics

Studies support the effectiveness of this [[performance_of_copycat_investing_strategy | copycat investing strategy]]:

*   A random sample of 30-35 companies where promoter stakes rose by at least 3% showed that, as a portfolio, this group performed exceptionally well, with returns 10-11% higher than the Nifty 500 Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   A 15-year study by Mr. Maran's team tracked companies where promoter shareholding increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. When stock performance was examined over three-year periods:
    *   Approximately 11% of companies showed no movement or even negative returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
    *   14-15% had single-digit returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   In 73% of cases, investor returns were substantial, potentially 20-30% higher than the index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Companies where promoters increase their shareholdings often share common characteristics indicative of financial strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Over half of these companies (56%) were found to have zero debt or a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This suggests that promoters commit capital when the company is in good financial health or expected to be in the coming quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

## Practical Application

While following promoters is a compelling strategy, it's not a guaranteed rule; some stocks may decline or stagnate even after promoter stake increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Therefore, it's best viewed as a portfolio strategy rather than solely picking individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

To implement this [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | strategy]]:

1.  **Extract a list** of companies where promoter holding has increased, for example, by at least 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
2.  **Conduct necessary checks** on financial metrics like the P/E ratio, ROC (Return on Capital Employed), sales growth, and free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
3.  **Shrink the list** to a manageable number, perhaps around 30 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
4.  **Examine each company individually** to identify stocks with the highest potential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
5.  **Finalize the list** to 10-12 companies for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

By shadowing the moves of promoters, who have proven to be shrewd contrarian investors, individuals can potentially achieve excess profits over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This approach can serve as another valuable evaluation point in an investor's toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

Ambit Capital has developed a portfolio selection strategy known as the "10 Bagger Portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This portfolio has achieved an annualized return of 22% over the last 11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. The inaugural edition of this portfolio was released in 2012 and compiled by analysts Gaurav Mehta and Saurabh Mukherjee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The framework has evolved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## The Greatness Framework

Ambit Capital identifies potential [[concept_of_100_bagger_stocks | 10 bagger stocks]] by assessing a company's "Greatness Framework" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This framework evaluates a company's actions to consistently improve its structural strengths over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Six foundational blocks are equally weighted to calculate a company's "greatness score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

The framework excludes financial institutions like banks, NBFCs, and insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, primarily focusing on manufacturing, IT, pharma, and services companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

### Key Factors for Greatness

1.  **Investment (Incremental Capex)**
    *   Measured by an improvement in the capital expenditure to depreciation ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
    *   This ratio is calculated over a six-year period (recent three years divided by the past three years) to normalize results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* Balakrishna Industries, Coromandel International, and Page Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

2.  **Efficiency in Translating Investments into Sales (Incremental Sales)**
    *   Originally considered asset turnover ratio and sales growth in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
    *   More recently, the focus is on incremental sales, measured against its standard deviation to ensure consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* Deepak Nitrite, Gland Pharma, and SRF Limited, which significantly increased sales from FY 2020-22 compared to FY 2017-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

3.  **Efficiency in Capital Employed (Capital Employed Turnover Ratio)**
    *   Measured as an improvement in the capital employed turnover ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
    *   This metric is derived by dividing a company's sales by its average capital employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

4.  **Pricing Discipline (PBIT Margins)**
    *   Refers to the improvement in PBIT (Profit Before Interest and Tax) margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
    *   Ambit assesses margin growth over a six-year block and consistency by measuring it against standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

5.  **Balance Sheet Discipline (De-leverage Ratio)**
    *   Examines a company's de-leverage ratio, specifically how much the debt-equity ratio has been reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

6.  **Cash Generation and Profitability Improvement**
    *   Measured as an increase in the company's cash flow from operations and its consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

These six points form the fundamental blocks of Ambit Capital's greatness framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

### Example of Applying the Framework

Persistent Systems, for instance, received a greatness score of 100 from Ambit Capital due to factors like higher capital expenditure leading to increased sales, stable profit margins, and a significant jump in cash flow from operations in 2021 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This illustrates a cycle where value addition at different stages—improving capex, growing sales, higher profit margins, reducing debt—contributes to a company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## Actionable Insights for Stock Selection

Based on the 2023 presentation, a "great" company exhibits specific quantitative metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>:
*   Sales and cash from operations should grow by at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   Profit after tax (PAT) should grow by at least 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
*   Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) should be at least 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Composition and Performance

Ambit's [[investment_strategies_for_multibagger_stocks | 10 bagger ideas]] are presented in two lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>:
1.  **Within the BSE 500 Universe:** Companies with a market capitalization of at least 5000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. These picks have delivered a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
2.  **Beyond the BSE 500:** Often referred to as micro-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. These selections have achieved an even higher CAGR of 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

The presentations provide specifics on sales growth, return on capital employed, and internal accounting scores related to fraud and governance checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

## Timing the Buy: Valuation

Beyond identifying structurally strong companies, the framework addresses the crucial question of opportune buying times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This involves examining the company's current P/E ratio, Price to Book (P/B) ratio, and EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

A company is considered "cheap" and attractively priced if its current P/E, P/B, and EV/EBITDA are below its historical five-year average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
*   *Examples of attractively priced companies (as of Feb 10, 2023):* Ultratech, Dr. Reddy's, Gland Pharma, Indiamart, CAMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   *Examples of companies deemed expensive (as of Feb 10, 2023):* SRF, Balkrishna Industries, Tata Elxsi, Persistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## Dynamic Nature of the Portfolio

The [[investment_strategies_for_multibagger_stocks | Ambit 10 bagger framework]] is not a "set it and shut it" portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. Portfolio revisions are made annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. Over many iterations, only about 35% of the companies initially qualifying continue to do so over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. Companies that fall off the list can always return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

Out of over 100 companies identified by Ambit's framework, only five have been "consistent 10 baggers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>:
*   Nestle India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>
*   Hindalco Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>
*   Abbott India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>
*   Page Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>
*   Tata Elxsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>

The [[investment_strategies_for_multibagger_stocks | 10 bagger portfolio]] has generally outperformed the BSE 500 ex-BFSI index and top-performing [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | flexi-cap funds]] in most years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

## Summary of the 10 Steps for the Model

To run this model with modifications on a standard stock screener, here are the 10 key considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>:

1.  Identify companies that are incrementally increasing their capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
2.  Look for companies showing consistent growth in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
3.  Select companies that are generating revenue while using their capital efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
4.  Find firms that are improving their profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
5.  Prioritize companies whose debt-equity ratio is decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
6.  Look for companies where cash flow from operations is increasing along with profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
7.  Check every point for consistency by measuring it in two blocks of three years and factoring in standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
8.  Assume that any dividend received from the stock is being reinvested back on the ex-dividend date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.
9.  Perform an accounting check to filter out companies with corporate governance issues, dodgy auditor reports, or high percentages of pledged shares by promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
10. Ensure the chosen stocks are attractively valued compared to their historical valuations, examining P/E, P/B, and EV/EBITDA ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

The list of companies identified by Ambit as having formidable strength should be viewed as ideas for developing one's own stock portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

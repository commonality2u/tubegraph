[[overview_of_index_funds_in_india | Index funds in India]] are broadly categorized, with [[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | sectoral and thematic indices]] forming one significant group [00:01:24]. These are distinct from [[market_capitalization_based_index_funds | market cap based]] or [[strategy_indices_and_factorbased_investing | strategy-based indices]] [00:02:08].

## Overview and Availability
As of the latest count, there are approximately 52 active schemes available for investors to choose from within the [[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | sectoral and thematic index]] categories [00:11:17].

### Subcategories
[[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | Sectoral and thematic index funds]] generally cover several subcategories, including:
*   Banking [00:11:24]
*   Financial services [00:11:25]
*   Auto sector [00:11:26]
*   Information Technology (IT) [00:11:28]
*   Healthcare and Pharma [00:11:30]
*   Realty and Housing [00:11:31]
*   Manufacturing [00:11:34]
*   Infrastructure [00:11:35]
*   Digital [00:02:27]

While these sectors have long been present in actively managed mutual funds, their index variants are relatively recent [00:11:38].

## Performance Characteristics and Cyclicity
[[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | Sectoral and thematic indices]] and the companies they track often experience business cycles, leading to significant highs and lows in their performance [00:11:51]. This cyclicity can skew interpretations of return data [00:11:57].

### Examples of Cyclical Performance
*   **Nifty Realty Index**: This index was the best performer over a 3-year period at one point [00:12:04]. However, over a 15-year period, it became the worst performer [00:12:09]. The real estate and housing cycle in India typically spans 7 to 8 years [00:12:16]. The period between 2012 and 2020 was particularly challenging for most real estate developers [00:12:25]. The Nifty Realty Index was still 45% away from its all-time high achieved in 2008, despite growing over five times since May 2020 [00:12:31].
*   **Nifty Auto**: This index fell by 60% between 2018 and 2020 [00:12:46].
*   **Nifty Pharma Index**: This index dropped by 45% between 2015 and 2019 [00:12:52].
*   **Nifty India Digital Index**: This index remained relatively static from 2015 until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 changed its fortunes [00:12:58].

This cyclicity is a common characteristic across all sectors, though the intensity may vary [00:13:09]. Investors must be careful and cognizant of these cycles when selecting [[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | sectoral or thematic indexes]] [00:13:15].

## Evaluation Metrics
Using trailing returns or even rolling returns may be ineffective for evaluating [[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | sectoral index funds]] [00:12:22]. A higher emphasis should be placed on other related metrics that reflect fundamental business trends, such as:
*   **Real Estate**: Growing order books [00:13:33]
*   **Manufacturing**: Increase in capacity [00:13:37]
*   **Financial Services**: Credit off-take [00:13:40]
*   **Auto**: Increase in disposable income [00:13:43]

## Recommended Selections
Based on their relation to broader mega trends, certain [[sector_based_and_thematic_index_funds | sectoral and thematic index funds]] are suggested for consideration:
*   Nifty Manufacturing index [00:13:50]
*   Nifty Financial Services index [00:13:51]
*   Nifty Non-Cyclical Consumer index [00:13:58]

This combination offers good performance, lower volatility, and decent downside protection [00:14:05], aligning with themes of manufacturing, financial services, and consumer-facing goods and services [00:14:10].

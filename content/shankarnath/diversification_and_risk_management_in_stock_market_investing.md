The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has periodically issued warnings about market conditions, such as the build-up of "froth" in the small and midcap segments, which led to a 6% drop in midcaps and a nearly 10% fall in the small cap index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These warnings, alongside actions on various market aspects including IPOs, financial influencers, and misleading advertising, can create confusion for investors regarding when to invest or exit and whether there are gaps in their [[benefits_of_asset_allocation_in_diversifying_investments | asset allocation]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Nifty Total Market Index: A Diversified Solution

A potential solution to this confusion and a means of achieving broader [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | diversification]] is the **Nifty Total Market Index** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. As its name implies, this index is a combination of large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It is a highly popular investment approach, especially in the US, exemplified by the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX), which holds approximately 3,700 stocks and over $1.3 trillion in assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Comparison with Traditional Indices

Traditional indices like the Nifty50 or Sensex30 represent only a fraction of the total market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   The Nifty50, for instance, represents the weighted average of India's 50 largest companies listed on the National Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. It ignores hundreds of mid-size, small, and micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   While the Nifty50 is 100% large-cap, it only accounts for about 64% of India's total market capitalization, and when considering the Nifty Next 50, it represents roughly half of the Indian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the US, comprising 30 prominent companies, represents only 29% of the total US stock market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

In contrast, the Nifty Total Market Index offers a more comprehensive view by tracking 750 stocks, covering large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. It represents approximately 96% of India's total stock market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This index includes all stocks within the Nifty 500 and the Nifty Microcap 250 indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. It is calculated on a free-float market cap basis, meaning larger companies have a greater impact, but even the smallest companies (e.g., those with less than 2,000 crores in market cap) are included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The list is reviewed semi-annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Enhanced Diversification through Sectoral Spread

Another key difference is the sectoral split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. While the Nifty50 is heavily concentrated in financial services and IT, the Nifty Total Market Index is much more dispersed, featuring companies from 22 different sectors, largely due to the inclusion of mid, small, and micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This broader sectoral exposure contributes significantly to [[importance_of_diversified_portfolio | portfolio diversification]].

## Performance and Risk Considerations

The presence of mid and small caps in the Nifty Total Market Index can lead to higher returns. For example, last year it delivered 41%, primarily supported by the mid-cap and small-cap rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. On average, it offers at least a 0.5% alpha compared to other indices, which over 15 years can translate to a 7% increase in corpus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. A monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of 10,000 rupees since January 2009 would have resulted in a corpus of nearly 1 crore rupees at an annualized return of 14.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

While its direction largely correlates with the Nifty50 (correlation of 0.96) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, the Nifty Total Market Index operates at a slightly lower standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. However, it's important to factor in that with 30-35% of its stocks in the mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap segments, there can be long phases of both underperformance and overperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Therefore, its role might not be solely about maximizing returns or optimizing risk in isolation, but rather about comprehensive market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Applications for Improved Portfolio Management

The Nifty Total Market Index can be utilized in several ways to simplify and strengthen an investment portfolio, improving [[methods_for_analyzing_and_managing_stock_portfolios | portfolio management]] and [[risk_management_in_investing | risk management in investing]].

### 1. Substituting Nifty50 in Portfolios

A straightforward application is to substitute the Nifty50 with the Nifty Total Market Index in an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: It is simple to understand, passively managed, well-[[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | diversified]], and reduces the need to constantly worry about [[benefits_of_asset_allocation_in_diversifying_investments | asset allocation]] for market-cap segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. It also offers slightly higher returns than the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Investment Methods**:
    *   Invest in a mutual fund scheme that tracks the Nifty Total Market Index (e.g., by Grow Mutual Fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   Combine a Nifty 500 index fund with a Nifty Micro Cap 250 index scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This requires a specific allocation (e.g., 9,500 rupees to Nifty 500 for every 500 rupees to micro cap 250 for a 10,000 rupee investment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, making it more complex than a single total market index fund.

### 2. Combining with International Total Market Indices

Another application is to combine the Nifty Total Market Index with an international total market index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, such as a US Total Stock Market Fund of Fund (like Vanguard Total Stock Market Index or VTSAX) or a Developed World Indices Fund of Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: A combination (e.g., 80% domestic, 20% international) can significantly reduce portfolio [[volatility_in_stock_markets_and_its_impact_on_investment_decisions | volatility]] for the same level of return over long periods (e.g., 17 years), thereby improving the portfolio's [[risk_management_in_investing | risk-adjusted returns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This represents a key aspect of [[strategies_for_diversifying_bond_investment_risk | diversifying investment risk]].

### 3. As a Pivot for Long-Term Wealth Creation

The Nifty Total Market Index can serve as a central pivot for constructing a long-term wealth creation portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Example**: Instead of combining multiple schemes (e.g., index funds, stocks, actively managed funds for flexi-cap, mid-cap, small-cap) to achieve a desired [[benefits_of_asset_allocation_in_diversifying_investments | asset allocation]] (e.g., 60-20-20 for large, mid, small caps), one can simply opt for the Nifty Total Market Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. It adequately covers these segments and includes a small exposure to micro-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   For specific allocations (e.g., a 2-1-1 combination of large, mid, small caps), investors can use the Nifty Total Market Index alongside other specialized indices like the Nifty MidSmallcap 400 Index when they become available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This approach contributes to [[key_principles_of_stock_market_investing | improving stock and mutual fund selection]] by simplifying portfolio structure.

## Conclusion

A Total Market Index fund is an excellent option for investors seeking a low-cost, passively managed, and simple-to-understand investment vehicle that provides broad [[diversification_and_rebalancing_strategies | diversification]] across stocks and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. It is currently the truest representation of the Indian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. While its performance is linked to the overall Indian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, it offers a powerful tool for [[methods_for_analyzing_and_managing_stock_portfolios | portfolio management]] and [[risk_management_in_investing | risk management in investing]].

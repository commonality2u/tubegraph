A [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)]] helps an investor manage market fluctuations and average performance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>. It is described as a very popular and effective strategy, practiced by the speaker when investing in equity instruments, particularly mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.

While a traditional [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | SIP]] involves investing a fixed amount regularly, strategies can be layered on top to potentially improve returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

## Step-Up SIP

A Step-Up [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | SIP]] is an accelerating plan where the investor gradually increases their [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | SIP]] amount over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>.

### Methods of Stepping Up

There are two primary methods for increasing the [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | SIP]] amount:

1.  **Absolute Amount Method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>
    *   **Example**: If a monthly [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | SIP]] is set at 10,000 rupees and is stepped up by 2,000 rupees annually, the contributions would be:
        *   Year 1: 10,000 rupees per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:51">[01:36:51]</a>
        *   Year 2: 12,000 rupees per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:48">[01:39:48]</a>
        *   Year 3: 14,000 rupees per month, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>

2.  **Percentage Method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:11">[01:44:11]</a>
    *   This is the more common method found on most websites, where the investor raises their [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | SIP]] by a certain percentage each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:11">[01:44:11]</a>.
    *   **Example**: For a 10,000 rupee monthly [[systematic_investment_plans_sip_overview | SIP]] with a 10% annual step-up, the contributions would be:
        *   Year 1: 10,000 rupees per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>
        *   Year 2: 11,000 rupees per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:23">[02:00:23]</a>
        *   Year 3: 12,100 rupees per month, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:27">[02:02:27]</a>

The Rule of 114 is a thumb rule used to estimate the time it will take for an investment to triple in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:11">[02:46:11]</a>. While not 100% accurate, thumb rules like this are sufficiently error-free and based on real-life situations, aiding in quick calculations and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

## How it Works

To use the Rule of 114, divide the number 114 by the annual interest rate of your investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>. The result is the approximate number of years it will take for your money to triple.

## Examples

### Fixed Deposit (FD)
If a fixed deposit offers an interest rate of 8%, then using the rule:
114 / 8 = 14.25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>.
This means that an amount invested at an 8% fixed deposit will approximately become three times its original value in a little over 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:99">[03:00:99]</a>.

### Equities
For [[strategies_for_building_a_large_financial_corpus | equities]], which are generally expected to give a 12% return over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>:
114 / 12 = ~10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:30">[03:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:11">[03:16:11]</a>.
This suggests that an investment in equities at a 12% annual return would triple in about 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Wealth Building
The Rule of 114 can also illustrate the power of compounding over longer periods, particularly with higher-return assets like equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:40">[03:21:40]</a>.
*   One unit of money becomes three in 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   Three units become nine in another 10 years (total 20 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:10">[03:26:10]</a>.
*   Nine units become 27 in another 10 years (total 30 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:40">[03:29:40]</a>.
*   Overall, one unit turns to 81 in about 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:80">[03:32:80]</a>.

This concept can be applied to long-term financial planning, such as gifting money for a child's or grandchild's retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. For example, if 12 lakh rupees are invested on a child's 20th birthday in an instrument that yields 12% over the next 40 years, it could potentially grow to 10 crore rupees by the time they are 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. However, this is a crude example that does not account for [[Impact of Inflation and The Rule of 70 | inflation]] and other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

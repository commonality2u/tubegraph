The selection of [[Small cap and micro cap strategies | small cap]] and [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | mid cap]] stocks can be approached using a modified version of the "coffee can investing" strategy, referred to as "filter coffee can" investing. This approach adapts the traditional buy-and-hold philosophy to focus on smaller companies, aiming for potentially higher returns over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

## The Coffee Can Investing Philosophy

Coffee can investing is a long-term, generally passive strategy that involves [[developing_small_case_investment_strategies | investing]] in 10 to 15 high-quality stocks and holding them for a prolonged period, typically 10 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. The term was coined by Robert Kirby in the early 1980s, inspired by a client who amassed significant wealth by never selling any of his buy suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Essentially, it's a "buy and forget" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

Historically, this strategy has shown strong [[performance_and_execution_of_investments_in_small_and_mid_cap_stocks | performance]], outperforming benchmarks like the Sensex over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. However, the traditional coffee can method has faced criticism for being "agnostic or ignorant to valuations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, especially when Price-to-Earnings (P/E) multiples have risen significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This highlights the need for a refined approach, particularly for [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap]] and [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | mid cap]] stocks.

## Filter Coffee Can Strategy for Smaller Caps

The "filter coffee can" process is a series of five steps designed to improve the selection process, making it more suitable for [[investing_strategies_in_sme_stocks | SME stocks]] and other smaller companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. This strategy has proven "more than satisfactory" when applied to [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | mid cap]], [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small]], and [[Small cap and micro cap strategies | micro caps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:15">[18:49:15]</a>.

### Step 1: Identification of High-Quality, Well-Established Companies

The initial step involves identifying companies that meet specific criteria for quality and establishment:
*   **Business Longevity:** Companies must have been in business for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** They must consistently generate a return of at least 15% on their capital employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   *Note on Financial Firms:* For banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), Return on Equity (ROE) is a more appropriate metric. Look for a loan book growth of at least 15% and a minimum ROE of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

### Step 2: Filtering for Minimum Sales Growth

From the initial list, further filter for companies demonstrating consistent growth:
*   **Sales Growth:** Companies must show a minimum sales growth of 10% at different points over the last 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
    *   This ensures both high return efficiency and progressive growth in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

### Step 3: Additional Considerations

This crucial step involves several sub-steps to refine the selection, especially important for managing risk in smaller cap investments:

#### Avoiding Overly Expensive Stocks
*   While quality deserves a premium, avoid entering positions or allocating large chunks of money if the portfolio's P/E ratio is excessively high (e.g., above 50 for the portfolio as a whole) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   For individual stocks, prefer companies valued at a P/E multiple that is presently lower than its historical three-year P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. This helps [[tactical_approaches_to_maximize_small_cap_investment_performance | avoid]] companies whose valuations have become unsustainably high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

#### Selecting Market Leaders or Strong Challengers
*   Focus on market leaders or prominent challengers (number two or three) within their respective industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. This ensures the company has a strong competitive position and can persist for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

#### Considering Company Size and Portfolio Type
*   Unlike conventional coffee can portfolios that often focus on large-cap blue-chip companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>, a filter coffee can portfolio can explicitly include [[Small cap and micro cap strategies | mid-cap]], [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small-cap]], and even [[Small cap and micro cap strategies | micro-cap]] companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.
*   There are three types of coffee can portfolios based on size:
    *   **Conventional:** Focuses on large, established blue-chip companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Moonshot:** Includes [[Small cap and micro cap strategies | mid-caps]], [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small-caps]], and [[Small cap and micro cap strategies | micro-cap companies]] with the expectation that some may become "10 to 100 baggers" over 15-20 years, alongside the risk of capital loss in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. This is particularly relevant for [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | small and mid cap stock selection]].
    *   **Blended:** A mix of conservative (large-cap) and moonshot companies, offering both stability and tactical opportunism without active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

### Step 4: Additional Proof of Growth and Sustainability

This step involves deeper qualitative research to confirm the business's long-term viability:
*   **Reading Earnings Transcripts:** Analyze quarterly earnings transcripts and related materials to understand the company's growth plans, capital deployment strategies, and future positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.
*   **Future-Oriented Analysis:** Look for what the company is becoming in the next 4-6 years, focusing on its potential to be a leader or top challenger in its chosen space, even if it involves diversifying into new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.
*   **Qualitative Parameters:** Consider factors like leverage, quality of management, governance standards, competitive advantages, and consistency of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.

### Step 5: Investing and Portfolio Management

The final step involves the actual investment and long-term maintenance of the portfolio:
*   **Portfolio Size:** Aim for a small number of high-quality companies, typically between 10 and 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.
*   **Diversity:** Ensure sectoral diversity within the chosen companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Horizon:** Hold companies for an extended period (10, 15, 20 years or more), resisting the urge to sell due to fear or greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.
*   **Averaging Up:** Consider increasing positions over time, even after a stock has significantly appreciated, if the business fundamentals remain strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Track the *business* of the companies, not just the stock price. This involves reading quarterly earnings transcripts, news articles, and research reports, while avoiding unreliable sources like social media shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. Before [[basics_of_small_cap_investing | investing]], have a solid reasoning for each stock choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

This refined "filter coffee can" approach, with its emphasis on valuation, market leadership, and qualitative assessment, makes the [[small_cap_investing_strategy | coffee can strategy]] highly relevant for [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | small and mid cap stock selection]] today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.

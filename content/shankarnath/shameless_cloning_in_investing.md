The concept of [[shameless_cloning_strategy | Shameless cloning]] in investing was introduced by Mohnish Pabrai, who modeled his partnership structure after Warren Buffett's and frequently leverages the high-conviction ideas of others to generate returns for himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite the abundance of information and investment ideas from numerous experts, a clear, understandable, replicable, and profitable system for implementing this strategy has been lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This article outlines a framework for identifying and packaging investable ideas into a shamelessly cloned portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Sourcing Authentic Information
In the current information-rich environment, identifying trustworthy investment sources is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The most reliable source for authentic information comes from regulatory disclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

In 2016, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated that all publicly listed companies must disclose the names of shareholders who hold more than 1% of the company's shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This rule provides a verifiable anchor for [[using_shareholder_information_for_investment_decisions | investment decisions]] and is a strong indicator of investing intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For instance, an investor's public statement about liking a particular stock can be verified by checking the company's shareholding pattern on the BSE India website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The platform Trendlyne.com also offers access to 80 Superstar shareholder portfolios, which can be used for cloning studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Methodology for Cloning
To create a manageable cloned portfolio from the vast number of publicly disclosed holdings, a specific methodology is employed:

1.  **Selection of Investors:** Ten "Mari" investors (meaning highly successful investors with substantial capital) are chosen who hold a decent number of stocks, with individual shareholdings of upwards of 1% as of December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. These investors collectively hold over 77,000 crores across 370+ stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
2.  **Pruning the Stock List:** The objective is to narrow down the list to around 50 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This is done by focusing on stocks where these investors demonstrate their highest conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
3.  **Measuring Conviction:** Conviction is defined not by the monetary corpus invested, but by the *percentage of shareholding* an investor holds in a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For example, while Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's largest holdings by value might be Titan, Tata Motors, and Star Health, his highest conviction stocks by percentage of shareholding could be Aptech Limited (43%+), Concord Biotech (24%), Star Health (17%), Metro Brands (9.6%), and NCC Limited (13%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This percentage shareholding approach is considered authentic and uncomplicated for testing the thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Simulating the Performance
A simulation was conducted to assess the [[performance_of_copycat_investing_strategy | performance of a copycat investing strategy]] over the last eight quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:

1.  **Data Extraction:** 1%+ shareholding information was extracted from Trendlyne for the past eight quarters and organized in a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
2.  **Stock Codes:** ChatGPT was used to obtain BSE and NSE codes for each stock, followed by some manual corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
3.  **Price Data:** Google Finance was used to extract share prices for 386 stocks across eight quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
4.  **Top Stock Identification:** The top 3-4 stocks per investor were identified using the percentage shareholding method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
5.  **Clean-up and Subjectivity:** Manual intervention was used to determine original investment entry points and investor exits or loss of conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
6.  **Investment Simulation:** A simulated investment of 10,000 rupees was made at each entry point, with the investment sold off at market price to calculate profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Results
The simulation involved investing 10,000 rupees in a total of 57 stocks, totaling 570,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. If all 57 stocks were exited, a profit of 387,000 rupees would have been gained over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This translates to an annualized return of **41.4%** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Benchmarking the Performance
When [[comparing_shameless_cloning_strategy_performance | comparing the performance of the shamelessly cloned portfolio]]:
*   It significantly outperformed the Nifty50, which returned 12.5% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   It also surpassed the best-performing actively managed [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small cap]] fund, the Quant Small Cap Fund, which delivered 29.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   This performance places the copycat portfolio in the top 1% of all Equity mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## [[Challenges_and_considerations_in_cloning_portfolios | Challenges and Considerations]]
While [[shameless_cloning_strategy | Shameless cloning]] can yield impressive results and reduce personal research, there are several [[challenges_and_considerations_in_cloning_portfolios | challenges and considerations]] to be aware of:

*   **Assumptions:** The process involves assumptions, such as the reliance on the percentage shareholding method and the selection of specific investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Data Accuracy & Manual Intervention:** Multiple tools like Google Finance and ChatGPT are used, which may introduce errors such as changed company names or incorrect stock codes, necessitating manual cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Data Delay:** The shareholding information is typically disclosed with a 2-3 week delay from the quarter's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Volatility of Smaller Companies:** Over 80% of the companies in the filtered list were [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small caps]] and micro caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Investors uncomfortable with the inherent volatility of smaller companies should exercise caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Losses are Inevitable:** Despite being high-conviction bets from top investors, 20 out of 57 (35%) of the stocks in the simulated portfolio were exited at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This demonstrates that [[common_investment_mistakes | everyone makes mistakes]], and investors should be prepared for about one-third of their picks not to perform as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Absence of Dedicated Funds
Currently, there are no mutual funds or small cases specifically built around the [[shameless_cloning_strategy | Shameless portfolio strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This is likely due to the difficulty for fund houses to justify a decent expense ratio for a strategy based purely on copying, and it may not align with a fund manager's professional image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

In conclusion, the study supports the claim that [[shameless_cloning_strategy | Shameless cloning]] works, offering a promising avenue for [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing patterns and strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Further research may explore better selection criteria, investors, or tools to refine this replicable and potentially more profitable portfolio strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

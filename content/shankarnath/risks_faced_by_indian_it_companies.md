The [[indian_it_services_sector_growth_and_market_share | Indian IT services sector]] faces several challenges, often referred to as "bugs" within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Understanding these risks is crucial for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Regulatory Risk: Visa Uncertainty

One significant challenge is regulatory risk, specifically concerning the availability of long and short-term visas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Problem:** The issuance of visas has seen a gradual tightening over the years, creating an uncertain and "itchy" problem for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Mitigation:** [[indian_it_services_sector_growth_and_market_share | IT companies]] have responded by increasing onshore hiring and subcontracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Impact:** This strategy, while necessary, is not ideal as it leads to increased costs and reduced operating margins for these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. A balance between onshoring and offshoring is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

## Competition

The [[indian_it_services_sector_growth_and_market_share | Indian IT services sector]] operates in a highly competitive global landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, with competitors from countries like the US, Philippines, China, Ukraine, Poland, and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.
*   **Threat of Replication:** There is always the possibility of another English-speaking, skilled, low-labor-cost country or organization replicating India's success from past decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **New Technologies:** Risks are particularly unknown when it comes to newer technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, machine learning, automation, and microservices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Requirement for Adaptation:** To remain competitive and achieve higher billing rates, [[indian_it_services_sector_growth_and_market_share | Indian IT companies]] must continuously adapt to and adopt newer technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

## Foreign Exchange Risk

[[indian_it_services_sector_growth_and_market_share | Indian IT companies]] primarily earn their revenues in foreign currencies like US dollars, euros, and pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Earnings:** Movements in the Indian rupee against these foreign currencies can have a positive or negative impact on earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** A reported 10% year-on-year revenue increase might merely be a "non-operational benefit" if the Indian rupee depreciated by 10% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Conversely, currency appreciation can also negatively affect reported earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Hedging:** To reduce volatility in earnings caused by foreign exchange movements, most companies utilize various derivative instruments, such as forex forwards and currency F&O contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

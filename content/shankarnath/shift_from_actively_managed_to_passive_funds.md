A couple of visible investing trends are currently underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The first is a gradual shift from [[reevaluating_actively_managed_large_cap_funds | actively managed]] schemes to passive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. People are increasingly inquiring about and investing in index funds and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Emergence of Smart Beta Investing
The second significant move, specific to index investing, is a generational shift from largely market-cap-based investing to a factor-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This is known as Smart Beta investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

The smart beta category in India, in terms of Assets Under Management (AUM), has grown to approximately 22,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and this number is rapidly increasing with new funds being launched almost monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Defining Smart Beta
Smart beta refers to a passively managed investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It combines characteristics such as value, size, volatility, momentum, and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. While the video focuses on five primary factors, there are over a hundred factors to choose from, including standard variables like profitability and sales growth, and even unusual ones like sentiment analysis, cybersecurity, human capital, and social media influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Essentially, smart beta strategies encompass everything other than market capitalization, which is the conventional method of selecting stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The objective of using smart beta indices is not only to achieve better returns but also to improve diversification and reduce [[portfolio_asset_allocation_with_two_funds | portfolio]] risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Approximately 25 smart beta ETFs are currently available for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A few fund houses, such as HDFC, Motila, Losal, ICA Credential (which has the most ETFs in this space), Mai Asset, and KOT, are participants in the smart beta category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Comparison with Traditional Market-Cap Indices
It has been sufficiently established that smart beta indices tend to perform significantly better than market-cap-based indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

For instance, the Nifty50 index has only held first place in performance rankings once in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. It came second in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, but otherwise, it has spent almost 70% of the years in the lower half of the ranking table (positions four, five, or six) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. This suggests that the Nifty50 typically delivers average or below-average returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

On the other hand, the Alpha and Momentum factors have spent only about a third of their time below average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Momentum, notably, has never been ranked last in the previous 19 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

Low volatility is considered a middling factor but has surprisingly seen more first-place rankings compared to momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. It is suitable for investors seeking stability in their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. The [[hybrid_funds_for_risk_management | Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index]] could be a good choice for conservative profiles, offering low volatility with slightly better performance than pure low volatility indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

The Alpha and Value factors tend to have extreme performances, often ranking at the very top (one on seven and four occasions respectively) but also experiencing bad times in five or six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. This suggests these factors can be played tactically by identifying the right moments to enter and exit the index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

Investing in smart beta ETFs and funds is considered a smarter way to create wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

[[GARP Investing Strategy | Growth at Reasonable Price (GARP)]] is an investment style that blends elements of both value and growth investing, aiming to identify companies where growth is underpriced rather than simply finding cheap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Popularized by investor Peter Lynch, [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] seeks to combine the value investor's focus on intrinsic worth with the growth investor's assessment of future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Core [[Growth at Reasonable Price GARP Metrics | GARP Metrics]]

### Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) Ratio
The PEG ratio is a crucial tool in [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] investing, derived from Peter Lynch's book "One Up On Wall Street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. It is calculated by dividing a company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio by its Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

*   **Interpretation**:
    *   Peter Lynch's "magical figure of one" suggests a business is fairly valued if its PEG ratio is around 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
    *   A PEG ratio below 1 can indicate an undervalued business based on its earnings forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
    *   The ratio can be used in isolation or for relative comparison between stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
    *   Modern [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] investors may consider a stock attractive if its PEG ratio is 2 or less, acknowledging a generally low interest rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Considerations**: When examining the PEG ratio, it's important to account for cyclicity in the P/E ratio and to prioritize future growth rates over historical ones for EPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

### Growth Rates
[[Growth at Reasonable Price GARP Metrics | Growth]] is a foundational aspect of the [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth**: Investing in companies with historically accelerated EPS growth has not always been reliable, as growth rates can change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. EPS growth can be unpredictable and subject to manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue Growth**: Focusing on revenue growth is often preferred as it is more sustainable and correlated over time compared to EPS growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

## Additional Fortifying Parameters

To strengthen a [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] approach, other [[Financial metrics for evaluating stocks | financial metrics for evaluating stocks]] and qualitative factors are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>:

*   **Debt Ratio**: Total liabilities divided by total assets should ideally not exceed 25%, as per Peter Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Moats**: The business should possess one or more powerful economic moats to ensure sustainability and protect profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Promoter Shareholding**: A high promoter shareholding is often seen as beneficial, aligning with the advantages of investing in owner-operator businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Circle of Competence**: Investors should have a clear understanding of the businesses they choose to explore or avoid, based on personal preferences and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## [[Different Approaches to GARP Strategy | Different Approaches to GARP Strategy]]

Given that there is no single defined [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP investing strategy]], various approaches incorporate different combinations of [[Evaluation metrics for real estate companies | evaluation metrics for real estate companies]] and [[Business operations metrics in stock analysis | business operations metrics in stock analysis]].

### A Invest.com Screener
This simple screener uses three primary [[Valuation metrics in stock selection | valuation metrics in stock selection]]:
*   **Market Capitalization**: Specifies a ceiling for market cap, e.g., 10,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.
*   **PEG Ratio**: A target range, such as 0 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   **EPS Growth Rate**: A minimum threshold, e.g., 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

This approach also tends to yield stocks with high sales and profit growth, and low P/E ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

### Ish Mohit's GARP Framework
Ish Mohit's methodology, particularly for large businesses (over 50,000 crores market cap), focuses on:
*   **Market Capitalization**: Used to filter for specific company sizes (e.g., large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.
*   **Year-on-Year Quarterly Sales Growth**: A minimum rate, such as 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   **Year-on-Year Quarterly Profit Growth**: A minimum rate, such as 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
*   **P/E Multiple**: A maximum threshold, e.g., less than 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

While this framework doesn't explicitly use the PEG ratio, a significant portion of stocks identified by it still fall within a desirable PEG range (e.g., 0-2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

## Custom GARP Framework (Synthesized)

A comprehensive [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] framework can be designed by combining these [[Growth at Reasonable Price GARP Metrics | GARP metrics]]:
*   **Market Capitalization**: Minimum of 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
*   **Minimum Sales**: At least 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.
*   **PEG Ratio**: Between 0 and 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>.
*   **Sales CAGR**: 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year Sales Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.
*   **EPS CAGR**: 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year EPS CAGR of 15% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>.
*   **Expected Profits**: Next quarter's earnings higher than the previous year's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

This framework often yields companies with high sales and profit growth, diverse sectors, and healthy financial indicators like Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) generally between 15-25% and interest coverage ratios comfortably above three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. The average promoter holding can also be around 55%, indicating strong owner-operator alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the objective of [[GARP Investing Strategy | GARP]] is not to find cheap companies, but to identify those whose growth potential is currently undervalued in the market, always maintaining a long-term investment perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>.

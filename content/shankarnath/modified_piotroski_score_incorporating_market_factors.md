The [[understanding_the_piotroski_score | Piotroski Score]], initially developed by Joseph Piotrosky in a 2000 paper (sometimes called Piotrosky's F-score), is a scoring mechanism designed to assess the financial health and strength of a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It assigns a score from zero to nine, with higher scores indicating better financial standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While valuable, this system was observed to miss crucial elements, particularly in relation to valuations, which determine whether a fundamentally strong company is a good buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Development of the Modified Piotroski Score

To address the limitations of the original score and aim for higher internal investment returns, researchers from BITS Pilani developed a modified Piotroski Score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This modified approach incorporates market-driven metrics alongside financial ones.

### Removed Variables

The modified score removed two variables from the original nine Piotroski F-score criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>:
*   Return on Assets (RoA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>
*   Operating Cash Flow (OCF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>

### Introduced Market-Driven Variables

In place of the removed variables, the modified score introduced four additional metrics aimed at identifying undervalued companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>:
*   Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>
*   Price-to-Book Value (P/B) Ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>
*   Enterprise Value (EV) upon EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>
*   Incremental changes in the firm's Free Cash Flow (FCF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>

These additions represent a clear attempt to identify undervalued companies from a list of fundamentally strong ones, moving beyond the purely company financial basis of the original score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Incorporating Technical Indicators

Beyond the revised 11 financial and market-driven variables, the research team also integrated a couple of technical indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>:
*   **Moving Average Crossover**: Used to identify an uptrend and suitable stocks to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Average Directional Movement Index (ADX)**: Employed to gauge the strength of a trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Effectiveness and Purpose

Backtesting this modified 13-variable approach yielded significant improvements in analyzed returns and the Sharpe ratio, suggesting its potential value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The overall purpose of the [[understanding_the_piotroski_score | Piotroski Score]], including its modified versions, is to provide investors with a systematic approach to evaluate and differentiate between promising and risky investment opportunities by focusing on factors such as profitability, leverage, liquidity, and operating efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Considerations

It is important to note that no system is foolproof, and financial numbers are dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. A high score in one year can change significantly in the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. However, components of such systems can enhance an investor's ability to select appropriate companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

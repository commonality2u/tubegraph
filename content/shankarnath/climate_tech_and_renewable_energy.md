Climate tech, or climate-related businesses, focuses primarily on the restoration of the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Governments worldwide are formulating policies and supporting domestic industries to meet their climate goals over the next 20 to 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:57">[04:20:57]</a>.

## India's Climate Goals and Opportunities
India has pledged to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by 2070 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:40">[04:30:40]</a>. This challenging target also presents a significant opportunity for Indian businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:37">[04:37:37]</a>.

## Key Sub-Themes within Climate Tech
The climate theme in India is built upon several major sub-themes:
*   Renewable energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:33">[04:47:33]</a>
*   Waste management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:29">[04:48:29]</a>
*   Sustainable agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:15">[04:49:15]</a>
*   Water conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:09">[04:50:09]</a>
*   Energy-efficient construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:16">[04:52:16]</a>
*   Clean Air Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:19">[04:54:19]</a>
*   Electrical Vehicles (EVs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:55">[04:54:55]</a>
*   Carbon capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a>

## Focus on Green Energy
Green energy, a subset of renewable energy, shows significant promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:10">[05:00:10]</a>.
*   **Adani Green Energy Project:** Adani Green Energy Limited announced the development of a 30 GW renewable energy plant in the Khavda area of Gujarat, costing $20 billion and covering 538 square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:24">[05:08:24]</a>. This project is set to be the world's largest power plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:50">[05:22:50]</a>.
*   **Energy Consumption and Goals:** India is the world's third-largest energy-consuming country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:55">[05:33:55]</a>. The stated goal is to generate 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based energy by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:09">[05:38:09]</a>. As of February 2024, the country's installed capacity stands at approximately 190 GW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

## Investment Ecosystem and Outlook
The climate theme is expected to support an entire ecosystem, including:
*   Power generation, transmission, and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:02">[06:06:02]</a>
*   The growing thrust towards electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:48">[06:10:48]</a>
*   Pipes, cables, and wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>
*   Smart grids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:04">[06:14:04]</a>
*   Batteries and energy-efficient devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:37">[06:15:37]</a>
*   Manufacturing of solar panels and wind turbines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>
*   Securing raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>
*   Continued research and development for scalable, sustainable, and efficient green energy infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>

Stocks associated with this mega-trend, such as Waaree Renewables, Adani Green Energy, Gensol, NHPC, SJVN, IREDA, and Inox Wind, had a stellar 2023, with most delivering 100% or more in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:06">[06:36:06]</a>. This rally was fueled by the government's ambitious targets and positive investor sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:30">[06:51:30]</a>. There is little evidence to suggest this rally will not continue for several more years, if not decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

### Long-term Investment Philosophy
Analogous to Jeff Bezos's strategy for Amazon, investors should focus on what will *not* change in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. Just as customers will always want lower prices and faster delivery, the planet will not get cleaner on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. For long-term investors, focusing on climate tech aligns with this enduring principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

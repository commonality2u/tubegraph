Smart beta investing is a significant trend, marking a shift from actively managed schemes to passive ones, particularly in [[different_types_of_etfs_and_investment_strategies | index funds and ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This approach focuses on [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | factor-based investing]] rather than solely market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. In India, the smart beta category's Assets Under Management (AUM) has grown to approximately 22,000 crores, with new funds frequently being launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The objective of using [[investment_opportunities_in_smart_beta_indices | smart beta indices]] is to achieve better returns, improve diversification, and reduce portfolio risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## What is Smart Beta?

[[comparison_of_smart_beta_and_traditional_index_funds | Smart beta]] refers to a passively managed investment strategy that combines characteristics such as value, size, volatility, momentum, and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. While this discussion focuses on five primary factors, over 100 factors exist, including standard variables like profitability and sales growth, and unusual ones like sentiment analysis, cybersecurity, human capital, and social media influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. These factors represent alternatives to the conventional market capitalization-based method of stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

There are nearly 40 different smart beta strategies available on niftyindexes.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, this article will focus on the approximately 25 smart beta ETFs that are currently investable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Key fund houses in this space include HDFC, Motilal Oswal, ICICI Prudential (which has the most ETFs), Mirae Asset, and Kotak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Primary Factors in Smart Beta ETFs

### Alpha
Alpha, also known as Jensen's measure, was developed by economist Michael Jensen in the late 1960s to evaluate mutual fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It calculates the difference in a stock's performance compared to market returns, with a higher alpha value indicating better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Available indices/ETFs include:
*   **Nifty50 Alpha ETF**: A portfolio of 50 stocks with high alphas over the last year, passively picked from the top 300 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Nifty 200 Alpha 30 fund**: Picks 30 stocks from within the Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 ETF**: India's first multi-factor ETF, launched by ICICI Prudential in 2020. It combines alpha and low volatility factors to provide growth and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

On a trailing basis, the single-factor alpha indexes have performed exceptionally well, often beating broader indexes like the Nifty 200 and Nifty 500 by 10% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index balances performance, volatility, and downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Historically, Jensen's alpha performs very well in certain years (e.g., 2007, 2015, 2017, 2021, 2023, H1 2024), but can have significantly bad years (e.g., 2008, 2016, 2018, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. An observed pattern suggests a potential mean reversion: a good year for the Alpha 50 index is often followed by a disappointing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

For tactical play, one might invest in the Alpha 50 after a bad year and exit after a prosperous one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. However, a 20%+ compounding over the long run makes it suitable for regular SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. For those seeking above-average performance without wild swings, the Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index is a good option due to its stronger downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Over 17.5 years, this multi-factor index delivered performance close to Alpha 50 while taking lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. All three alpha indexes have demonstrated better returns than market-cap indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Low Volatility
Contrary to the common belief that higher risk leads to greater returns, low volatility strategies can be compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The Nifty 100 Low Volatility 30 ETF has performed significantly better than the Nifty 100 on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This phenomenon gained popularity after the 2008 global financial crisis, as investors preferred defensive, less volatile stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

The low volatility index typically performs well in bear markets, as seen from 2008 to 2011, when safety and valuations were prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. For predominantly large-cap investors, a low volatility large-cap index offers better performance and lower risk compared to the Nifty50 or Nifty 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Low volatility is currently the largest category among strategy-based ETFs and [[factor_based_and_smart_beta_index_funds | index funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Value
The value factor is based on the idea that companies with lower valuations tend to generate higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Value is measured using variables like P/E ratio, P/B ratio, price-to-sales, dividend yield, and buyback history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Value-based smart beta ETF options include:
*   **S&P BSE Value index**: Uses a combination of book value, price, earnings, and sales to derive a value score applied over the BSE large-midcap index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Nifty50 Value 20 index**: Assigns weights and ranks companies based on return on capital employed, P/E ratio, price-to-book ratio, and dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

The value index is an antithesis to growth-oriented factors like alpha and momentum, as well as standard market-cap based indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The Nifty50 Value 20 index has generally outperformed its market-cap based counterpart in most years, though the differences in performance have often been small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. These small increments can add up over time, resulting in a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14.7% for the value index compared to 11.8% for the market-cap index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Value has a weak correlation with momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

While growth stocks have generally outperformed value stocks since 2008 due to factors like high liquidity, low interest rates, and the rise of tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, cycles do turn and can last for 7-8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Research suggests that value tends to outperform when the market is recovering from a bear phase, as observed in 2009 (after the 2008 financial crisis), 2017 (after 2016), and in 2021 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### Momentum
The momentum factor posits that stocks that have performed well in the past will continue to perform well in the future, and vice versaâ€”winners keep winning, and losers keep losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

Within the Indian ETF universe, the **Nifty 200 Momentum 30** is a prominent scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Mid-cap, small-cap, and multi-factor variants are also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

Momentum indices have generally outperformed their market-cap weighted counterparts in both the short and long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This strategy works exceptionally well during rapidly rising stock markets (e.g., 2007, 2009, 2014, 2017, 2021, 2023, H1 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Conversely, it shows weakness during bear markets (e.g., 2008, 2011, 2018, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

A tactical approach for investing in momentum ETFs is to consider bond yields: it may be a bad time when 10-year government of India yields are rising, but a good time if yields are coming down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Momentum can also be applied over the long term through SIPs and tactical lumpsum investments using ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### Quality
Unlike other factors, there's less consensus on the exact definition of "quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. However, it generally refers to a company that is highly profitable, possesses a strong balance sheet, and has little to no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

There are several ETF options available for quality variants, including those around the Midcap 150, Nifty 100, and Nifty 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. In terms of performance, the Nifty 200 and Nifty 200 Quality 30 have been very close on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Surprisingly, the Midcap 150 Quality 50 index has underperformed its market-cap based counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. On an yearly basis, there hasn't been a significant difference in returns for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Additionally, there isn't much evidence to support the expert opinion that quality offers good downside protection and outperforms in a bear market based on the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Overall Performance and Recommendations

Smart beta indices have generally demonstrated better performance than market-cap based indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

For investors with a conservative risk profile seeking stable growth, the low volatility factor is highly suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. It offers better than market-cap returns and has a significantly lower standard deviation (a measure of risk) compared to other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The Nifty Alpha Low Volatility 30 index is particularly recommended for conservative profiles, as it combines low volatility with slightly better performance than pure low volatility indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. For downside protection, low volatility is the best bet, followed by quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

Looking at yearly performance rankings against the Nifty50 index:
*   The **Nifty50** has only held first place once (in 2019) and has spent almost 70% of the years in the lower half of the ranking table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Alpha** and **Momentum** factors have spent only about a third of their time below average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Momentum has never been ranked last in the previous 19 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   The **Quality** factor is considered "a little suspect" as it has spent two-thirds of its time in the lower half and its performance has been similar to the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Low Volatility** is a "middlesome factor" but has surprisingly achieved more first-place rankings than momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. It is suitable for profiles seeking stability and should be considered for portfolio allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Momentum** has a consistency that makes it suitable for permanent allocation, rather than just tactical play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Alpha** and **Value** factors show extremes in performance, being either at the top (Rank 1 on seven and four occasions respectively) or having bad times (in five or six years respectively) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This suggests they can be played tactically by identifying optimal entry and exit points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This approach may require further research to develop specific [[asset_allocation_strategies | asset allocation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

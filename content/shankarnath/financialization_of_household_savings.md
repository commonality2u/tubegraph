The "financialization of household savings" describes the growing trend of individuals shifting their investments away from traditional assets like real estate and gold towards financial instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This trend is rapidly accelerating in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## Market Size and Projections

According to a 2022 report by CRISIL, the total assets of the managed investment industry in India stood at 135 lakh crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This figure is projected to more than double by 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Assuming a continued growth rate of 18%, India's managed investment Assets Under Management (AUM) could reach 1,000 lakh crores, or $12 trillion, by 2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Drivers of the Trend

Despite significant developments in the investment landscape over the past 7-8 years, the industry is perceived to have only scratched the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Several factors are contributing to this growth:
*   A young and expanding population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   Low current penetration of financial products, particularly wealth products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   Rising incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   Increased [[financial_habits_for_young_adults | financial inclusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   The economy's ongoing digitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   Growing awareness of Capital Market products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Evidence of this shift includes a massive increase in demat accounts, mutual fund AUM, and National Pension System (NPS) subscriptions over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Promising Investment Sub-Themes

For investors, several sub-themes within the financialization of household savings are particularly promising:

### Banking and NBFC Sector
This sector saw a 130% growth in the last decade, significantly outperforming its previous 65 years, and is projected to grow by 14% annually over the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Capital Markets
India's capital markets are poised for substantial benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. This includes:
*   Stock exchanges (BSE and NSE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   Proxies like depository institutions, registry agents, and credit rating companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

### Asset Management Companies (AMCs)
Mutual funds, Portfolio Management Services (PMS), and wealth advisors are expected to be major beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. With approximately 50 lakh crores of AUM in mutual funds currently, this is considered merely the beginning of substantial future activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Retirement Fund Management Industry
As individuals become more financially aware and the proportion of the population over 60 years of age increases, the retirement fund management industry will become increasingly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This relevance will manifest in the number of products, AUM, and consumers utilizing these services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

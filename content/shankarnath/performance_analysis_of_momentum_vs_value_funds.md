When considering a two-fund portfolio, a combination of a momentum fund and a value fund emerges as a highly suitable choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This pairing is surprising to some, as conventional wisdom often suggests combinations like large-cap and mid-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. The rationale behind this specific choice lies in the unique attributes of [[momentum_and_value_investing | momentum and value investing]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Understanding Momentum and Value

Both momentum and value investing are based on identifying market anomalies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, which occur when investors either over- or under-react to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### Momentum Investing
Momentum in investing refers to the tendency of investments to exhibit persistence in their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This means that assets that have performed well recently tend to continue performing well for some time, and conversely, those that have performed poorly tend to continue doing so, at least in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This concept can seem counterintuitive to those who believe in buying low and selling high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

### Value Investing
Value investing focuses on identifying assets that are priced significantly lower than their true worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The value factor identifies this gap between the current market price and the intrinsic value of an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. A value investor typically focuses on in-depth research and adopts a long-term perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Key Differences and Synergies
While both [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum investing strategy]] and value investing don't work all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, their investor profiles are distinct: value investors prioritize research and long-term holds, while momentum investors look for short-term price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. A key characteristic that makes them a compelling combination is their negative correlation in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This inverse relationship is rare in equities and can help achieve portfolio objectives related to returns, asset allocation, and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## Performance Analysis
A study examining data from 2006 onwards, using the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index and the Nifty 500 Value 50 index, provides insights into their [[performance_analysis_of_momentum_indices | performance analysis of momentum indices]] and value counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Individual Performance
Over 17 years, both the momentum and value indices performed well independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. The momentum strategy generally led in terms of lump sum and SIP performance, as well as lower volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

### Combined Portfolio Performance
Research suggests that a combination of [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum and value investing strategies]] can yield even better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

#### Equal Weighting (50/50)
A simple portfolio with 50% capital in the momentum index and 50% in the value index yielded an average return of 16.2% over a 17-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This is higher than the returns of more popular indices like the Nifty 50, Nifty Midcap 150, and Nifty Microcap 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

#### Effect of Rebalancing
Applying annual rebalancing to the 50/50 combination slightly improved returns by 0.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Six-month rebalancing further boosted the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to 16.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. However, considering higher short-term capital gains tax rates, the post-tax returns for no rebalancing, annual rebalancing, and six-month rebalancing are likely to be similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

#### Rolling Returns
Historically, the 50/50 combination on a rolling return basis suggests that this strategy can consistently offer 15% to 16% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. The strong [[performance_of_alpha_momentum_low_volatility_and_value_factors | performance of Alpha Momentum Low Volatility and Value Factors]], combined with their opposing nature, creates an inbuilt asset allocation within the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Significant performance differences (at least 15%) between the two indices were observed in multiple years, including 2006, 2009-2011, 2013-2016, 2018, 2019, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

## Advanced Switching Strategies
To potentially enhance returns by leveraging the cyclical up and down movements of these factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>, more complex switching methods were explored:

### Momentum-Based Switch Method
This method involves switching between funds based on the momentum index's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   If the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 index rises by 20% over three months, the portfolio allocates entirely to the momentum index, assuming positive market momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. For example, a healthy move in the momentum index from February to April 2021 would prompt a full allocation to momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, a 20% drop in the index over a three-month period (e.g., January to March 2020) would trigger a switch to the value strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.
Over a 17-year period, this strategy required only four switches, occurring in March 2008, May 2009, March 2020, and April 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. This momentum-based switching strategy resulted in a 17-year CAGR of 22.2%, significantly higher than the 50/50 combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

### P/E Ratio-Based Switching Method
This approach uses the Nifty 50 Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio as a trigger for switching between momentum and value funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   If the Nifty 50 P/E ratio falls below 18, the strategy switches to a momentum-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   If the ratio crosses 24, the strategy becomes more value-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.
This method yielded a 17-year CAGR of 15.1%, which is still considered respectable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
A two-fund portfolio combining [[momentum_and_value_index_strategy | Momentum and Value Index Strategy]] is a compelling choice due to their high individual performance and their weak negative correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. This correlation adds a crucial asset allocation element, allowing investors to potentially improve portfolio performance without increasing volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

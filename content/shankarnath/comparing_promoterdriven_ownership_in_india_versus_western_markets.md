An investor typically has one reason to buy: to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. When a promoter increases their stake in a company, it signals that the company is considered more valuable than its current price, which is a promising sign for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This analysis draws prominently from a talk by Mr. Maran Goind Swami of UniFi Capital, titled "Indian Promoters are the Best Contrarians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Western Markets: Demarcation of Ownership and Management

In Western markets, such as the US, Europe, Canada, and Australia, there is a clear distinction between ownership and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Generally, institutions like hedge funds, pension funds, AMCs, and insurance companies own a significant portion of shares in these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Professional managers are then assigned the responsibility of running the business and maximizing shareholder value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## India (Bhat): Integrated Ownership and Management

In India, the owner and the manager are more or less the same person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Among the top 500 companies, which represent about 94-95% of the total market capitalization, approximately 70-75% have a CEO or managing director who is either the promoter themselves or someone appointed by the promoter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Promoters hold the largest share of ownership in terms of market capitalization, with their ownership percentage fluctuating between 45% and 55% over the last 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. While this number varies by company—some like TCS, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Adani Enterprises, and DLF have high promoter holdings (65-75%), others may have lower—the average across companies is around 50%, which is a substantial figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Significance for Investors

Despite a lot of news and social media focus on holdings by foreign institutions (FIIs) or mutual funds, the largest chunk of ownership in Indian companies resides with promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Therefore, monitoring the increase or decrease in promoter shareholding can provide valuable information about a company's future direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Promoters, being insiders and astute businessmen, understand the importance of valuation and tend to buy when the odds are in their favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

This unique structure in India, where promoters are often both owners and managers, means their actions in increasing or decreasing their stake can serve as a key indicator for investors, often aligning with a [[correlation_between_promoter_buying_and_company_performance | contrarian investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

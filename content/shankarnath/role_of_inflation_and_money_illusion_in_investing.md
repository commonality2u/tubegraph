According to Benjamin Graham, the author of *The Intelligent Investor*, understanding the true impact of money's diminishing value is crucial for investors. First published in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, Graham's book provides practical guidance for building a long-term investment strategy rooted in [[value_investing_principles_in_intelligent_investor | value investing principles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, aiming to minimize losses and maximize sustainable gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Money's Diminishing Value: The Impact of Inflation

Chapter 2 of *The Intelligent Investor* directly addresses money's diminishing value, widely known as [[impact_of_inflation_and_the_rule_of_70 | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Graham introduces the concept of "money illusion," which he describes as a "feel-good effect" that ultimately holds no mathematical value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

For example, an 8% raise might bring happiness and prompt celebrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, but if prices are increasing by 10%, that raise isn't sufficient to maintain purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Graham illustrates this by presenting a choice between an 8% raise in a 10% inflationary environment or a 2% pay cut with 0% inflation; most individuals, due to "money illusion," would choose the seemingly positive raise despite its real-world diminishing effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Protecting Against Inflation

Graham's overarching message is that cash is a "terrible investment" in the face of [[impact_of_inflation_and_the_rule_of_70 | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. To guard their money and earnings from the adverse [[effects_of_inflation_on_retirement_savings | effects of inflation]], investors should consider assets like stocks and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

This protection is integrated into his advice for "defensive investors" â€“ those with a long-term portfolio who prefer an "autopilot" approach and lack time for extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Graham suggests building such a portfolio through a strategic mixture of bonds and stocks, a concept now known as asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This approach aims to counter the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation.

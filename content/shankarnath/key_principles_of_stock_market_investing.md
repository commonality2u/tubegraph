Stock market investing is often presented as a complex subject by various professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, authors like William J. O'Neil, with his book "How to Make Money in Stocks," aim to simplify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. O'Neil's work combines fundamental analysis with technical analysis to help investors identify strong companies and determine opportune times to buy and sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## William O'Neil's Approach

Published in 2009, "How to Make Money in Stocks" foundationaly examines the best-performing stocks over 125 years to identify common characteristics of winning stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. William O'Neil, who started as a retail broker, was among the first to integrate charts into computer analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This background led him to emphasize how to interpret charts and identify the right times for buying and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. His approach offers a dual layer: first, to select fundamentally strong companies, and second, to use technical indicators to predict significant price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This method, known as CAN SLIM, developed in the 1950s, is one of the most widely studied [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investment methodologies]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## The CAN SLIM Investment Methodology

CAN SLIM is an acronym representing a seven-step process or a set of seven rules designed to help investors identify quality, high-growth stocks at an early stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### C: Current Quarterly Earnings Per Share

This characteristic is prominent among winning stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Investors should seek companies with sharply increasing quarterly earnings per share (EPS) on a year-over-year basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. An increase of over 25% is considered a strong indicator, especially if the growth is accelerating and accompanied by similar increases in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For example, Coromandel International showed a 50% sales growth and 86% EPS growth in Q1 2022 compared to Q1 2021, and similar patterns in subsequent quarters of that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### A: Annual Earnings

To ensure quarterly growth isn't a fluke, O'Neil emphasizes examining the annual EPS growth over the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The average annual EPS growth should be at least 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Coromandel International, for instance, had an average EPS CAGR of 24%, which is close to the target, especially if supported by volume growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### N: New

This refers to new products, services, or management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Significant stock advancements often stem from something new, such as innovative products, new market creation, changes in government policies, new technology, or a new CEO <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. O'Neil's studies indicate that 95% of "superstar stocks" in the past century had some "newness" factor contributing to their massive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. An example is Reliance Industries, whose stock surged by over 400% after the introduction of Jio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Investors should identify companies leading industry trends by reviewing their new product track records, R&D efforts, patent filings, and scheduled product releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### S: Supply and Demand

This principle focuses on the supply and demand of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. O'Neil suggests looking for stocks with fewer outstanding shares, as this implies restricted supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. A share buyback program or significant equity interest from top management are positive indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. From a technical perspective, the ideal buying point is during a breakout from previous resistance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This often indicates higher demand, likely from institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### L: Leaders or Laggards

The rule is to buy leaders, not laggards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Investors should target the number one, two, or at most, number three company within a strong and leading industry group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. These stocks typically exhibit high relative strength, good market share, increasing EPS, and strong sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Relative strength compares a stock's price performance to the broader market or its industry peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. For instance, in a group of IT stocks, KPIT Technologies having the highest price appreciation would receive the highest relative strength value (e.g., 99) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The CAN SLIM method prioritizes companies with a relative strength value of at least 80, meaning they've outperformed 80% of other stocks in their industry or market group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This section combines fundamental and technical analysis to identify trending stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### I: Institutional Sponsorship

This refers to the investment of mutual funds, pension funds, high net worth individuals, and insurance companies, who account for a significant portion of market activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. An increase in institutional shareholding is generally a positive sign and can be spotted by examining volume charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Since these funds often take weeks or months to build positions, this offers an opportunity for retail investors to enter a stock early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### M: Market Direction

Being right about the overall market direction is crucial, as three out of four stocks typically follow the general market trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Therefore, stocks should ideally only be bought when the broader market (e.g., Nifty 50) is trending upwards and not when it's trending downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Key highlights for Market Direction:
*   In a bear market, stocks often open strong but close weak, while the opposite occurs in a bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   Investors should analyze price movements, chart patterns, and volumes to gauge market health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   An increase in volumes alongside an increase in share price indicates strong buying interest and a positive market direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

O'Neil also introduces "distribution days" as a measure of selling pressure from large institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. A distribution day occurs when an index loses more than 0.2% of its value on a single day with higher volumes than the previous session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. While one or two distribution days are not problematic, successive distribution days indicate a weakening market, prompting investors to reduce their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. A bull market typically ends after four or five distribution days over a four to five-week span <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Charting and Technical Patterns

William O'Neil's book heavily features charts due to his trading background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. He emphasizes that stock price and volume contain abundant information and signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Among his favorite patterns are the cup and handle, the double bottom, and the flat base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### The Cup and Handle Pattern

The cup and handle pattern is a bullish continuation pattern characterized by:
1.  **Prior Uptrend:** The stock should have had an uptrend of at least 30% before the pattern forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
2.  **Depth of the Base:** Measured from the peak on the left side to the lowest point of the cup, this depth should typically be between 15% and 30%, though it can be up to 50% in severe bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
3.  **Base Length:** The minimum length for the base (cup) is seven weeks to allow for sufficient stock consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
4.  **The Handle:** This is a mild pullback, typically 10-12% deep, lasting about two to four weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. During the handle formation, volume should ideally not be high, as high volume might indicate a serious sell-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The best scenario is a small, smooth, low-volume handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
5.  **Ideal Buy Point:** This is usually just above the peak of the handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. The buying range extends up to five percent above this ideal buy point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. O'Neil recommends buying as close to the ideal buy point as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
6.  **Breakout Day:** On the day a stock surpasses its ideal buy point, the volume should be at least 40% to 50% higher than the normal traded volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Such a spike (100% to 1000% jumps are not uncommon) signals strong institutional buying interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Selling Strategies

A core secret to winning big in the stock market, according to O'Neil, is not being right all the time, but minimizing losses when wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. He encourages investors to cut losses if a stock declines by 7% to 8% from the buying price, without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

The book outlines nine different selling scenarios:
1.  **Distribution Days:** Multiple days with a 0.2% drop and increasing volume signal caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
2.  **Excessive Gain Post-Split:** If a stock rises 25% or more within two weeks of a stock split, it's considered an excessive gain and a signal to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
3.  **Technical Breakdown:** If a stock cuts through its upper channel line after a significant run-up, it can be sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
4.  **New All-Time Highs with Dried-Up Volume:** When a stock reaches new all-time highs but volume is low, it indicates a selling opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
5.  **Poor Relative Strength:** A decline in a stock's relative strength indicates weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. [[evaluating_stock_market_metrics_for_investment_decisions | Evaluating stock market metrics for investment decisions]] like relative strength is key.
6.  **"Lone Ranger" Stock:** If a stock continues to advance while the rest of its industry group is stagnant or declining, it signals a potential problem for either the company or the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
7.  **Closing at Day's Lowest Price:** If a stock consistently closes at its lowest price for multiple consecutive days, investors should be cautious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
8.  **Earnings Slowdown:** A slowdown (decrease in growth, not necessarily negative) in company earnings for two or more consecutive quarters provides a fundamental reason to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
9.  **12-15% Fall from Peak:** A general rule suggests considering selling a stock if it falls by 12% to 15% from its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

The guiding principle for selling, much like buying, is to execute it at the opportune time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

By combining fundamental and technical analysis, the CAN SLIM method provides a systematic framework for identifying high-growth stocks, logically improving the chances of investment success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. This approach highlights the importance of market direction, disciplined loss limiting, and knowing when to realize gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

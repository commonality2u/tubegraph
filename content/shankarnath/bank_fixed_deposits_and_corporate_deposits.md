When markets are uncertain, volatile, or high, and interest rates are likely to decrease, individuals may look for safe places to park their money rather than actively investing additional capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These options serve as waiting areas for funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Both bank and corporate fixed deposits are considered [[fixed_income_investment_options_for_retail_investors|fixed income investment options]] that aid in the [[role_of_fixed_deposits_in_portfolio_management|parking of money]] for a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Bank Fixed Deposits

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) are a primary option for parking money, especially for a [[short_term_investment_options|short period]] of 6 to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>. Many banks currently offer high interest rates on these deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

### Advantages
*   **Safety** Your money is considered very safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.
*   **Liquidity** FDs are liquid, as they can be broken if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>.
*   **Fixed Interest** Investors receive a fixed interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>.

### Taxation
*   The interest earned from bank FDs is taxable as per the investor's marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.

## Corporate Fixed Deposits

Corporate fixed deposits are another option, particularly popular among [[fixed_deposit_schemes_for_senior_citizens|senior citizens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>. Similar to bank FDs, these are offered by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) like Bajaj Finance, housing loan companies such as LIC Housing, and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) like NHI and NTPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:07">[01:32:07]</a>. They can also be purchased from the secondary market using a brokerage account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:07">[01:46:07]</a>.

### Advantages
*   Corporate FDs generally offer slightly better interest rates compared to bank FDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>.

### Key Considerations
*   **Safety** Ensure the paper invested in is AAA-rated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>.
*   **Understanding** Investors should have a clear understanding of the tenure, yield, and taxation involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:07">[01:59:07]</a>.

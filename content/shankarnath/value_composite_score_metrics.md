The Value Composite Score is a fundamental component of the "Trending Value Strategy," an investment approach outlined by James O'Shaughnessy in his book *What Works on Wall Street* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This strategy aims to combine the benefits of momentum investing and [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | value investing]] by selecting stocks that are undervalued and also demonstrate strong price momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. The Value Composite Score specifically identifies undervalued companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

## Metrics Comprising the Value Score

The Value Composite Score is derived from six distinct [[financial_metrics_for_evaluating_stocks | financial metrics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>:

1.  **Price to Earnings (P/E) Multiple** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>: Calculated as the current share price divided by the Earnings Per Share (EPS). A lower P/E multiple is generally considered better for value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
2.  **Price to Book (P/B) Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>: A popular metric, especially for capital-intensive businesses. A lower P/B value is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
3.  **Price to Cash Flow from Operations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>: Helps investors gauge how the market values a company's cash flow generating capability. A lower number indicates a more attractive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
4.  **Price to Sales (P/S)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>: O'Shaughnessy's favored metric. A lower P/S ratio is considered better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
5.  **EV to EBITDA** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>: This metric assesses a company's overall value, including its market capitalization and debt, in relation to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Typically, a lower number is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
6.  **Dividend Yield** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>: Companies offering a higher dividend relative to their share price are considered more attractive. While the original methodology might sometimes use shareholder yield, dividend yield is often a suitable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Calculating the Value Composite Score

The process for calculating the Value Composite Score involves several steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>:

1.  **Define the Universe** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>: Establish a relevant base of companies, for example, those with a market capitalization of at least 500 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This could yield a large number of companies, such as over 1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  **Collect Required Information** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>: Gather data for each of the six [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation metrics]] for all companies in the defined universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
3.  **Download Information** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>: Transfer the collected data to a worksheet for easier management and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
4.  **Allocate Deciles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>: For each of the six variables, rank all companies and assign a score based on their decile. For example, if a company falls into the first decile for P/E (meaning it's among the lowest 10%), it might be assigned one point. If it's in the fifth decile, it receives five points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. A score of one indicates the company is undervalued on that specific parameter, while a higher score means it is more expensive from a [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | valuation perspective]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
5.  **Sum the Scores** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>: Add up all the decile scores across all six metrics for each company. This cumulative score represents the Value Composite Score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. A lower cumulative score indicates a more undervalued company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Application in Trending Value Strategy

After calculating the Value Composite Score for all companies, the next step in the Trending Value Strategy is to filter the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Typically, only companies within the top decile based on their combined Value Composite Scores are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. For example, if the universe consists of 1,500 companies, the top 150 (the first decile) with the lowest Value Composite Scores would be selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

On its own, a strategy using only undervalued stocks (based on O'Shaughnessy's Value Composite 2 indicator) has delivered annualized returns of 17.3% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, the Trending Value Strategy combines this value component with a momentum score, specifically focusing on stocks that have shown strong six-month price appreciation within this filtered group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This combination creates a "techno-fundamental portfolio" that has historically outperformed single-factor strategies and the broader market index, often with lower volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Characteristics of Companies Identified

Companies that rank high on the Value Composite Score and are subsequently selected for the Trending Value Portfolio often display the following characteristics:

*   **Low Valuation Ratios** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>: They typically have a low P/E ratio, low P/B ratio, and attractive price to sales figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Nature** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>: While Return on Capital (ROC) and sales growth may be in single digits, EPS growth can be significantly better, indicating a cyclical pattern of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Small and Micro Caps** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>: Studies in the Indian context suggest that the Trending Value Strategy, heavily reliant on the Value Composite Score, predominantly favors small and micro-cap companies, which can offer high returns but also exhibit higher volatility and drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Prevention of Value Traps** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>: The momentum component of the strategy, combined with the Value Composite Score, helps ensure that these deeply undervalued stocks are not merely "value traps" but are starting to show signs of price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Returns in Bulk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>: Performance from such a strategy may come in spurts, with periods of muted returns followed by sudden spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The Trending Value strategy, which uses the Value Composite Score, is considered a high-risk, high-reward approach requiring a high tolerance for volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. It may not be suitable for growth-stock-oriented investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Ambit Capital, a financial services firm, has developed a "10 Bagger Portfolio" strategy aimed at [[identifying_undervalued_and_high_momentum_stocks | identifying undervalued and high momentum stocks]] that can potentially grow ten-fold in value over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This portfolio has demonstrated an annualized return of 22% over 11 years, converting one rupee into nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This framework focuses on identifying companies that consistently improve their structural strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Ambit Capital's Greatness Framework

Ambit's "Greatness Framework" evaluates companies based on six foundational factors, equally weighted, to arrive at a "greatness score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The framework excludes financial institutions like banks, NBFCs, and insurance companies, often focusing on manufacturing, IT, pharma, and services companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

The six factors are:

1.  **Investment (Incremental Capex)**: Measured as an improvement in the capital expenditure to depreciation ratio over a six-year period (recent three years divided by past three years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Examples include Balakrishna Industries, Coromandel International, and Page Industries, which have increased funds for manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
2.  **Efficiency in Translating Investments into Sales**: In recent presentations, Ambit focuses on incremental sales growth, measured against its standard deviation to ensure consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Companies like Deepak Nitrite, Gland Pharma, and SRF Limited have shown significant sales increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  **Efficiency in Capital Employed**: Measured as an improvement in the capital employed turnover ratio, which is sales divided by average capital employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
4.  **Pricing Discipline**: Refers to the improvement in PBIT (Profit Before Interest and Tax) margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Consistency in margin growth over a six-year block is also assessed against standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
5.  **Balance Sheet Discipline**: Examines a company's de-leverage ratio, specifically how much the debt-to-equity ratio has been reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
6.  **Cash Generation and Profitability Improvement**: Measured by an increase in the company's cash flow from operations and its consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Persistent Systems, for instance, received a greatness score of 100 due to higher capex leading to increased sales, consistent profit margins, and a significant jump in cash flow from operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Characteristics of a "Great Company"

According to Ambit's 2023 presentation, a great company distinguishes itself by:
*   Growing sales and cash from operations by at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   Growing PAT (Profit After Tax) by at least 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Maintaining a Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Identifying Value and Attractive Pricing

Beyond structural strength, Ambit's model also addresses the crucial question of when to buy shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. They examine a company's current P/E ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, and EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. If these current ratios are below their historical five-year average, the company is considered attractively priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

*   **Attractively Priced Companies (as of Feb 10, 2023)**: Ultratech, Dr Reddy's, Gland Pharma, Indiamart, CAMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Deemed Expensive Companies (as of Feb 10, 2023)**: SRF, Balakrishna Industries, Tata Elxsi, Persistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Portfolio Performance and Revisions

Ambit's [[growth_drivers_for_100_bagger_stocks | 10 bagger portfolios]] have delivered a 22% CAGR for BSE 500 picks and a 26% CAGR for sub-BSE 500 selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

The framework is not static; portfolio revisions are made annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Only about 35% of the companies continue to qualify over the subsequent two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Over its history, among hundreds of companies considered, only five have been consistent [[growth_drivers_for_100_bagger_stocks | 10 baggers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>:
*   Nestle India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
*   Hindalco Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
*   Abbott India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>
*   Page Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>
*   Tata Elxsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>

## 10-Step Model for Stock Screener Application

To apply this [[methodology_for_identifying_undervalued_and_high_momentum_stocks | methodology]] on a standard stock screener, consider these 10 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>:

1.  **Incremental Capital Expenditure**: Companies are incrementally increasing their capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
2.  **Sales Growth**: Companies are showing consistent growth in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
3.  **Efficient Capital Utilization**: Companies are generating revenue efficiently using their capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
4.  **Improving Profit Margins**: Firms are improving their profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
5.  **Reducing Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Companies' debt-to-equity ratio is coming down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
6.  **Increasing Cash Flow from Operations**: Cash flow from operations is increasing along with profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
7.  **Consistency Check**: All the above points must be checked for consistency over two blocks of three years, factoring in standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
8.  **Dividend Reinvestment**: Assume any dividend received is reinvested back on the ex-dividend date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
9.  **Accounting Checks**: Filter out companies with corporate governance issues, dodgy auditor reports, or high promoter pledged shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
10. **Attractive Valuation**: Select stocks that are attractively valued compared to their historical valuations, examining P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Potential Companies

Ambit provides lists of potential [[growth_drivers_for_100_bagger_stocks | 10 bagger]] companies, categorized by market capitalization:
*   Companies within the BSE 500 Universe (market cap of at least 5000 crores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   Companies beyond the BSE 500, often referred to as [[investing_in_small_cap_and_mid_cap_growth_stocks | micro caps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

These lists offer specific data on sales growth, Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), and accounting scores (Ambit's internal fraud and governance checks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. It's important to view these as ideas for further research, not direct recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This framework can be valuable for developing one's own [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | stock portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

The Public Provident Fund (PPF) scheme includes provisions for both withdrawals and loans against the account balance, offering flexibility to subscribers under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

## Taxation of Withdrawals

The PPF scheme follows the [[triple_e_tax_benefits_of_ppf | Triple E (Exempt, Exempt, Exempt)]] model of taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This means that not only are maturity proceeds exempt from capital gains or wealth tax, but partial withdrawals and premature closures are also exempt from tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

However, there is an exception:
> [!caution] Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)
> A rule introduced in 2021 states that if a person has not filed income tax returns in the previous three years, a TDS ranging from 2% to 5% will apply on withdrawals beyond a certain limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Partial Withdrawals

Subscribers are permitted to make premature or partial withdrawals after five complete financial years from the account opening. This means withdrawals can be made from the seventh year onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Conditions for partial withdrawals from a primary 15-year account include:
*   Only one partial withdrawal is allowed per financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   No further loans can be taken against the PPF balance once a partial withdrawal is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   The withdrawal amount is limited to 50% of the previous financial year's closing balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Withdrawals During Extension

Upon maturity, a PPF account can be extended for additional blocks of five years, either with or without contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

*   **Extension Without Contribution**:
    *   The account is automatically extended for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   No fresh contributions can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   There are no limits to the amount that can be withdrawn from the balance, though only one withdrawal is permitted per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   This option can only be exercised once per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   This can be used as a pension product by withdrawing the annual interest earned, keeping the principal balance intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. For example, a 50 lakh balance at an 8% [[interest_rates_and_maturity_options_for_ppf | interest rate]] would yield 4 lakhs annually, which can be withdrawn tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

*   **Extension With Contribution**:
    *   The subscriber must submit Form H at the bank or post office within one year of the maturity date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Failure to do so will result in deposited amounts not earning interest or being eligible for tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   Subscribers can withdraw up to 60% of the balance at the beginning of each extended 5-year block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   Only one withdrawal is allowed in each financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   Once this option is chosen, it cannot be reverted to the "without contribution" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Premature Closure

Premature closure of a PPF account is permissible under two main conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>:
1.  The account must have completed at least five financial years, meaning closure can be applied for from the seventh year of account opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
2.  The closure is allowed only on specific grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>:
    *   For the treatment of a serious illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   For higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
    *   Due to a change in residency status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

A "small catch" with premature closure is that the account holder will receive a 1% lower [[interest_rates_and_maturity_options_for_ppf | interest rate]] compared to what they would have received had the account been continued normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This 1% reduction is applied retrospectively from the day the account was opened or extended, recalculating all accumulated interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Loans Against PPF Account

All PPF subscribers are eligible to take a loan against their account balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.

*   **Availability**: Loans can be availed in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th financial year of the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
*   **Loan Amount**: The maximum loan amount is capped at 25% of the account's closing balance from the preceding two financial years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: Loans are charged at 1% higher than the prevailing PPF [[interest_rates_and_maturity_options_for_ppf | interest rate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This loan [[interest_rates_and_maturity_options_for_ppf | interest rate]] is fixed and remains the same throughout the loan's tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Repayment**: Loans are short-tenured and must be repaid within 36 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Penalty for Non-Repayment**: If the loan is not repaid within 36 months, the additional interest rate increases from 1% to 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Protection from Creditors

The PPF Act of 1968 generally prohibits the attachment of a PPF account and its balance for the payment of a debt or liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This means creditors cannot obtain a court order or decree to seize PPF accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

However, this rule does not apply to the Income Tax Authority, which can use the credit balance in a PPF account towards any tax-related order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

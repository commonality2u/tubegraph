Many individuals who have been working for over 20 years often face the challenge of not knowing when they have accumulated enough financial resources to stop working actively for an income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This video aims to provide methods to help calculate this "magic number" for [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Initial Approaches to Finding a Retirement Number

Common starting points for determining a [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement number]] include intuition, where people might arbitrarily set a target from 2 to 100 crores without understanding their future income, expenses, or financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A slightly better approach involves using online [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement calculators]] found on financial websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For example, one such calculator might suggest a corpus of 6.5 to 8.5 crores for retiring at age 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. However, given the importance of this number, more detailed techniques are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The 4% Rule

The [[understanding_the_4_percent_rule_for_retirement | 4% Rule]], proposed by financial planner William Bengen, is a popular technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It suggests that if a retiree withdraws 4% of their retirement corpus annually, with adjustments for inflation, the nest egg should last at least 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Practically, the inverse of 4% is 25 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. So, if estimated annual expenses in the first year of retirement are 10 lakhs, a corpus of 2.5 crores should be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. For instance, if current monthly expenses are 1.5 lakhs, and retirement is targeted at age 50 (seven years away) with 7% inflation, monthly expenses would reach 2.4 lakhs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Twenty-five times this amount gives a targeted corpus of 7.2 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

The rule allows for cost escalation by adjusting the withdrawal amount for inflation each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### [[limitations_of_traditional_retirement_models | Limitations of the 4% Rule]]

Despite its popularity, the [[understanding_the_4_percent_rule_for_retirement | 4% rule]] has several [[limitations_of_traditional_retirement_models | limitations]]:
*   **Inflation Rate**: Developed in the US around 30 years ago, it assumes an inflation rate of 3-4%, which is often inadequate for current economic conditions, especially in countries like India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Universality**: The rule works efficiently for standard retirement scenarios (late 50s or 60s with settled spending) but struggles for younger retirees (30s or 40s) with more flexible lifestyles and higher discretionary spending (travel, dining, socializing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. It is rigid and lacks flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Investment Assumptions**: Bengen's model assumed a 60/40 split between equities and bonds, with average annual returns of 10% and 5.3% respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. These returns are no longer typical in either the US or India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Timing Issue (Sequence of Returns Risk)**: The performance of investments, particularly in the early years of retirement, can significantly impact the longevity of the corpus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. A bad start to an investment journey can deplete the corpus much faster, even with the 4% withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Therefore, a retirement portfolio should prioritize risk management and volatility control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Taxes**: The rule does not account for taxes, which reduce effective withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Economic Changes**: Significant changes in interest rates and inflation since the 1990s make the original [[understanding_the_4_percent_rule_for_retirement | 4% rule]] less applicable today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Modifications to the 4% Rule

Some financial planners recommend flexibility on the withdrawal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. If the withdrawal rate as a percentage of the available corpus increases significantly (e.g., to 6% in the second year), it serves as a warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Moderating the withdrawal amount can extend the corpus by a few more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. While the [[understanding_the_4_percent_rule_for_retirement | 4% rule]] is too simplistic, it can still serve as a broad guideline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Customizable Excel-Based Method for Financial Planning

A more robust approach to finding the ideal [[retirement_planning_guidelines | retirement corpus]] involves using an Excel sheet that is highly [[using_customized_financial_planning_for_retirement | customizable to individual needs]] and addresses many of the shortcomings of the [[understanding_the_4_percent_rule_for_retirement | 4% rule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This method, inspired by Anurag Varu's video, focuses on mapping out future expenses over an entire lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Process Details

1.  **Map Future Expenses**: Detail expense categories and estimated spending from now until age 80s or 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Examples include house EMI, school fees, groceries, household expenses, utility bills, salaries for domestic help/driver, car expenses, insurance, and eating out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
2.  **Incorporate Timelines and Escalations**: Account for specific timelines (e.g., EMI stopping after a few years, child-related expenses ceasing) and annual item-wise inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Include one-time planned expenses like college fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
3.  **Project Expenses Annually**: Map these expenses year by year until the projected end of life (e.g., age 90) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This shows how annual expenses can escalate significantly over decades (e.g., 25 lakhs to 52 crores by age 90) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
4.  **Calculate Total Lifetime Expenses**: Sum all projected expenses, which can result in a large total (e.g., 68.2 crores over 45 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
5.  **Apply Margin of Safety**: Since expense estimation is often underestimated, apply a cushion (e.g., 20%) to the total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
6.  **Factor in Compounding**: The initial corpus will compound and grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. A realistic post-tax return rate (e.g., 8%, considering a mix of debt and equity and taxation) should be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
7.  **Determine Initial Corpus**: The goal is to find the exact portfolio amount needed today for all future expenses to be covered, with the corpus reaching zero at the projected end of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This can be achieved using Excel's Goal Seek facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

The resulting retirement number is a function of expenses, age, life expectancy, post-tax returns, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. For example, it might come to 9.96 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This method, while elaborate, is more accurate due to its detailed cost projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. A downloadable, customizable worksheet is available for personal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

## Simplified Five-Step Process (FYI)

For those with limited time, a simplified five-step process exists, though it is less accurate:
1.  **Years to Retirement**: Calculate the number of years until retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
2.  **Projected Retirement Expenses**: Estimate current yearly expenses and apply a standard inflation rate (e.g., 7%) to project expenses at retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
3.  **Post-Retirement Return**: Calculate the post-retirement tax and inflation-adjusted return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
4.  **Post-Retirement Life Years**: Estimate the number of years in your post-retirement life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
5.  **Calculate Corpus**: Determine the retirement corpus needed to cover the projected expenses annually for the post-retirement period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

This simplified method is linear and does not account for specific changes in expense patterns, making it less accurate compared to the detailed Excel-based method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The Excel method, taking about 30 minutes, is preferred for its precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

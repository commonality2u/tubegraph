*   Strategic realignment [00:17:10]
*   Mergers and Acquisitions [00:17:10]
*   [[using_shareholder_information_for_investment_decisions | Shareholder]] activism [00:17:12]

#### Cupid Limited
An example illustrating the impact of [[management_analysis_for_stock_investment | management change]] is Cupid Limited, a manufacturer of contraceptives [00:17:37]. An investor initially invested in the company in 2021 when it had a market cap of 300 crores and 100 crores in cash [00:17:40]. However, the investor exited their position as the company's growth and share price stalled due to a lack of significant capital or capacity expansion [00:17:52].

Subsequent events revealed clues about an impending [[management_analysis_for_stock_investment | management change]]:
*   During a Q4 FY23 earnings call, the then 78-year-old chairman and MD, Mr. Om Prakash Gar, hinted at a potential sale of his 40% stake if offered 300 rupees per share [00:18:04]. This indicated that the existing [[management_analysis_for_stock_investment | management]] was aging and potentially looking to exit [00:18:29].
*   On September 9th of the same year, the Universal Halasa Group acquired the promoters' stake at 285 rupees per share [00:18:41].
*   The acquirers then made an open offer to public [[using_shareholder_information_for_investment_decisions | shareholders]] for an additional 26% [00:18:51].
*   The stock price, which had been around 200 rupees, surged to 2,000 rupees per share, resulting in a 10-bagger return for investors who correctly understood and analyzed the situation [00:18:57].

This case highlights that recognizing a new, motivated [[management_analysis_for_stock_investment | management's]] potential could have led to substantial profits [00:18:35].

#### Bajaj Group Reorganization
Another highly successful example of corporate restructuring, which often involves [[management_analysis_for_stock_investment | management]]-driven strategic shifts, was the reorganization of the Bajaj Group in the late 2000s [00:13:44]. The group was divided into three separate entities:
*   **Bajaj Auto Limited**: Retained the core business of manufacturing two-wheelers and three-wheelers [00:13:55].
*   **Bajaj Finance Limited**: Took over the financial services segment, including insurance and lending [00:14:00].
*   **Bajaj Holdings and Investment Limited**: Functioned as the holding company for the other two entities [00:14:07].

This well-planned corporate reorganization created substantial wealth for [[using_shareholder_information_for_stock_investment | shareholders]] and serves as an exemplary case of value creation [00:14:14].

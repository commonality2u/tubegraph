[[introduction_to_asset_allocation | Asset allocation]] is the process of diversifying an investment portfolio across different asset classes like stocks, bonds, real estate, and gold, with the primary goal of improving the portfolio's risk-adjusted return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Good [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation strategies]] are process-driven and utilize diversified assets that are negatively or weakly correlated to each other in terms of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Dynamic Asset Allocation

Dynamic [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] is an approach that involves making changes to one's [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] based on a set of predefined rules or algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This model aims to maintain a balance between return and risk by often shifting money between various assets like equity, debt, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

Financial institutions and fintechs, for instance, use stock market valuation levels as an intelligence layer to determine whether to buy more units, redeem units, or simply hold them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Examples

*   **ICICI Prudential Balance Advantage Fund**: This fund uses a dynamic [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] model that adjusted its equity and non-equity asset holdings in 2020 as stock markets fluctuated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. It increased allocation to equities when the market was depressed and pulled back when valuations were high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Risk Profiles**: This [[asset_allocation_strategy | strategy]] isn't limited to general asset classes but also caters to specific risk profiles (conservative, moderate, aggressive), adjusting risky assets towards safer ones, similar to how NPS portfolios are managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Tactical Asset Allocation

Tactical [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] involves making frequent adjustments to a portfolio's [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] based on market opportunities and economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## Dynamic vs. Tactical Asset Allocation

While seemingly similar, there are distinct differences between dynamic and tactical [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]]:

*   **Time Horizon**: Dynamic is more strategic, model-based, and long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, whereas tactical is short-term in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Management Style**: Dynamic is generally more passive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, while tactical requires a much higher level of active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   **Variables**: Tactical [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation]] uses a greater number of variables in its modeling, including interest rates, valuations, inflation, geopolitical events, and market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

### Crafting a Personal Strategy

An individual's personal [[asset_allocation_strategy | asset allocation strategy]] can be a mix of various techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. It is recommended to:
*   Divide different financial goals into separate [[effective_asset_allocation_and_portfolio_management | asset allocation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   Choose diverse assets with low correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   Determine an optimal percentage allocation per asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   Regularly monitor and make adjustments to ensure portfolio performance aligns with goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

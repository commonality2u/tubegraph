## Understanding Moving Averages

A **Moving Average (MA)** is a simple calculation used in [[technical_analysis_and_chart_patterns | technical analysis]] to smooth out price data over a specific period, creating a continuously updated average price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Unlike static averages, moving averages update as new data points come in, shifting the calculation to include the latest information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For example, a 5-day moving average for HDFC Bank would be the average of the last five trading sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Common moving average periods include:
*   15-day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   20-day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   30-day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
*   50-day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   100-day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   200-day (DMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>

The primary reason for using moving averages is that they support the concept of **mean reversion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This concept suggests that if an asset's current market price is significantly higher than its 50-day or 200-day moving average, the price is presumed to revert back to the mean value of these averages at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This allows investors to potentially take advantage of market euphoria or pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Identifying Potential Value Zones

Moving averages can be used to identify "potential value zones" for stocks or indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. A value zone is a specific range around the 50-day moving average where the asset's price often finds support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

When an index or stock price enters this value zone, it can be viewed as a potential buying opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Historical examples for the Nifty50 index show significant dips into the value zone in periods like:
*   2008-2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
*   2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
*   2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>

These instances often preceded excellent returns for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This strategy can be applied to individual stocks as well, with companies like HDFC Life Insurance, Wipro Limited, and Hero Motocorp recently offering value zone opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

While a 50-day moving average might provide fewer opportunities over a long period (e.g., five value zones in 25 years for Nifty50), using shorter durations like 15-day or 30-day moving averages can yield more potential value zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. However, shorter durations introduce more volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. For indices, it's generally preferred to stay in the middle (e.g., 50-day), while for individual stocks, a 20-day or 30-day moving average might be suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Investing Strategy using Moving Averages

Moving averages can form the basis of a systematic [[trending_value_strategy | trending value strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Here are five steps for an uncomplicated moving average strategy, often using the 50-day moving average:

1.  **Identify the Universe of Stocks**: Select a diverse set of 30-50 fundamentally sound companies you are comfortable with, possibly using stock screeners or filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
2.  **Look for Crossings**: Identify stocks whose price has just crossed *above* their 50-day moving average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This indicates an uptrend or a recent bullish turn, signaling potential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
3.  **Invest and Maintain Position**: Invest in these stocks when the price goes above the 50-day moving average and remain in the trade until the stock price cuts *below* the 50-day moving average levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This means investing upon a bullish signal and exiting upon a bearish signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
4.  **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the stock prices and their moving averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
5.  **Diversify Portfolio**: Diversify the portfolio to mitigate the inherent speculation and guarantee no future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Performance Analysis

When applied to the Nifty50 index, a 50-day moving average strategy aimed at identifying optimal investment points has shown a slightly higher annualized return compared to a systematic investment plan (SIP) over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. For example, from January 2019 to September 2023, a 10,000 rupee investment in each of 19 identified months yielded an XIRR of 16.4%, versus an SIP's 16.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

However, the concept of moving averages generally [[moving_averages_and_their_application_in_stock_markets | works better on stocks]] rather than on broad indices like the Nifty50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Applied to a small grouping of five stocks from different industries, the moving average strategy yielded a much higher return compared to systematically investing in that portfolio or in the Nifty50 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Golden Crossover Strategy

The **Golden Crossover** is a popular [[technical_analysis_and_chart_patterns | technical analysis]] strategy that uses two moving averages: typically the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

A Golden Crossover occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses *above* the 200-day moving average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This transition indicates that the short-term price trend (50-DMA) is becoming more positive, signaling increased buying interest and a bullish trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:10:07]</a>. It presents a reasonable opportunity for investors to invest in that stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   **Infosys:** Experienced multiple golden crossovers in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
    *   One in 2018 led to a 54% stock price increase over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
    *   Another in July 2020 resulted in a 150% jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

Similar to the single moving average strategy, Golden Crossover strategies perform better with stocks compared to broad indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. When applied to the Nifty50, it yielded an XIRR of 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Additional Observations

### Price-to-Moving Average Gap

The distance between the current price and its moving averages can offer valuable insights:
*   For the Nifty50 and its 200-day moving average, this gap has historically rarely exceeded 19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   Over the last 15-20 years, excluding a few outliers, the gap between the Nifty50 and its 200-day moving average typically ranged between 7% and 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   If this gap becomes significantly higher, for example, 18%, 19%, or 20%, it can be interpreted as a [[valuation_indicators_and_selling_strategies | sell signal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Even if not exiting, it serves as a message for investors to be cautious and potentially wait for markets to cool down, indicating [[identifying_highrisk_market_periods | high-risk market periods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### Checking Market Strength

Moving averages can also provide hints about the overall strength of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. If a majority of companies, for instance, about 70% of Nifty50 companies, have their current market price above their 50-day moving average, it signals that the market is still strong according to technical indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:12:02]</a>.

Overall, moving averages serve as a valuable tool for both traders and investors, helping to [[using_indicators_for_market_entry_and_exit | identify potential value zones]], determine ideal entry points, and gain insights into market sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

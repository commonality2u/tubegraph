## What are Unlisted Shares?

A share in a company represents ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. [[unlisted_shares_and_preipo_shares_introduction | Unlisted shares]] are those that have not yet been listed on the Indian stock exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They are also known as pre-IPO shares or private equity shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Companies with [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] can include:
*   Young, innovative, high-growth companies like Byju's, OYO, and Ola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Established companies with decades of experience, such as the National Stock Exchange and the Serum Institute of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Subsidiaries of larger companies like Jio, Flipkart, Reliance Retail, and HDFC Securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Companies that were once listed but have delisted themselves, such as Otis Elevators and Capgemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Though not listed, these shares can still be traded, often via the Over-The-Counter (OTC) market, also known as the gray market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Trading in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] is not illegal in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The gray market is a network of brokers and dealers who buy and sell [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] for themselves and their clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. It is important to note that these gray markets are not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which means there is less transparency and more risk involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Risks and Challenges of Investing in Unlisted Shares

Investing in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] comes with its own set of [[risks_and_challenges_of_investing_in_unlisted_shares | risks and challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>:
*   **Liquidity Risk:** It can be difficult, even impossible at times, to buy or sell [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Capital Loss:** An [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted company]] might fail to perform or go bankrupt, leading to a total loss of investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Dilution Risk:** The value and ownership of existing shareholders can be reduced due to ESOPs, preferential allotment rights issues, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Fraud Element:** [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | Unlisted shares]] are prone to scams and manipulations by unscrupulous brokers and promoters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Common tactics include selling fake or duplicate shares, misrepresenting financials, inflating prices, or non-transfer of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Middleman Risk:** Investors need to be careful with whom they work, as the middleman themselves can be a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Lack of Information:** There is often very little known about the company, requiring reliance on research reports that may not be credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Price Discovery:** What is called a "price" is often just a negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Investing in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] is definitely risky, considering issues like illiquidity, capital loss, dilution, and fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, it's crucial to factor in potential returns alongside the risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For instance, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) saw a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 79% from its valuation of 12-15 rupees in November 2018 to 185 rupees at the time of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Regulatory Oversight

While the gray markets are not directly regulated, SEBI can be approached for issues like fraud, manipulation, default, or dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. SEBI's jurisdiction and powers over [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] are limited, and it can only take action if there's a violation of the SEBI act, regulations, or listing agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Aggrieved investors can also approach other authorities like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, or the courts in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## The [[process_of_buying_unlisted_shares | Process of Buying Unlisted Shares]]

While specifics may vary by investment mode, there are seven essential steps to follow when buying [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>:

1.  **Finding a Seller** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
    *   Top sources for discovery are [[online_platforms_for_trading_unlisted_shares | online platforms]], brokers, and personal contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

2.  **Due Diligence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
    *   This step involves thorough research on the company, its financials, promoters, growth prospects, business risks, and valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   Some intermediaries may provide PDF reports or details on their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   If meeting the seller face-to-face, ask questions to verify authenticity, legality, important terms and conditions, and the true intent behind the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

3.  **Price Negotiation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
    *   As a retail investor, judging demand and supply can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
    *   Talk to multiple brokers and sellers, sometimes bluffing about your intention to buy or sell to accurately determine available shares and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   Check [[online_platforms_for_trading_unlisted_shares | online platforms]] like stockx.in for sections like "instaby" lists, which indicate the availability of shares and potential for negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

4.  **Signing a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>
    *   An SPA is a legally enforceable document outlining the terms and conditions of the sale and purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   It specifies the number and price of shares, completion procedure, representations, and warranties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

5.  **Payment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
    *   Pay the seller via bank transfer or check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   Ensure the seller has a valid PAN card and that the promised shares are available in their demat account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

6.  **Transfer of Shares** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>
    *   The seller initiates this step through an off-market transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

7.  **Receipt of Shares** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>
    *   If everything goes smoothly, the buyer should receive the shares in their demat account within 24 hours of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   The investor should also receive a share certificate or a confirmation letter from the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

For sellers, the [[process_of_buying_unlisted_shares | process]] is simply reversed: find buyers, transfer shares, and receive money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Common Questions About Unlisted Shares

### Minimum Investment Amount
While there is no official minimum, brokerages generally require 50,000 rupees of capital, whereas [[online_platforms_for_trading_unlisted_shares | online platforms]] may accept smaller sums starting from about 10,000 rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Where to View Unlisted Shares After Purchase
[[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | Unlisted shares]] are held in a Demat account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Each security is uniquely identified by an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN), a 12-digit alphanumeric code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. For example, IN0DJ201029 is the ISIN for API Holdings Limited (PharmEasy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### What Happens to Pre-IPO Shares After IPO?
Once an IPO occurs, [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] become listed and can then be traded on a stock exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. However, investors might need to wait for a specific lock-in or holding period before selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Can NRIs Invest in Unlisted Companies?
Yes, Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are allowed to invest in [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted companies]] on a non-repatriation basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. If an NRI wishes to purchase on a repatriation basis, they must notify the RBI, as such an investment is treated as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), subject to stricter valuation, pricing norms, and higher reporting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. It is strongly advised to consult a chartered accountant before engaging in such activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## [[Valuation methods for unlisted companies | Valuation Methods for Unlisted Shares]]

Finding the fair value of an [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted share]] is challenging due to the lack of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. There are three commonly used [[Valuation methods for unlisted companies | methods of valuation]]:

1.  **Comparable Company Analysis (Relative Valuation)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>: Compares the company with peers or competitors in the same industry using valuation multiples like P/E ratio, price-to-book value, or price-to-sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
2.  **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>: Projects future cash flows of the [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted company]] and discounts them to present value using an appropriate discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This method is more for equity analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
3.  **Asset-Based Method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>: Calculates the fair value by deducting total liabilities from total assets to determine net assets, which are then divided by the number of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

Each method fits a particular industry or sector, and beginners to valuations should research further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## [[Taxation on unlisted shares | Taxation on Unlisted Shares]]

Like any equity product, investors must pay taxes on capital gains and dividends received from [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

*   **Dividends:** All dividends received are added to the investor's income and taxed according to their income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Capital Gains:** Tax on capital gains arises only upon the sale of [[unlisted_shares_and_their_market | unlisted shares]] at a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
    *   **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** If shares are held for more than 24 months, gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
    *   **Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG):** If shares are sold prior to 24 months, gains are taxed according to the investor's income tax slab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Exemptions:**
    *   Under Section 54EE or 54GB of the Income Tax Act, tax on LTCG for capital invested in a startup may be exempt up to 50 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
    *   Sections 54EC and 54F allow investors to save tax on LTCG by investing those gains in specified bonds or assets within a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> Taxation is complex; always consult a tax advisor or chartered accountant before acting on any tax-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

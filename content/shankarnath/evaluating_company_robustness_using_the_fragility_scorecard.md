From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

The Fragility Scorecard is a tool used to understand how clean or dirty a company is, assessing its strength and robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It is a vital component of a comprehensive investment checklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Key Metrics of the Fragility Scorecard

The scorecard evaluates companies based on four primary metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>:

1.  **Equity as a percentage of total liabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>
    *   **Goal**: This number should be high, indicating robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
2.  **Break-even sales as a percentage of actual sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>
    *   **Goal**: Ideally, this figure should be low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
3.  **[[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>
    *   **Goal**: A higher ROCE is considered better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
4.  **Cash flows from operations as a multiple of early debt obligations plus replacement capex** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>
    *   **Goal**: This multiple should also be high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Application to "Superstar Stocks"

An analysis of 44 "Superstar stocks" (companies that delivered over one thousand percent in returns over nine years) using the fragility scorecard revealed valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>:

*   Most of these "Superstar companies" demonstrated robustness, meaning they were not fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   The median equity as a percentage of total liabilities for this group was 63% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   The median break-even sales percentage was a healthy 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   The median [[evaluating_stock_performance_using_financial_ratios | Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)]] was nearly 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   The cash flow from operations (CFO) multiplier for this group averaged 1.6 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Exceptions

While most companies exhibited robustness, exceptions exist. For instance, despite a beautiful arc in its share price, one company called Trend had significant issues with all four parameters of the fragility scorecard, going against the characteristics of a robust company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This highlights the importance of thorough analysis beyond just stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> When conducting your own analysis, always assess a company's robustness or fragility and incorporate this evaluation into your investment checklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

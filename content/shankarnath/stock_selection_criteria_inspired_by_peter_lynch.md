Imitation is often considered the sincerest form of flattery, leading many investors to model their portfolios after successful figures like Warren Buffett, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, or Monish Pabrai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Notably, Mr. Pabrai openly admits to being a "Buffett cloner" and has adopted many aspects of Buffett's investing framework and partnership structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. A 2008 study found that a portfolio replicating Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings over 31 years would have largely outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 11% annually, suggesting that "shameless cloning works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

This article focuses on replicating the successful and profitable investment approach of [[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]], specifically for the Indian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Peter Lynch's Investment Approach

[[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]]'s investment strategy is comprehensively detailed in his books, "One Up On Wall Street" and "Beating the Street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. His approach can be broken down into three fundamental components:

1.  A compelling story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
2.  How to build a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
3.  How to select ideal stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

### 1. The Compelling Story

Peter Lynch is often described as a "story investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. A company's story centers on two key aspects: what the company plans to do in the future and the anticipated results of those actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. A strong story implies high growth expectations, signaling a potential [[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Understanding a company's story requires thorough familiarity with the company, its industry, strengths, competition, and valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. To better grasp these narratives, [[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] categorizes company stories into six major types:
*   Slow-growing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   Large but growing stalwarts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   Fast, aggressively growing companies (among his favorites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   Tactically oriented cyclicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
*   Comeback Kings or turnarounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
*   Asset plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>

### 2. Portfolio Building and Monitoring

While not a strict "buy and hold" investor, [[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] strongly advocated for a long-term commitment to the stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. His practical strategy allows for investors to rotate companies based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. He encouraged diversification across different sectors and recommended reviewing holdings every few months to ensure the company's story remains intact or if significant changes have occurred in the investment thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### 3. Stock Selection Criteria

The core of [[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]]'s investment approach lies in his stock selection criteria, derived from his extensive experience. Eight key areas should be considered when identifying fast-growing companies:

#### 1. Market Capitalization
[[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] preferred small-cap companies due to their extended growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. He famously stated, "Big companies have small moves and small companies have big moves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. In the Indian context, small-cap companies are generally considered to have a market capitalization between 500 and 15,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

#### 2. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
The P/E ratio should not be viewed in isolation. [[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] examined it over several years, comparing it to the industry average to identify undervalued companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

For stock selection, two filters can be applied:
*   Current P/E ratio must be lower than the company's own five-year average P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Current P/E ratio must be lower than the industry P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

#### 3. Earnings Growth
While there's some debate between net profit growth and earnings per share growth, [[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] favored companies growing their earnings at a rate of 15% to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. A selection criterion would involve seeking companies with a five-year net profit Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

#### 4. PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth Ratio)
This crucial ratio compares a company's P/E ratio to its earnings growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The PEG ratio allows for a uniform comparison of companies across different industries, unlike the P/E ratio alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

[[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] believed that a fairly priced company's P/E ratio should be equal to its growth rate, meaning companies with a PEG ratio of less than one are generally undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. He also used a dividend-adjusted PEG ratio, or "Peggy," where companies with a Peggy of less than one are flagged as undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A conservative Peggy of 0.75 can be used in screeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

#### 5. Strong Balance Sheet (Debt)
[[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] emphasized a strong balance sheet, specifically referring to the amount of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. A debt ratio of less than 25% is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. However, this rule may not apply to financial companies (like banks and NBFCs) or capital-intensive industries (like power, transport, steel), which naturally carry higher debt levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

#### 6. Institutional Ownership
[[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] preferred companies with low institutional ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. A filter for this criterion would look for companies where the combined percentage of domestic and foreign institutional holding is less than 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

#### 7. Preferred Business Characteristics
Based on his experience from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, [[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] favored certain business characteristics:
*   Companies with boring names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>
*   Companies operating in boring industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
*   Spin-off companies (as they receive little attention) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
*   Niche companies controlling large market segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
*   Companies whose products are consistently in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>
*   Presence of insider buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>

#### 8. Avoided Business Characteristics
Conversely, [[peter_lynchs_investing_strategy | Peter Lynch]] generally avoided:
*   "Hot stocks" in "hot industries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>
*   Companies with big, unproven plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>
*   Profitable companies diversifying through acquisitions (which he called "diversification") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   Companies where a single customer accounts for 25% to 50% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>

## Applying the Criteria: A Screener Example

By applying six of these eight criteria (excluding the more subjective preference-based points 7 and 8) to a stock screener like Screener.in, a potential list of fast-growing companies available at reasonable valuations can be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Starting with approximately 1,000 small-cap companies, applying filters for market cap, P/E ratio, and earnings growth significantly narrows the universe:
*   Initial small-cap universe: ~1040 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>
*   After two P/E ratio filters (industry and historical 5-year average): 234 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   After 15% earnings growth rule: 123 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>
*   After a conservative Peggy ratio of 0.75: 102 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>

Incorporating other filters like Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) could further refine the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. When a similar set of criteria was applied, it yielded a list of 32 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This smaller portfolio of 32 stocks demonstrated impressive median characteristics:
*   Median EV to EBITDA: 5.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>
*   Median five-year sales growth: 12.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
*   Median operating margin: 17.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>

Remarkably, this small portfolio delivered a three-year CAGR of 46% and a five-year CAGR of almost 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

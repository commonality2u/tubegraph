When a promoter increases their stake in a company, it signals that the company is perceived as more valuable than its current market price [00:00:13]. This event can be utilized as an [[investment_strategies_based_on_tracking_promoter_activities | investing strategy]], drawing insights from various studies and a talk by Mr. Maran Goind Swami of UniFi Capital titled "Indian promoters are the best contrarians" [00:00:29].

## Promoter Ownership in India vs. Western Markets

In Western markets like the US, Europe, Canada, and Australia, there's a clear distinction between ownership and management [00:01:03]. Institutions such as hedge funds, pension funds, AMCs, and insurance companies typically own a significant portion of shares, while professional managers are tasked with running the business and maximizing shareholder value [00:01:13].

However, in India ("Bharat"), the owner and the manager are often the same person [00:01:27]. For instance, among the top 500 companies (representing 94-95% of the total market capitalization), 70-75% have a CEO or managing director who is either the promoter themselves or appointed by them [00:01:33]. Promoters hold the largest share of ownership by market capitalization, with their stake fluctuating between 45% and 55% over the past 10-15 years [00:01:48]. While this percentage varies by company—some, like TCS, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Adani Enterprises, and DLF, have 65-75% promoter holding—the average across companies is around 50% [00:02:01]. Despite the frequent news on foreign institutional investor (FII) holdings, promoters hold the biggest chunk of ownership, making their buying or selling activity a valuable indicator of future direction [00:02:33].

## [[methods_promoters_use_to_increase_their_stake_in_a_company | Methods Promoters Use to Increase Their Stake]]

Promoters typically increase their stake in companies through five methods:

1.  **Buying Shares in the Open Market** Promoters buy shares in the open market, adhering to regulatory norms like the Takeover Act and insider trading regulations [00:02:58].
2.  **Preferential Issue** A preferential issue to a select group of investors, including promoters, can be a rapid way to raise capital [00:03:13].
3.  **Warrants** Warrants grant promoters the right to buy a specified number of shares at a predetermined price within a set timeframe. If the current share price exceeds the exercise price, promoters will typically exercise their warrants, increasing their stake [00:03:22].
4.  **Rights Issue** Promoters can increase their stake by participating in rights issues, which are explained in more detail in a previous video [00:03:42].
5.  **Buybacks** Unlike other methods that require new capital commitment, promoters can increase their shareholding by *not* participating in a company buyback [00:04:06]. This method has offered retail investors profit opportunities, such as with TCS and Suvani Ceramics buybacks, potentially yielding 10-20% profits in a single month [00:04:17].

## Promoters as Contrarian Investors

Promoters are shrewd businesspeople who understand valuation [00:04:56]. They tend to buy shares when the odds are in their favor and are willing to dilute their stake when numbers are against them [00:05:02].

There's an [[correlation_between_promoter_buying_and_company_performance | inverse correlation between promoter buying and market conditions]] [00:05:38]:
*   **Buying Activity**: The highest amount of promoter buying occurred when the midcap index was cheap, such as in 2009 and during the COVID-19 months (April to December 2020) [00:05:08]. During these periods, over 100 companies saw promoters increase their stake by at least 0.5% within a quarter [00:05:21].
*   **Staying Away/Selling**: Promoters generally avoid buying when mutual fund collections are high, FII inflow numbers are at all-time highs, stock market returns are extremely strong, retail investor participation has surged, and many IPOs are being launched [00:05:42].
    *   Some promoters cleverly dilute their stake by leveraging high valuations [00:06:03]. For example, in April-June of the previous year, when mid and small caps reached all-time highs, promoters of over 100 companies reportedly sold shares worth more than ₹16,000 crores [00:06:10]. This included promoters of HDFC AMC, Vedant Fashions, Coforge, TD Power, and MTAR Technologies [00:06:23].
    *   While promoters don't know the exact market bottom or peak, they generally have a good sense of when valuations are excessive or depressed [00:06:40].

This phenomenon is also evident on a sectoral basis [00:06:50]:
*   **FMCG Sector**: In 2018-2019, when the FMCG sector performed exceptionally well with P/E multiples of 50-70, there was virtually no buying activity from promoters, even as retail investors were happy to invest [00:06:55].
*   **Auto, Pharma, and Metals Sectors**: During the same period, these industries performed poorly, but a significant amount of insider buying was observed [00:07:10].

## [[investment_strategies_based_on_tracking_promoter_activities | Investment Strategies Based on Tracking Promoter Activities]]

Following promoter activity can be a viable investment strategy, though it's not commonly seen in mutual funds [00:07:22]. UniFi Capital, for instance, has an "Insider Shadow strategy" or a "Rubic PMS" with the objective to "build a portfolio of multicap companies where promoters are gradually increasing their stakes" [00:07:35]. Similarly, Nepean Capital actively monitors promoter buying, terming it "smart money" [00:07:54].

Studies support the effectiveness of this strategy:
*   A random sample of 30-35 companies where promoter stakes increased by at least 3% performed "exceedingly well" as a portfolio, with returns 10-11% higher than the Nifty 500 Index [00:08:03].
*   A 15-year study by Mr. Maran's team, tracking companies with increased promoter shareholding, examined stock performance over three-year periods [00:08:21]:
    *   11% of companies showed no movement or negative returns [00:08:32].
    *   14-15% had single-digit returns [00:08:43].
    *   73% of cases yielded substantial investor returns, estimated to be 20-30% higher than the index during the same period [00:08:48].

Companies where promoters increase their shareholdings often share common characteristics indicating financial strength [00:09:05]:
*   In one study, over half (56%) of such companies had zero debt or a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 0.5 [00:09:15]. This suggests promoters commit money when a company is in good financial shape or is expected to be [00:09:45].

## Considerations for [[investment_strategies_based_on_tracking_promoter_activities | Investment Strategies]]

While tracking promoters offers a better sense of timing and indicates financially sound companies, it's not a foolproof strategy [00:09:54]. There are instances where stock prices continue to decline even after promoters increase their stake, or where the stock shows no significant movement for one to three years [00:09:57].

Therefore, this strategy should be viewed as a portfolio approach rather than for picking individual stocks [00:10:14]. An effective method would be to:
1.  Extract a list of companies where promoter holding has increased by, for example, 1% [00:10:20].
2.  Conduct necessary checks on metrics like P/E ratio, ROC, sales growth, and free cash flow [00:10:27].
3.  Shrink the list to about 30 companies [00:10:33].
4.  Examine each company individually to identify those with the highest chance of success [00:10:37].
5.  Finalize the list to 10-12 companies suitable for investment [00:10:42].

By shadowing the moves of promoters, who have proven themselves to be smart contrarian investors, one can potentially make excess profits over the long term [00:10:49]. This serves as another valuable evaluation point in an investor's toolkit [00:11:03].

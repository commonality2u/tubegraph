This article revisits a "shameless cloning" investment methodology, specifically analyzing the impact of different holding periods on investment performance. The initial strategy, while successful, was deemed complicated and difficult to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. A revised [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | copycat investing strategy]] was developed with two major changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Original Shameless Cloning Strategy

The original strategy involved selecting stocks from approximately 10 market investors who held at least 1% of a company's outstanding shares as of December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Top three to five stocks from each investor were chosen, resulting in a list of 57 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Entry and exit points were simulated at the end of every quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Despite its shortcomings, this strategy delivered an annualized return of 41.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. However, this measurement was taken during a bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a> and the strategy was considered complicated and hard to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Revised Copycat Investing Strategy

The revised [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing strategy]] introduced two major changes:

1.  **Real-Time Data Usage**: Unlike the previous version that relied on quarter-end disclosures, the revised strategy uses real-time buying information reported to the exchange on the same or next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This includes large volume transaction disclosures like:
    *   **Bulk deals**: An investor buys or sells at least 0.5% of a company's total shares in a single trading session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Block deals**: A pre-arranged trade involving at least 500,000 shares or ₹10 crores in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Insider trading**: Buying or selling shares based on non-public, price-sensitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
    *   **SAST disclosure rules**: Applicable when someone acquires 5% or more in a listed company, or crosses 25%, necessitating an open offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
    This change structurally improves the cloning strategy and addresses timing-related comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

2.  **Fixed Holding Periods for Exiting**: Instead of selling at various points, a "lazier approach" was adopted where stocks are bought when a market investor buys, but then sold after a fixed period (e.g., a couple of months or years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This means proactively selling without waiting for the investor to sell their shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

## Methodology for Analysis of Holding Periods

The implementation involved two parts:
1.  **Extraction and Cleanup**: Identifying well-known investors and extracting buy transactions from April 1, 2021, to March 28, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Low-value transactions (below ₹1 crore) were filtered out, resulting in 93 transactions from 17 investors across 80 different stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
2.  **Analysis**: Examining gains and losses from these 93 transactions based on different holding periods within the four-year review period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Holding periods analyzed included 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

## Performance Analysis by Holding Period

The cloned portfolio's performance was benchmarked against the Nifty Small Cap 250 index:

*   **3-Month Holding Period**:
    *   Cloned Portfolio: 14.5% absolute return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
    *   Nifty Small Cap 250: 5.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
    *   Differential: 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

*   **6-Month Holding Period**:
    *   Cloned Portfolio: A little over 21% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
    *   Nifty Small Cap 250: 12% returns on a rolling basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

*   **1-Year Holding Period**: The performance gap significantly narrowed to just 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

*   **2-Year Holding Period**: The difference widened to an impressive 15%, even after removing outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. However, this period coincided with bull runs (2021-2023 and 2022-2024), which likely inflated the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Holding Scenario

A simulation was also run where all 93 stocks were bought at the time of disclosure and held until March 28, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   Cloned Portfolio: 24.7% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
*   Nifty Small Cap 250: 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   Differential: 5% to 7% performance gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

This 5-7% outperformance appears to be a more realistic expectation from the shameless cloning strategy over the [[understanding_market_timing_and_longterm_investment | long term]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. It is important to note that even seasoned investors, who are being cloned, make mistakes, with success rates barely over 50% and a third of their picks resulting in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Advantages of the Modified Approach

This revised version of shameless cloning is considered a significant improvement due to several reasons:

*   **Real-time Data**: Uses almost real-time data, unlike the previous quarter-end disclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   **Flexibility in Stock Selection**: No restriction on fresh investments or top-ups, moving beyond the previous 1% shareholding rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.
*   **Easier Cash Flow Management**: Utilizing a fixed holding period simplifies cash flow management, which was erratic before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
*   **Realistic Expectations**: Examining rolling returns across periods sets more realistic expectations, closer to 5-7% outperformance over the benchmark index, rather than the previous 41.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

This [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | method]] can be applied immediately and extended beyond individual investors to FII data, mutual funds, or PMS companies to build custom copycat models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. The importance of [[role_of_patience_in_longterm_stock_investing | patience]] in such strategies is implicitly highlighted by the better long-term results.

From: [[shankarnath]] <br/> 

Fund managers are often associated with a specific investment style, such as value or growth investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many managers find it challenging to transition between styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Initial Exposure: Value Investing

The speaker was initially introduced to investing by Professor Bakshi, who taught how to identify gaps between value and price and the importance of a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While this [[momentum_and_value_investing | value investing]] education was helpful, it created an "invisible boundary," preventing exploration of other concepts like technical analysis, growth investing, or algo trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Understanding Momentum Investing

One area the speaker has developed warmth towards is [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Definition of Momentum
In a cricketing analogy, momentum describes Yuvraj Singh's state after hitting five sixes, where he was "on fire" and expected to continue performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. In technical terms, momentum is the tendency for something to persist or continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This means investments that have performed well are expected to continue doing so, and similarly, stocks that have performed poorly are expected to continue performing poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Momentum vs. Value Investing
Momentum investing is counter-intuitive for someone taught in [[momentum_and_value_investing | value investing]] classes, as it suggests investing in a stock that has already appreciated significantly (e.g., 50-60%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Origins and Behavioral Finance
The study of [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum as an investment strategy]] began in the 1990s with researchers like Fama, French, and Jagdish who observed that momentum delivered returns often higher than market cap or value-style funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. One explanation for this "anomaly" comes from behavioral finance, which suggests investors tend to overreact or underreact to information, causing stock prices to shoot up or depress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These distortions tend to reduce over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Momentum as a Short-Term Strategy
Momentum investing is often positioned as a short-term strategy, typically played out over a 3 to 6-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Performance Analysis of Momentum Indices
[[performance_analysis_of_momentum_indices | Momentum indices]] can accelerate returns when stock markets are performing well, similar to a snowball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. However, when markets are flat or bearish, a momentum fund can struggle and even deliver negative returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Key Observations
*   The Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index has generally outperformed the Nifty in most years since 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Notable profitable years for the Momentum 30 Index include 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2021, and 2023 (23% returns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Momentum performance was relatively poor in 2018 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   [[performance_analysis_of_momentum_vs_value_funds | Momentum indices]] perform well during market run-ups but poorly during flat or bearish market conditions (e.g., 2018, 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Index Performance Comparison (5-Year CAGR)
*   Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index: 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>
*   Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index: 32% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   Nifty 50: 16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>

An investment of 1 lakh rupees in January 2019 would have grown to approximately 2.1 lakhs in Nifty 50, but over 4 lakh rupees in the Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Ways to Participate in Momentum Investing

Investors can participate in momentum through various instruments:

### Indices and ETFs
*   Nifty 200 Momentum 30 Index (mostly large and midcap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>
*   Nifty Midcap 150 Momentum 50 Index (entirely midcaps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>
*   Both indices have performed exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   Mutual funds and [[etf_selection_and_investment_styles | ETFs]] are available for both indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   When selecting, consider brand preference, expense ratio (not too high or low), and AUM (ideally above 100 crores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Actively Managed Funds and Smallcases
*   Recently launched active offerings include Samco Active Momentum Fund and Quant AMC Momentum Fund, which use proprietary models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Numerous smallcases are built around different [[advanced_momentum_strategies_and_techniques | momentum strategies]] from research outfits like Right Research, Capital Mind, Weekend Investing, and Windmill Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Comparison: Passive vs. Active Momentum Funds
| Feature         | Passive Momentum Funds (Index Funds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>                 | Active Momentum Funds (Samco, Quant, Smallcases, PMS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Universe**    | Restricted to large caps or midcaps with a defined number of stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> | Broader mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>                                 |
| **Investment**  | Always invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>                                     | Tend to enter and exit the market based on conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>      |
| **Rebalancing** | Fixed and rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>                                         | Can rebalance as required, useful during sudden price shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> |
| **Strategy**    | Use relative momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>                                  | Use a variety of methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>                            |
| **Expense**     | Lower expense structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>                          | Much higher expense structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>                    |

The speaker does not have a view on whether active or passive investing is better but insists on exploring [[momentum_investing_strategy | momentum investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The speaker plans to allocate 12-15% of their portfolio to momentum over the coming quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Advanced Momentum Strategies and Techniques
Beyond basic price momentum, various strategies exist:

*   **Price Momentum**: Investing in stocks with strong recent price performance, assuming continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Relative Strength Momentum**: Comparing an asset's performance to its benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectional Momentum**: Comparing price movement of stocks within the same sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Time Series Momentum (Trend Following)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Moving Average Momentum**: Used by traders and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **52-Week High Momentum**: Assumes stocks near their 52-week highs will continue to perform well in the short term, selected by screening for 52-week high stocks and applying positive momentum factors like trading volumes, favorable news, or positive earnings surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **[[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | Momentum and Value Investing]]**: Combines the momentum and value factors, which are weakly correlated, through an equal (e.g., 50/50) allocation. This combination can potentially achieve around 15% per annum on a 3, 5, 7, or 10-year rolling basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This is considered a valuable strategy for a long-term passive investing portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Dual Momentum**: Proposed by Gary Antonacci, it involves two types of momentum:
    *   **Absolute Momentum**: Compares a stock's recent price performance to its own historical performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   **Relative Momentum**: Compares the stock's performance to a broader benchmark like a sector or index (e.g., Nifty 50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
    These scores are combined (e.g., 50% each) to get a dual momentum score, which is then used to rank and select stocks for a portfolio that is rebalanced periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Samco's momentum fund reportedly uses dual momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

Other mentioned strategies include: volatility momentum, earnings momentum, fundamental momentum, smart beta momentum, and global macro momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

Momentum as a strategy is expected to persist, capitalizing on market trends and yielding significant returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

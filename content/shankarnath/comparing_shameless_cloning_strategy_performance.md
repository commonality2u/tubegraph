The concept of [[shameless_cloning_strategy | Shameless Cloning]] was introduced by Mohnish Pabrai, who himself copied Warren Buffett's partnership structure and frequently leveraged the high-conviction ideas of other investors to generate returns for himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While Pabrai has been generous in sharing ideas, he has not provided a specific method for cloning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This article outlines a systematic framework for identifying investable ideas from others and packaging them into a [[shameless_cloning_strategy | shamelessly cloned portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Performance Overview

A simulated [[shameless_cloning_strategy | copycat portfolio]], back-tested over the last eight quarters, demonstrated an annualized return of 41.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This performance places it firmly in the top 1% of all equity mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Methodology for Cloning

The primary challenge in investment today is identifying trustworthy sources amidst abundant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The most authentic information for cloning comes from regulatory disclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

*   **Information Source**: In 2016, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated that all publicly listed companies must disclose the names of shareholders holding more than 1% in that company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This 1% plus shareholding pattern serves as a verifiable anchor and a strong indicator of investing intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This data can be extracted for free from platforms like Trendline.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Investor Selection**: From Trendline.com's 80 Superstar shareholder portfolios, ten "Maha investors" were selected who possessed a sizable corpus and a decent count of stocks with over 1% shareholding as of December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Collectively, their total holding from just 1%+ stocks amounted to over ₹77,000 crores spread across more than 370 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Stock Pruning and Conviction Measurement**: The initial list of over 370 stocks needed to be pruned to a more manageable size, aiming for around 50 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Conviction was defined not by the amount of corpus invested, but by the *percentage of shareholding* the investor held on a per-company basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This method was chosen for its authenticity, simplicity, and adequacy for testing the thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. For example, using this method for Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's holdings prioritized Apptech Limited (43% shareholding) over stocks like Titan or Tata Motors, which would have been top by corpus amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Simulation Steps

The process to create and simulate the [[shameless_cloning_strategy | shamelessly cloned portfolio]] involved six key steps:

1.  **Data Extraction**: Extracting 1% plus shareholding information from Trendline for the last eight quarters and pasting it onto a Google spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
2.  **Code Mapping**: Using tools like ChatGPT to receive BSE and NSE codes for each stock, followed by some manual verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
3.  **Price Extraction**: Utilizing Google Finance to extract share prices for approximately 386 stocks across eight quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
4.  **Top Stock Identification**: Identifying the top three to four stocks per investor based on the percentage shareholding method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
5.  **Manual Cleanup**: Subjectively cleaning up data to understand original investment dates and when an investor might have exited or lost conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
6.  **Investment Simulation**: Simulating a ₹10,000 investment at every entry point and selling at market price to calculate profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

This simulation, involving 57 stocks with a total investment of ₹570,000, resulted in a profit of ₹387,000 over two years, yielding an annualized return of 41.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Performance Comparison

The [[shameless_cloning_strategy | shameless cloning strategy]] portfolio's performance was compared against market benchmarks:

*   **Nifty50**: The Nifty50 delivered a 12.5% return during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Quant Small Cap Fund**: Even the best-performing actively managed small-cap fund in recent times, the Quant Small Cap Fund, achieved a return of 29.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Although most stocks in the [[shameless_cloning_strategy | Shameless portfolio]] were small caps and micro caps, making Nifty50 not a direct comparison, the cloning strategy still outperformed leading small-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations in Cloning Portfolios

While [[shameless_cloning_strategy | shamelessly cloning a portfolio]] appears to be less work, there are several areas that require attention:

*   **Process Assumptions**: The strategy involves assumptions, such as the use of the percentage shareholding method for conviction and specific investor selection criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Data Accuracy**: Multiple tools (Google Finance, ChatGPT) were used, which might lead to minor errors like company name changes or incorrect stock codes, necessitating manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Information Delay**: The shareholding information is disclosed with a delay of two to three weeks from the quarter end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Market Cap Volatility**: A significant portion (over 80%) of the filtered stocks were small caps and micro caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Investors uncomfortable with the higher volatility of smaller companies should reconsider this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Losses within the Portfolio**: Despite consisting of high-conviction bets from top individual investors, 20 out of 57 stocks (35%) in this portfolio were exited at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This highlights that even expert investors make mistakes, and one should be prepared for about one-third of their picks not to perform as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

It is unlikely to find mutual funds or small cases specifically built around the [[shameless_cloning_strategy | Shameless portfolio strategy]] because fund houses would struggle to justify expense ratios for simply copying, and fund managers would likely not want "copying" on their resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

This study supports the claim that [[shameless_cloning_strategy | Shameless cloning works]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Further studies could explore better selection criteria, different investors, or enhanced tools to build an even more replicable, scalable, and profitable portfolio based on this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Calculating a share's true worth, also known as its [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | intrinsic value]], is a primary objective for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. A proper assessment of [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | intrinsic value]] helps prevent overpaying for a stock and aids in identifying undervalued opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While there's no 100% accurate answer, computing [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | intrinsic value]] involves making an estimation of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Before diving into quantitative analysis, it's crucial for an investor to understand a company's current condition and growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. As Warren Buffett stated, "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than to buy a fair company at a wonderful price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## The Relative Value Model

The [[stock_picking_triggers_using_relative_valuation | relative value]] model is one method for calculating a business's [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This approach involves comparing the financials of a target company with its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Price Earning Multiple (P/E Ratio)

One of the simpler and more popular [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | metrics]] used in [[stock_picking_triggers_using_relative_valuation | relative valuation]] is the [[understanding_pe_ratios | price earning multiple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. For companies and industries with relatively stable earnings, the [[understanding_pe_ratios | P/E ratio]] can provide a decent assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

For instance, among large IT services companies, the current median [[understanding_pe_ratios | P/E ratio]] is 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Wipro trades at a [[understanding_pe_ratios | P/E]] of 19, while L&T Technology trades at a multiple of 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Everything else being equal, stocks with a low [[understanding_pe_ratios | P/E]], like Wipro in this example, suggest some potential upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

An investor might hypothesize that Wipro, currently priced at 417 rupees a share, could at least catch up with Infosys's [[understanding_pe_ratios | P/E]] of 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Using this, a future price estimation can be calculated: 417 * (24 / 19.7) = 508 rupees. This is considered a quick method for estimating a share's [[significance_of_valuation_in_stock_investments | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Other Relative Valuation Metrics

Beyond the [[understanding_pe_ratios | P/E ratio]], other [[valuation_metrics_in_stock_selection | metrics]] can be used in [[stock_picking_triggers_using_relative_valuation | relative valuation]]:
*   **Price to Book Ratio:** Useful when comparing capital-intensive industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Price to Free Cash Flows:** For example, HCL Tech appeared undervalued compared to peers using this metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Historical P/E Ratio:** Analyzing a company's own historical [[understanding_pe_ratios | P/E ratio]] can reveal [[stock_picking_triggers_using_relative_valuation | relative value]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **52-Week High/Low Levels:** Comparing the current price to its 52-week high or low can also provide insights into its [[stock_picking_triggers_using_relative_valuation | relative value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Limitations of the Relative Value Model

It's important to note that the [[stock_picking_triggers_using_relative_valuation | relative valuation]] method has limitations:
*   **Cyclical Industries and Volatile Markets:** It doesn't work well in these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Diversified Portfolios:** It becomes less relevant when comparing highly diversified companies like Reliance Industries with more focused peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Neglecting Qualitative Factors:** This method may overlook crucial additional variables such as sales and profit growth (e.g., Wipro's lacking growth), competitive advantages, and the quality of management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Despite these limitations, the [[stock_picking_triggers_using_relative_valuation | relative value]] model can provide a good starting point for understanding a business's potential worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. It's also conceptually similar to how a terminal value might be calculated in a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, where a business is assumed to be sold at a certain multiple of its earnings in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

[[Contrarian investing strategy | Contrarian investing]] is an [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investment philosophy and strategy]] that fundamentally opposes popular market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While generally following the crowd is a common human tendency, for instance, joining a line of people with the presumption that everyone knows why they are there, in investing, this herd mentality is reflected in strategies like investing in index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Index funds see increasing amounts of money flow into the same set of stocks, often irrespective of their valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

However, common sense suggests that one should buy shares at the lowest price possible, as lower prices lead to larger potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. A low price typically occurs when other investors are selling a stock, which is the essence of the [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contrary mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Core Principles of Contrarian Investing

*   **Opposition to Popular Opinion** A contrarian is someone who opposes popular opinion, choosing not to do what others are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The strategy stems from the majority's behavioral tendency to under-react and then over-react to information, leading to exploitable mispricings in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Buying Low, Selling High** While the popular notion is that a contrarian sells when everyone buys and buys when everyone sells, this is only one facet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The fundamental aim is to buy when prices are low due to pessimism and sell when prices are high due to euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Risk-Adjusted Returns and Diversification** A [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contradicting strategy]] is an effective method for achieving strong risk-adjusted returns and diversifying a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Key Strategies and Techniques

### 1. Portfolio of Losers
This strategy involves intentionally investing in stocks that have performed poorly or experienced significant price declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A consensual definition of a "loser" stock is one that has seen at least a 40% drop in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

*   **Rationale:** The implicit assumption is that these stocks may have been oversold due to negative news, market panic, or short-term factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. There is an expectation of a trend reversal, making these stocks attractive again <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Evidence:** An analysis cited in Professor Ashwath Damodaran's *Investment Fables* suggested that buying the 35 biggest losers over the previous year and holding them for five years could generate cumulative excess returns of 30% over the broader market, and an additional 40% compared to a winner's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### 2. Conviction Change (Analyst Consensus)
This technique involves trusting changes in equity analyst recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. A 2017 report by Motilal Oswal Securities indicated that investing in stocks where the analyst consensus shifted from a "net sell" to a "net buy" could deliver an annual return of 24.1% over a one-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This suggests that a change in consensus recommendations can be a robust return predictor due to new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### 3. Sectoral Rotation and Ignored Sectors
Human behavior often leads to focus on a few sectors, while others are temporarily ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This cyclical "up and down" presents massive [[market_cycle_opportunities_for_contrarians | opportunities for contrarian investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

*   **Example: Pharmaceutical Sector** The Nifty Pharma index historically operated at an average P/E multiple of around 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. However, between 2019 and 2020, due to weaknesses in US markets, regulatory issues, and pricing pressures, the index dropped by 30% and its P/E ratio fell from 53 to 24 within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:07:12]</a>. A contrarian would recognize that the investor community was overstating the risk, making investment in the sector less risky and offering a better chance for good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. During this period, while the Pharma index declined by 20%, its earnings per share (EPS) actually increased by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:08:04]</a>, highlighting the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### 4. Investing in Under-owned and Underappreciated Companies
This strategy involves investing in something that others are not currently looking at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

*   **Example: Eicher Motors** Between 2004 and 2010, Eicher Motors sold 13 of its 15 businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. While many questioned its survival, a contrarian might have seen a more focused company, a leaner structure, growing demand for retro-styled motorcycles, and improving operational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Other Applications:** This includes early investments in growth companies when they are under-owned and underappreciated, spotting emerging trends (though risky, rewards can be substantial), and investing in great businesses experiencing temporary setbacks or negative news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:23]</a>.

### 5. Role of Contra Mutual Funds
For investors who prefer not to select individual stocks, mutual funds categorised as "Contra" funds can be an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:30]</a>. While often grouped with [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value funds]], Contra funds have shown to outperform most index funds and can challenge flexi-cap and multi-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:46]</a>. However, it's worth noting that many of these funds hold a significant portion (over 70%) of their assets in large-cap companies like HDFC Bank, Infosys, Reliance, and ICICI Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:10:02]</a>, and may have a large number of constituents (59 or more stocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:14]</a>, leading to questions about their true "contrarian" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:22]</a>. For more information, external reports like the one by Wisdom provide detailed analysis on [[role_of_contra_mutual_funds_in_investing | Contra mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:11:02]</a>.

### 6. High Dividend Yield Stocks (Dogs of the Dow)
This strategy involves investing in stocks with a high dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:09]</a>. The "Dogs of the Dow" strategy, for example, focuses on the 10 highest-yielding dividend stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:18]</a>.

*   **Rationale:** These stocks might be temporarily undervalued, offering attractive returns through dividend income and price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Characteristics:** This often leads to investments in utilities or distressed companies with low P/E and price-to-book ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:54]</a>. However, many such companies struggle with revenue growth and may have delivered negative stock returns over a five-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:12:04]</a>.

### 7. Investing in Maximum Pessimism
A core contrarian principle is to identify and invest during periods of maximum pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:37]</a>.

*   **Example: Peru in the 1980s** Sir John Templeton invested significantly in Peru in 1985 during its "lost decade" of economic stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:27]</a>. He reasoned that the country was at its point of maximum pessimism, implying significant upside potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:40]</a>. Over the next 10 years, the Peruvian economy recovered, and its stock market index rose by 140 times, yielding an 83% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Modern Examples:** Similar opportunities arose during the COVID-19 pandemic, where airline and hotel stocks faced significant declines due to travel restrictions but rebounded strongly as restrictions eased and demand picked up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:13:06]</a>.

### 8. Using Metrics and Screeners
Contrarians use metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, PEG ratio, price-to-book value, and EV/EBITDA to differentiate between expensive and relatively cheaper stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:36]</a>.

*   **Cheap vs. Undervalued:** It's a misconception that contrarians only invest in stocks with a low P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:41]</a>.
    *   **Cheap company:** May have favorable metrics (low P/E, high dividend yield, low price-to-book) but might remain cheap indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   **Undervalued opportunity:** Presents itself as a great business experiencing temporary headwinds (e.g., Infosys in 2016 or Maruti Suzuki in 2018), which can recover and provide substantial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:21]</a>. Investing in temporary setbacks of great businesses is generally a superior strategy to investing in permanently cheap businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Conclusion
To outperform the market or an index like the Nifty 50, one must adopt a contrarian approach in some capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:36]</a>. This requires a combination of patience, discipline, conviction, and superior research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:44]</a>. The benefits of a [[contrarian_investing_strategy | contradicting strategy]] include higher portfolio returns, reduced volatility, less overreaction to market developments, and better diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:15:06]</a>.

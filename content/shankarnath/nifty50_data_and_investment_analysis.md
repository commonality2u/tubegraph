This article explores the effectiveness of combining Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) with lumpsum investments, using historical [[Nifty Total Market Index | Nifty50]] data for [[Performance analysis in Indian stock market | performance analysis]].

## SIP vs. Lumpsum Investments: A Combined Approach

While often presented as an "either/or" choice, both SIPs and lumpsum investments are considered important for wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

*   **Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)**:
    *   A tried, tested, and highly effective system for continuous investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
    *   Smoothens the cost of acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
    *   Eliminates the need to time the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
    *   Provides stability to wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Lumpsum Investment**:
    *   More tactical in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   Aims to capitalize on market fluctuations, short-term declines, sudden movements in risk-reward equations, and market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   Acts like an "energy booster" for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

The combination of SIP and lumpsum is considered a "powerful combination for wealth building" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Despite the theoretical support, there is a noted lack of data-backed literature comparing or supporting an SIP plus lumpsum strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Some parts of the analysis may be confusing due to the difficulty of explaining complex spreadsheet scenarios verbally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It is recommended to access the underlying worksheet for a better understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Investment Analysis Using Nifty50 Data

The analysis utilizes [[Nifty Total Market Index | Nifty50]] data from Niftyindexes.com, covering January 2007 to December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Base SIP Scenario

A simple monthly SIP of 10,000 rupees over 17 years (January 2007 to December 2023) resulted in:
*   Total investment: A little over 20 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Corpus built: 61.4 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   CAGR (excluding dividends): 11.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This 11.8% serves as the base scenario for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Lumpsum Strategy 1: 5% Monthly Correction

This strategy involves an additional lumpsum investment whenever the [[Nifty Total Market Index | Nifty50]] index drops by 5% or more over the next month's closing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

*   **Assumptions**:
    *   Only [[Nifty Total Market Index | Nifty50]] closing values are considered, ignoring intraday volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   A correction is defined as a 5% drop from the previous month's closing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Example**: From November 2022 to February 2023, the [[Nifty Total Market Index | Nifty]] saw cumulative drops (e.g., 3.5% in December 2022, 2.5% in January 2023, etc.), but no single monthly drop breached the 5% threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Observations**:
    *   In 17 years, there were only 20 instances where the index dropped by 5% or more over a single month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   Six of these instances occurred in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   The last such opportunity was in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   This strategy is not very practical due to long waiting periods (sometimes 1-3 years) between opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

#### Simulation Results (5% Monthly Dip)

*   An additional lumpsum of 50,000 rupees was invested on each of the 20 occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   Total lumpsum invested: 10 lakh rupees (50,000 * 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Total amount invested (SIP + Lumpsum): 30.04 lakh rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Corpus swelled to over 1 crore rupees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Annualized Return (XIRR)**: Surprisingly, it remained at 11.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, the same as the base SIP scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This unexpected result is attributed to the low weight of earlier values in the discounting function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Lumpsum Strategy 2: 15% Dip from All-Time High

This strategy involved a lumpsum investment when the [[Nifty Total Market Index | Nifty]] dropped by 15% from its all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

*   **Observations**: Over the last 10 years, this strategy yielded only six investing opportunities (a couple in 2016 and four in 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This higher percentage dip also did not work effectively due to infrequent triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Lumpsum Strategy 3: 2% Monthly Correction

To find more opportunities, a smaller threshold was tested: a 2% monthly correction in the [[Nifty Total Market Index | Nifty50]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

*   **Observations**: This yielded significantly more investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. For example, 12 opportunities were found in the last three years alone (2021-2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

#### Simulation Results (2% Monthly Dip)

*   An additional 50,000 rupees was invested as a lumpsum during these 12 months (2021-2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Result**: The annualized return jumped from 14.9% (regular SIP) to 16.4% (SIP + Lumpsum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Incremental Return**: This represents an incremental 1.5% in returns, which is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: The same 1.5% differential was observed when applying the logic to a flat market period (January 2018 - December 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, suggesting the SIP plus lumpsum strategy has more potential compared to an SIP-only approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Limitations and Refinements of Lumpsum Strategy

A key limitation of the simulations is the assumption of an "unlimited supply of lumpsum money," which is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

*   **Scenario with Limited Lumpsum**:
    *   Assumption: Only 1 lakh rupees of lumpsum money available each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
    *   Condition: Invest 50,000 rupees in each half of the year on the first available lumpsum opportunity (2% dip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. If no opportunity arises, the amount remains unutilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Results**: Over a three-year period (2021-2023), it was possible to deploy the 50,000 rupee lumpsum in each of the six half-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, resulting in an annualized return of 15.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Over the entire 17-year period, this strategy improved the investment-to-wealth ratio, though it wasn't fully reflected in the XIRR number in the Excel sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> Defining a lumpsum strategy is complex and can be done in hundreds of ways (e.g., carry-forwarding amounts, different dip percentages like 3%, 4%, or 6%, varying frequencies like weekly or daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This complexity is likely why there's limited data-backed literature on SIP plus lumpsum strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Suggested Implementation for SIP + Lumpsum Strategy

To implement a combined SIP and lumpsum approach:

1.  **Set up SIPs**: Preferably on the first day or first week of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
2.  **Divide Lumpsum Money**: Split your available lumpsum into two or more chunks (e.g., 50,000 rupees for each half of the year from a 1 lakh rupee annual allocation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
3.  **Set Up Lumpsum Deployment Conditions**: Define a clear condition for deploying the lumpsum (e.g., a 2% or 5% dip, or based on moving averages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
4.  **Set Up Alerts**: Utilize screening portals and brokerage platforms to set up alerts for these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
5.  **Implement**: Act on the SIP + Lumpsum method on the respective trigger dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Performing a personal simulation on a worksheet is highly recommended for a deeper understanding and to customize the approach to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Readers who understand why the XIRR numbers did not significantly change in the earlier simulations, or who have a better way to deploy an SIP plus lumpsum strategy, are encouraged to share their insights, data assumptions, and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

The [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | Growth at Reasonable Price (GARP)]] approach to investing is a personal favorite screen for some investors, including Ish Mohit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article explores what GARP is, its foundational principles, and various screening methods that have shown significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## What is GARP?

GARP is an acronym for Growth At Reasonable Price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. As an [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investing style]], it bridges the gap between value investing and growth investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

*   **Value Investing** revolves around finding companies trading below their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, assessing a stock's worth *today* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Growth Investing** focuses on companies that can deliver above-average growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, aiming to assess a stock's worth 5 to 10 years from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

GARP investing combines both mindsets to offer a balanced [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The focus is not on finding cheap companies, but rather on identifying companies where growth is being underpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Origins and Key Metrics

The GARP [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | strategy]] was popularized by investor Peter Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. One of the most important [[key_metrics_in_garp_investing | tools]] in GARP investing, derived from Lynch's book "One Up On Wall Street," is the Price/Earnings To Growth (PEG) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Foundational Principles of GARP

A large part of the GARP [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investing framework]] revolves around growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Measuring Growth

Growth can be viewed in two ways:

1.  **Historic Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth:** Investing in companies that have grown their EPS at an accelerated pace historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. However, this strategy has not historically performed as well as expected because a company's growth rate changes over time, making EPS growth an unpredictable factor prone to manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:04:17]</a>.
2.  **Revenue Growth:** It's generally better to prioritize revenue growth, as it tends to be more sustainable and correlated over time compared to EPS growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:39]</a>.

### The PEG Ratio

The PEG ratio is integral to the GARP style of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:45]</a>.

*   **Calculation:** It's derived by taking a company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and dividing it by its EPS growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Utility:**
    *   **In Isolation:** A PEG ratio lower than one suggests the business is undervalued based on its earnings forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:51]</a>. Peter Lynch defined a PEG ratio of one as indicative of a fairly valued business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:23]</a>. Modern GARP investors may even consider a stock attractive if its PEG ratio is two or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:49]</a>.
    *   **Relative Basis:** Comparing one stock's PEG ratio to another simplifies comparisons between companies with different P/E ratios and growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Considerations:** When examining the PEG ratio, account for cyclicity in the P/E ratio and rely on future growth rather than historical growth rates for EPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Additional Parameters for GARP [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | Strategy]]

Beyond growth rate and PEG ratio, it's recommended to fortify a GARP [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | strategy]] with additional parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:57]</a>:

*   **Debt Ratio:** Total liabilities divided by total assets should not exceed 25% (as per Peter Lynch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Economic Moats:** The business should possess one or more powerful economic moats to ensure sustainability and protect profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Promoter Shareholding:** Should be high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Circle of Competence:** Be clear on which businesses to explore and which to avoid based on personal preferences and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Different GARP Investing Strategies

Since there is no single, defined GARP [[investing_patterns_and_strategies | investing strategy]], exploring [[different_approaches_to_garp_strategy | different variations]] is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:41]</a>.

### 1. `a_invest.com` Inspired Screener

This simple screener uses three variables: market capitalization, PEG ratio, and EPS growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:57]</a>.

*   **Criteria (Indian context adaptation):**
    *   PEG ratio: 0 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:05]</a>
    *   EPS Growth Rate: 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:07]</a>
    *   Market Capitalization: up to 10,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:10]</a>
*   **Results (Academic Exercise):** A list of 83 stocks, when populated as a portfolio using historical data, showed no negative returns in the last year and delivered a one-year return of 113% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:09:04]</a>.

### 2. Ish Mohit's GARP Framework

This framework, focused on large businesses (market cap > 50,000 crores), includes:

*   **Criteria:**
    *   Year-on-year quarterly sales growth: 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:27]</a>
    *   Year-on-year quarterly profit growth: 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:30]</a>
    *   P/E multiple: less than 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:32]</a>
*   **Results:** A query across companies with over 10,000 crores market cap yielded 47 stocks, with 62% having a PEG ratio between 0 and 1, and another 21% between 1 and 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:11:12]</a>. This framework managed a 110% return over the last one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:28]</a>.

### 3. Economic Times Methodology

This methodology uses a six-point criteria for GARP stock selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:39]</a>:

*   **Criteria:**
    *   Market cap: over 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:42]</a>
    *   Sales revenue: over 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:45]</a>
    *   5-year profit growth: at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:52]</a>
    *   Expected future profit growth: 15% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:57]</a>
    *   PEG ratio: less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>
    *   Minimum of five analysts covering the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:05]</a>
*   **Results:** This query yielded 131 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:34]</a>. A small portfolio of 10 stocks identified by this framework delivered an annual return of 51% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:50]</a>.

### 4. S&P 500 GARP Index

This index tracks companies adhering to S&P's definition of a GARP stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:13:06]</a>. It uses five factors:

*   **Growth Variables:**
    *   Three-year EPS growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:24]</a>
    *   Three-year Sales Per Share (SPS) growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:26]</a>
*   **Quality and Value Composite Factors:**
    *   Financial Leverage Ratio (total debt / book value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:39]</a>
    *   Return on Equity (12-month trailing EPS / book value per share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:48]</a>
    *   Earnings to Price Ratio (12-month trailing EPS / stock's current market price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:54]</a>

This index highlights how different [[key_metrics_in_garp_investing | metrics]] and variables can form a GARP [[asset_allocation_strategy | strategy]] and the importance of finding a proper balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:12]</a>.

## Designing a Custom GARP Investing Framework

A personalized GARP [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investing framework]] can be designed with the following criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:30]</a>:

*   **Market Cap:** Nothing below 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:33]</a>
*   **Minimum Sales:** At least 1,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:38]</a>
*   **PEG Ratio:** Between 0 and 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:44]</a>
*   **Sales CAGR:** 1, 3, and 5-year sales CAGR of at least 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:52]</a>
*   **EPS CAGR:** 1, 3, and 5-year CAGR of 15% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:59]</a>
*   **Expected Profits:** Next quarter's earnings higher than last year's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:15:06]</a>

This custom query resulted in a list of 27 companies with high sales and profit growth, diverse sectors, average promoter holding of about 55%, and comfortably high interest coverage ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:43]</a>. This custom GARP portfolio would have delivered 115% in returns over the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:16:05]</a>.

### Key Takeaway

The objective of GARP is not to find cheap companies, but to identify companies whose growth has been underpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:33]</a>. Always maintain a long-term perspective when employing a GARP [[asset_allocation_strategy | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:37]</a>.

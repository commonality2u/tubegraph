The [[relative_strength_index_introduction_and_history | Relative Strength Index (RSI)]] is a momentum oscillator introduced in 1978 by American mechanical engineer J. Welles Wilder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. It measures the velocity and magnitude of price movements, providing a signal to investors about when a stock is [[using_rsi_to_identify_overbought_and_oversold_stocks | overbought or oversold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The key phrase "relative strength" means that the indicator assesses a stock's strength or weakness based on its own performance, without comparing it to other stocks or the overall market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## How RSI is Calculated

The RSI is calculated based on upward or downward changes in prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. It is considered a lagging indicator, as it uses historical data, typically from the past 14 days, to generate potential buy or sell signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. The standard formula for RSI is:

RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>

Where RS is the average gain divided by the average loss over a specific period (e.g., 14 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Example: Calculating 14-Day RSI for HDFC Bank

To illustrate the calculation, consider the 14-day RSI for HDFC Bank Limited using recent October data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>:

*   **Step 1: Map Closing Prices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>
    *   Record the closing stock price for HDFC Bank for the past 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Step 2: Calculate Percentage Change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>
    *   Determine the percentage change in price for each of the 14 days. This change can be either upward or downward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Step 3: Isolate Gains and Losses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>
    *   Separate the days where the stock made a gain from the days where it incurred a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   **Step 4: Sum and Average** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>
    *   Sum up the percentage movements for all gain days and all loss days separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
    *   Divide these sums by the 14-day period to get the 14-day average gain and 14-day average loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
    *   For HDFC Bank, this resulted in a 14-day average gain of 0.31 and a 14-day average loss of 0.55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   **Step 5: Apply to RSI Formula** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>
    *   Insert the calculated average gain and average loss into the RSI formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
    *   For HDFC Bank as of October 31st, the 14-day RSI was 36.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

An RSI of 36.5 indicates that the stock is approaching the oversold zone, potentially signaling a buying opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

## RSI Range and Interpretation

The RSI always oscillates between 0 and 100 and can never be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

*   **RSI of 0**: Means the stock price has fallen for all 14 days of the calculation period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **RSI of 100**: Signifies 14 continuous days of upward price movement, indicating an overbought situation and a potential price correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

While RSI values of 0 and 100 are rare, the most common thresholds used are 30 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. An RSI above 70 is generally considered [[using_rsi_to_identify_overbought_and_oversold_stocks | overbought]] (a potential selling signal), and an RSI below 30 is considered [[using_rsi_to_identify_overbought_and_oversold_stocks | oversold]] (a potential buying signal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. However, experienced traders often adjust these thresholds to suit their investment style, and the 14-day window can also be tweaked, with 9-day and 25-day RSI gaining popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

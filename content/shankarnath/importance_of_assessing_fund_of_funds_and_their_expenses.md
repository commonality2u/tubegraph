Investing in "fund of funds" (FoF) is a mistake, often an accidental one, that many investors make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. It is crucial for investors to understand the structure and potential drawbacks of FoFs, particularly regarding their expenses.

## What is a Fund of Funds (FoF)?

A fund of funds is essentially a basket of other funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Rather than investing directly in individual stocks or bonds, an FoF invests in other mutual fund schemes.

## Why Exercise Caution with FoFs?

There are significant reasons to be cautious when considering investing in fund of funds:

### Potential for Unwanted Holdings and Complex Allocation
When investing in an FoF, you might end up with holdings in the basket that you don't want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. For instance:
*   The ICICI Prudential Asset Allocator Fund of Fund utilizes as many as 20 different schemes of its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   The Quantum Equity FoF Fund distributes its assets across nine different schemes belonging to other Asset Management Companies (AMCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Having so many schemes within a single fund can complicate an investor's overall portfolio asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### [[the_impact_of_investment_fees_and_expense_ratios | Double Expense Ratios]]
A primary reason to avoid fund of funds is the extra charge that investors must pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. FoFs involve a "double summation" of [[the_impact_of_investment_fees_and_expense_ratios | expense ratios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

For example:
*   The Quantum Equity FoF Fund has an [[the_impact_of_investment_fees_and_expense_ratios | expense ratio]] of 0.51% for its direct plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   This charge is *over and above* the [[the_impact_of_investment_fees_and_expense_ratios | expense ratios]] of the nine underlying schemes that constitute the FoF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Rough calculations suggest that the total [[the_impact_of_investment_fees_and_expense_ratios | expense ratio]] for such a fund (Quantum's fee plus the other AMC charges) could come to approximately 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Many investors are unaware of this double charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Therefore, when considering fund of funds schemes, it is essential to make the combined expense an important area of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

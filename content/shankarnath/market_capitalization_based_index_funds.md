Market capitalization based index funds are structured based on specific ranges of market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:49">[02:31:49]</a>.

## Examples in India
In India, various indices categorize companies by market capitalization:
*   **Nifty 50 Index**: Generally includes companies with a market cap exceeding 1 lakh crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>.
*   **Nifty Midcap 150**: Consists of companies with market caps ranging from 16,000 to 45,000 crores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

There are also many subsets within each market cap range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>:
*   **Large Cap**: Nifty 50, Nifty Next 50, Nifty 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:04">[02:56:04]</a>.
*   **Mid Cap**: Nifty Midcap 150, Nifty Midcap 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Small Cap**: The popular [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | Small Cap]] 250 with a few [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | Small Cap]] 50 funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:42">[03:08:42]</a>.

Hybrid combinations also exist, such as:
*   Nifty Mid [[how_to_invest_in_small_cap_index_funds | Small Cap]] 400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.
*   Nifty 500 [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | Multi-Cap]] 50-25-25 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
*   Nifty Large Mid Cap 250 index: Comprises 100 large-cap and 150 mid-cap companies, with each capitalization set having a 50% weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. An index fund mimicking the Large Mid Cap 250 index is operated by Edelweiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

## Free Float Market Capitalization
These market cap indices are not strictly based on the total market capitalization of constituent companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Instead, companies within these indices are picked based on their free float market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

> **Free Float Definition**
> Free float refers to shares readily available for trading in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. It excludes holdings by company promoters, the government, strategic investors, or shares that are locked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

For example, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) ranks 11th by total market cap but is 146th on a free float market cap basis, keeping it outside the Nifty 50 list because over 96% of its outstanding shares are held by the Government of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Issue with Skewed Weightage
A common issue with market cap based indices is that a few companies can carry a much larger weight, potentially skewing the index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. For instance, within the Nifty 50, the top five companies (Reliance, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys, and HDFC) collectively hold about 50% weightage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

As index funds grow, this can lead to larger companies becoming overvalued at the expense of smaller companies within the same index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This contrasts with an equal weight index fund, which allocates the same weight to every constituent company, leading to more sectoral diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

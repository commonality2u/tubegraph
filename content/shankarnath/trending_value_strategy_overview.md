The [[trending_value_strategy | Trending Value Strategy]] is an investment approach that combines the principles of both [[market_trends_and_indicators_analysis | momentum]] and [[value_and_contrarian_investing | value investing]] to potentially outperform the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:58">[03:00:58]</a>. This strategy was first introduced by James O'Shaughnessy in his book, "What Works on Wall Street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:05">[02:03:05]</a>.

## Strategy Performance

A portfolio of 25 stocks based on the [[trending_value_strategy | Trending Value Strategy]] delivered an annualized gain of 96.9% over approximately 11 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This significantly outperformed:
*   The Nifty 50, which gained about 30% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   The Midcap 150 index, which saw a 52% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   Factor funds like [[momentum_and_value_index_strategy | Momentum and Alpha]], where the Nifty 50 delivered 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Sectoral indices, including the Nifty PSU index, which crossed the 90% mark but did not surpass 96.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Historically, the [[trending_value_strategy | Trending Value Strategy]] has consistently outperformed market indices over long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Between 1964 and 2009, it delivered annualized returns of 21.1%, compared to the S&P 500's 9.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   An initial investment of $10,000 in 1964 would have grown to over $69 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

A study by Capitalmind on Indian stocks from 2007 to 2023 showed the [[trending_value_strategy | Trending Value Strategy]] achieved a CAGR of 20.6%, while the Nifty 50 delivered 9.9% over the same 16-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

## Core Elements: Trending and Value

The [[trending_value_strategy | Trending Value Strategy]] combines two primary components:

### Trending (Momentum)
"Trending" refers to [[market_trends_and_indicators_analysis | momentum]], identifying stocks that are already showing an upward price movement and are catching the market's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:37">[02:15:37]</a>. This list can be extracted by sorting stocks by their six-month returns in descending order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>. While six-month momentum is commonly used, three or four-month cycles can also be considered for a more aggressive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:02">[11:34:02]</a>.

### Value
"Value" involves identifying fundamentally strong yet undervalued companies that the market has not yet fully recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:04">[02:45:04]</a>. O'Shaughnessy uses a "Value Composite 2" indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>, which combines six different metrics:
1.  **P/E ratio (Price to Earnings):** Current market price per share divided by earnings per share; lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
2.  **P/B ratio (Price to Book):** Useful for capital-intensive businesses; lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
3.  **Price to Cash Flow from Operations:** Low number indicates an attractive business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
4.  **Price to Sales:** O'Shaughnessy's favorite metric; lower is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
5.  **EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** Enterprise Value (market cap + net debt) divided by EBITDA; lower is preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
6.  **Dividend Yield:** Higher is more favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## Synergy of Momentum and Value Investing Strategies

Combining [[momentum_and_value_investing_strategies | momentum and value investing strategies]] yields superior results compared to either approach alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:58">[03:00:58]</a>. O'Shaughnessy's backtesting over 45 years revealed:
*   S&P index annual returns: ~11.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   Momentum-only strategy: ~14.5% yearly return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   Value-only strategy (using Value Composite 2): ~17.3% annualized return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   [[trending_value_strategy | Trending Value Strategy]] (combination of value and momentum): ~21.2% average yearly return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Constructing a Trending Value Stock Portfolio

[[constructing_a_trending_value_stock_portfolio | Constructing a trending value stock portfolio]] involves a systematic process:

1.  **Define the Universe:** Select companies based on a minimum market capitalization (e.g., at least 500 crores for Indian stocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Extract Value Metrics:** Gather data for the six [[valuation_indicators_and_selling_strategies | valuation indicators]] (P/E, P/B, Price to Cash Flow, Price to Sales, EV/EBITDA, Dividend Yield) for all companies in the defined universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
3.  **Calculate Value Composite Score:**
    *   Allocate a decile rank for each company across all six metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. For example, the lowest 10% of P/E ratios are assigned decile 1, the next 10% decile 2, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
    *   For negative or unavailable ratios, the 10th decile (10 points) is typically assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.
    *   A lower decile score indicates a more undervalued company on that parameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.
    *   Sum the decile scores across all six metrics to get a cumulative value score for each company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
4.  **Identify Momentum Stocks:** From the companies in the top decile (lowest value scores), extract their six-month stock price returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
5.  **Final Selection:** Sort this truncated list by six-month returns in descending order. The top 25 stocks comprise the [[trending_value_strategy | Trending Value Portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Management and Rebalancing

### Number of Stocks
While the number of stocks can vary, O'Shaughnessy's backtesting suggests a 25-stock portfolio generally yields the highest risk-adjusted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

### Rebalancing Frequency
[[portfolio_management_and_rebalancing_for_trending_value_strategy | Portfolio rebalancing]] should ideally be conducted on a semi-annual basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. For a more aggressive approach, quarterly rebalancing can also be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.

### Rebalancing Process
The rebalancing process involves repeating the original [[constructing_a_trending_value_stock_portfolio | portfolio construction]] steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>:
1.  Pull a new list of companies meeting market cap criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
2.  Extract the six value metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.
3.  Compute new combined value scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.
4.  Extract a subset of the top value deciles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.
5.  Combine with current [[market_trends_and_indicators_analysis | momentum]] metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.
6.  Finalize a new list of 25 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
7.  Sell underperformers from the older list (stocks that have fallen out of the top decile for value and momentum) and replace them with the new top-ranking stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.
8.  All holdings should be equally weighted in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

### Characteristics of Identified Companies
The [[trending_value_strategy | Trending Value Strategy]] often identifies companies with:
*   Lower [[valuation_indicators_and_selling_strategies | valuation metrics]] (low P/E, P/B, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.
*   A Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) typically over 18%, indicating efficient capital use to generate profits and reducing the risk of a "value trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>.
*   A higher exposure to small-cap and micro-cap companies, which can lead to higher portfolio volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.

The [[trending_value_strategy | Trending Value Strategy]] is a robust approach that has demonstrated strong outperformance across various markets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.

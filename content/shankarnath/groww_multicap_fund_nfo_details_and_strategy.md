Predicting which market index or sector will perform best in the coming year is challenging, as historical data shows varying toppers year by year, and the task of identifying winners becomes increasingly difficult as the economy grows and more companies are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | Multicap schemes]] are highlighted as a category that simplifies investment decisions by making it easier for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

This article details the GROWW [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | Multicap Fund]], currently undergoing an NFO (New Fund Offering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Understanding Multicap Funds

A [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | multicap fund]] is best understood by contrasting it with a [[comparison_of_multicap_and_flexicap_funds | flexicap fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **[[comparison_of_multicap_and_flexicap_funds | Flexicap Funds]]**: In these schemes, the fund manager has the flexibility to allocate any proportion or percentage of assets across large-cap, mid-cap, and [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small-cap]] buckets. For example, a fund manager could allocate 80% to large caps, 20% to mid-caps, and nothing to [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small caps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. While this provides flexibility, it meant there wasn't a single mutual fund category for a truly diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **[[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | Multicap Funds]]**: To address the need for true diversification across multiple market caps, [[sebi_regulations_on_multicap_funds | SEBI]] (Securities and Exchange Board of India) mandated the creation of a separate [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | multicap fund]] category in September 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Every [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | multicap scheme]] must invest at least 25% of its assets in each of the three market cap categories: large caps, mid-caps, and [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small caps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Benefits of the Multicap Structure
Despite seeming restrictive, the [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | multicap]] structure offers significant advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>:
*   **Managerial Flexibility**: Fund managers retain flexibility in overall asset allocation, allowing for combinations like 50:25:25, 40:30:30, or 33:33:33 across large, mid, and [[small_cap_investing_strategy | small caps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Diversified Stock Picking**: Fund managers can select specific stocks from all three market cap buckets, ensuring investments are in the most ideal companies within each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Market Navigation**: [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | Multicaps]] effectively navigate the dynamic nature of the Indian stock market, contributing to good performance and managing volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The speaker considers them the fulcrum of their own [[investment_and_portfolio_growth_strategies | wealth creation strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Benchmarking and Performance
[[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | Multicap funds]] are actively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Their primary benchmark is typically the Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25 index, which is more suitable than the Nifty 500 due to its alignment with the fund's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Historically, the multicap index has outperformed the Nifty 500 and Nifty 50 across various years on a trailing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. When examined on an SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) basis, there has consistently been a 1.5% to 2% alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Rolling returns analysis shows average and median returns consistently around 13%, which is about 1 to 1.5% higher than the Nifty 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Longer investment periods (7, 10, 15 years) show a strong probability of achieving returns in the 12% to 16% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This suggests [[multicap_funds_investment_strategy | multicaps]] offer a disciplined and stable approach to investing with good volatility management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

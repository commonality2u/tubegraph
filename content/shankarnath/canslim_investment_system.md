The [[CANSLIM investment system | CANSLIM investment system]] is an investment methodology developed by William J. O'Neil in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It is one of the most studied [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | investment strategies]] worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The system is detailed in O'Neil's book, *How to Make Money in Stocks*, published in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The book's foundation examines the characteristics of the best-performing stocks over 125 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

O'Neil, who began as a retail broker and was an early pioneer in charting on computers, combines fundamental analysis (picking strong companies) with technical analysis (timing entry and exit points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The [[CANSLIM investment system | CANSLIM]] acronym represents a seven-step process or set of rules to identify quality, high-growth stocks at an early stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## The Seven Pillars of CANSLIM

### C: Current Quarterly Earnings Per Share
This characteristic was highly prevalent among winning stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Investors should seek companies with sharply increased quarterly earnings year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. An increase of over 25% is considered good, especially if the growth is accelerating and supported by a similar increase in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### A: Annual Earnings
To confirm that recent quarterly growth is not a fluke, investors must also examine the company's annual EPS growth over the last three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The average annual EPS growth should be at least 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Some leeway can be given for cyclicity if volume supports the growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### N: New Products, Services, or New Management
William O'Neil emphasizes that significant advancement in a stock often requires something "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This can include:
*   Innovative products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   Creation of new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>
*   Significant changes in government policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
*   New technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
*   A new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
O'Neil's studies indicate that 95% of superstar stocks in the last century had some form of newness driving their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Identifying companies at the forefront of industry trends by examining their track record of new product releases, R&D efforts, and patent filings is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### S: Supply and Demand
This refers to the supply and demand of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. O'Neil suggests looking for stocks with fewer shares outstanding, as this indicates restricted supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Share buyback programs or top management with equity interests are also positive indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. From a technical perspective, the ideal buying point is a breakout from previous resistance levels, often seen through chart patterns like the "cup and handle," indicating higher demand from institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### L: Leaders or Laggards
The simple rule here is to buy market leaders, not laggards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Investors should look to invest in the number one, number two, or at most, the number three company within a strong and leading industry group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. These stocks typically have the highest relative strength, good market share, increasing EPS, and strong sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

**Relative Strength (RS)**
Relative strength refers to a stock's price performance compared to the broader market or its industry peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The [[CANSLIM investment system | CANSLIM]] method focuses on companies with a relative strength value of at least 80, meaning they have outperformed 80% of all other stocks within their industry or market group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This metric helps distinguish leaders from laggards and identify upward-trending stocks, combining both fundamental and technical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### I: Institutional Sponsorship
This refers to investments by large entities such as mutual funds, pension funds, high-net-worth individuals, and insurance companies, who account for a significant share of market activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. A recent increase in institutional shareholding is generally a positive factor and can be spotted by examining volume charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The time it takes these funds to build positions (weeks, often months) provides an opportunity for retail investors to enter the stock at an early stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### M: Market Direction
Even if all six preceding factors are correct, being wrong about market direction can lead to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. O'Neil's research indicates that three out of every four stocks follow the general market's direction or trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The simple rule is to buy stocks only when the broader market (e.g., Nifty 50) is trending up and avoid buying when it is trending down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

Key highlights regarding market direction:
*   **Bear vs. Bull Market Trends:** In a bear market, stocks typically open strong but close weak, while the opposite occurs in a bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Analyzing price movements, chart patterns, and volumes helps gauge market health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Volume Analysis:** Investors should look for increased volumes accompanying increased share prices, indicating strong buying interest and a potentially positive market direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Distribution Days:** A "distribution day" occurs when an index (e.g., Nifty 50) loses more than 0.2% of its value on a single day with higher volumes than the previous session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This usually signifies that large institutional investors are exiting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. While one or two distribution days are not problematic, successive distribution days indicate market weakening, prompting investors to reduce their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. A bull market typically ends after four or five distribution days over a span of four to five weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Chart Patterns: The Cup and Handle

William O'Neil's book heavily features charts, emphasizing the information available from stock price and volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Among his favorite patterns are the cup and handle, the double bottom, and the flat base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Cup and Handle Pattern
This pattern consists of a "cup" (a U-shaped price consolidation) and a "handle" (a smaller, shorter consolidation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
1.  **Prior Uptrend:** There should be a prior uptrend of at least 30% before the pattern begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
2.  **Depth of the Base:** Measured from the left-side peak to the lowest point of the cup, this depth typically ranges between 15% and 30%, though it can reach 50% in severe bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
3.  **Base Length:** The minimum length for the base is seven weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. A shorter base (e.g., five weeks) is insufficient for consolidation, increasing the chance of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
4.  **Handle:** This is a mild pullback, usually 10-12% deep, lasting approximately two to four weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. It represents a "shakeout" where weaker investors exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Volume during the handle formation should not be high; ideally, it should be low, indicating no serious sell-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The best scenario is a "nice, small, smooth low volume handle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
5.  **Ideal Buy Point:** This is normally just above the peak of the handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. O'Neil recommends buying as close to this point as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The buying range extends up to five percent above the ideal buy point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
6.  **Breakout Day:** This is the day the stock surpasses its ideal buy point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. On breakout day, the volume should be at least 40% to 50% higher than the normally traded volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This indicates strong institutional buying, with volume spikes of 100%, 200%, 500%, or even 1000% being common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Selling Rules

O'Neil asserts that the secret to winning big in the stock market is not always being right, but losing the least amount of money when wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. As a primary [[investment_philosophy_and_strategy | strategy]], he encourages investors to cut losses if a stock declines by 7% to 8% from the buying price, with no exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. The book outlines nine selling scenarios:

1.  **Distribution Days:** If the market index sees multiple days with a 0.2% drop and increasing volume, it signals caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
2.  **Stock Splits with Excessive Gain:** If a stock rises by 25% or more within two weeks of a stock split, it's considered an excessive gain and a signal to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
3.  **Technical Analysis Break:** If a stock cuts through its upper channel line after a significant run-up, it can usually be sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
4.  **New All-Time High with Dried-Up Volume:** When a stock reaches new all-time highs but volume has significantly decreased, it indicates a selling opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
5.  **Poor Relative Strength:** A stock exhibiting poor relative strength is a sign of weakness and a potential sell signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
6.  **"Loan Ranger" Stock:** If a stock continues to advance while the rest of its industry group is stagnant or declining, it might indicate industry-wide issues or that the company has eliminated competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
7.  **Closing at Day's Lowest Price:** If a stock consistently closes at its day's lowest price for several consecutive days, it warrants attention and caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
8.  **Slowdown in Earnings Growth:** A fundamental reason to sell is a decrease in earnings growth (not necessarily negative earnings) for two or more consecutive quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
9.  **12-15% Fall from Peak:** A general rule is to sell or review a stock position if it falls by 12% to 15% from its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

The guiding principle for selling is that it is as crucial to sell stocks at the opportune time as it is to buy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

This article explores the complex dynamics of international relations and alliance formations during the Cold War, focusing on the interactions between Russia (the Soviet Union), the United States, and China, and their impact on India and Pakistan. [[indiapakistan_geopolitical_dynamics | India and Pakistan geopolitical dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> It examines the consequences of intervening in other nations' problems and the critical importance of understanding geopolitical alignments before taking action. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> The narrative also touches upon a series of "limited wars"—conflicts fought for objectives less than regime change [[geopolitical_strategies_and_historical_conflicts | Geopolitical strategies and historical conflicts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>—and their short-term expected and long-term unexpected consequences. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

The podcast speaker outlines a "game plan" involving:
1. Pivotal decisions made by different players. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
2. The "playing field" delimited by these decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
3. The "teams" or alliances, noting some were prime allies while others were subprime, and how these mixed and matched over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
4. The "game" or interaction between these players. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
5. The "plays" or techniques used in this geopolitical game. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>

## Pivotal Decisions and Situations Shaping the Playing Field

Several key decisions and evolving situations fundamentally altered the geopolitical landscape for India, Pakistan, and the major powers.

### China's Conquest of Tibet
After winning the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Mao Zedong spent the next two years consolidating power, which included conquering Xinjiang and Tibet [[mao_zedong_as_a_military_and_political_leader | Mao Zedong as a military and political leader]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> Tibet, autonomous since 1911, held significant mineral resources. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> Mao's decision to reconquer Tibet in 1950 led to a permanent Chinese military presence, facilitated by the construction of extensive road systems between 1950 and 1957. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
The western road route through Tibet was particularly crucial, providing year-round traffic and enabling control over Tibet, as well as a pincer onto Xinjiang. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a> This road passed through the Aksai Chin Plateau, an area disputed between China and India. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
The conquest of Tibet and road construction eliminated the large buffer zone that had previously existed between China and India, reducing it to the small Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> This directly led to territorial disputes: China took the Aksai Chin Plateau (claimed by India), while India held Arunachal Pradesh (claimed by China). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

### US "Pactomania" and Alliance with Pakistan
Under President Eisenhower, the United States pursued a strategy dubbed "pactomania," forming bilateral relations and regional groupings to counter the Soviet Union [[cold_war_history_and_its_modern_implications | Cold War history and its modern implications]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> A key element was the "Northern Tier strategy," exemplified by the Baghdad Pact (Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan), aimed at walling off the Soviet Union from Middle Eastern oil fields [[impact_of_oil_on_historical_and_modern_geopolitics | Impact of oil on historical and modern geopolitics]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
As a sweetener for Pakistan to join, the US allied with Pakistan and provided a significant military aid treaty. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> This horrified Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who stated it changed the balance of power and that Pakistan would likely use US arms against India. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> Eisenhower later reportedly admitted this decision was "perhaps the worst kind of plan and decision we could ever have made." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> The pact poisoned US-India relations for the duration of the Cold War, as arming either India or Pakistan typically led to that aid being aimed at the other. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>

### The Devolving Sino-Soviet Relationship
Until China acquired atomic weapons in 1964, Mao had to maintain a degree of deference to Russia for technological and nuclear aid, especially after being cut off from the West post-Korean War. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> After detonating an atomic weapon, Mao began to assert Chinese grievances, claiming the Soviet Union occupied too many places and that Russia had taken vast territories from the Chinese sphere of influence under the Czars [[sinoindian_and_sinosoviet_relations | Sino-Indian and Sino-Soviet relations]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>

**Mao's Gripes Against Russia:**
* Stalin setting up China to fight Japan in WWII to avoid a two-front war for the USSR. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
* Stalin taking Mongolia from the Chinese sphere of influence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
* Stalin's willingness to "fight to the last Chinese" in the Korean War. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
* Russian advice for Mao to halt at the Yangtze during the Chinese Civil War, desiring a divided China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>
* Khrushchev's rejection of Mao's bid to be senior statesman of communism after Stalin's death. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
* Khrushchev's de-Stalinization, which Mao opposed due to his own cult of personality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
* Khrushchev's pursuit of peaceful coexistence with the West, contrasting with Mao's Cultural Revolution [[the_great_leap_forward_and_the_cultural_revolution | The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>
These tensions became public with the Sino-Soviet split propaganda in 1960. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>

**Russia's Gripes Against China:**
* China's refusal to grant Russia bases, unlike Western powers' allies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> Russia had to return former Czarist treaty ports after the Korean War due to Chinese troop presence in Manchuria and the post-Stalin succession struggle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>
* Mao's Taiwan Strait crises in 1954 and 1958, undertaken without consulting Russia, despite a friendship treaty that could obligate Russian involvement. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>
* China's rejection of a combined Sino-Soviet naval base, leading Russia to withhold atomic weapon plans [[the_making_and_impact_of_the_atomic_bomb | The making and impact of the atomic bomb]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>
* Tensions over the Vietnam War: China and Russia both aided North Vietnam to prove revolutionary credentials. Russia needed to transport aid via train through China, leading to Chinese harassment and claims that the aid originated from China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>

This escalating animosity culminated in the **Sino-Soviet Border Conflict of 1969** over river islands like Damansky/Zhenbao on the Amur River. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> During this conflict, Russia reportedly asked the US if it was acceptable to "nuke these people" (the Chinese), to which the US replied "no." [[cold_war_nuclear_weapon_developments_and_global_politics | Cold War nuclear weapon developments and global politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a> Mao identified the one wanting to use nuclear weapons as the primary adversary. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a> This event marked a critical shift: prior to this, the US was the primary adversary for both Russia and China; afterward, Russia and China became primary adversaries of each other, causing a reshuffling of global alliances. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>

## Alliances and Alignments: The "Teams"

The podcast uses the term "alliance" loosely to refer to signatories of mutual defense pacts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>

### India's Shifting Alignments
* **Initial Non-Alignment and Soviet Leanings:** While Stalin viewed Nehru as a "lackey of British colonialism," Khrushchev saw India as important for counterbalancing China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> Nehru, while aiming for friendly terms with both Russia and America, felt more in common with Russia due to his Fabian socialist economic policies, and was appalled by US segregation and its coziness with colonial powers. [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | Historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>
* **Generosity Towards China:** Despite non-alignment, India initially treated China generously:
  * Immediate recognition of the PRC in 1950. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>
  * Refusal to sign the 1951 San Francisco Treaty (ending the war with Japan) because China and Russia weren't present. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>
  * Signing a friendship treaty with China to help break its diplomatic isolation, recognizing Chinese sovereignty over Tibet—a permanent move under international law. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>
  * Voting from 1960 onwards to seat the PRC (not Taiwan) in the UN. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>
* **Deterioration with China:** While India was making these gestures, China was building roads in Tibet (completed by 1957, discovered by India in 1958). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> Chinese repression of Tibetan culture, which has Indian origins, appalled Indians. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a> The Dalai Lama's flight to India in 1959 further angered China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a> China offered a sovereignty swap: Aksai Chin for Arunachal Pradesh, which Nehru rejected. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>

### The Sino-Indian War (1962) and its Aftermath
During the Cuban Missile Crisis (when Russia was preoccupied), China launched the Sino-Indian War and took the Aksai Chin Plateau. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a> India's defeat was total due to a lack of roads for deployment compared to China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>
Nehru expressed deep betrayal, stating China returned "evil for good." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a> The war transformed India:
* Its leadership became angry "forever." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>
* India doubled its army size within 10 years (to 750,000) and created 10 mountain divisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>
The speaker posits that a Sino-Indian team-up could have created a very different world order. [[the_role_of_historical_alliances_and_consequences_of_failure | The Role of Historical Alliances and Consequences of Failure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>

### Realignment Post-1962
* **India:** Looked to Russia to counterbalance China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>
* **Pakistan:** Saw China as a potential ally, no longer fearing a Sino-Indian team-up. Bhutto played the "China card" for nuclear assistance. [[the_impact_of_mao_zedongs_policies_on_chinese_society | The impact of Mao Zedong's policies on Chinese society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a> In 1963, Pakistan ceded territory to China, possibly in exchange for nuclear development help. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>

### Dynamics of "Shared Problems"
* **Pakistan-China:** Shared India as their problem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>
* **India-Russia:** Shared China as their problem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>
These shared adversarial relationships fostered cooperation.

### The United States' Difficult Position
The US struggled in South Asia because it wanted to befriend both India and Pakistan. Befriending one appalled the other, leading the US to "appall everybody." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>
* **US Goal:** For India and Pakistan to set aside differences and combine against China to stop communism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>
* **India/Pakistan Goal:** Use the US for maximum aid against the other. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>
* **Pakistan's Additional Goal:** For the US to be "nice with China," as Pakistan wanted good relations with both, a non-starter for the US until secret visits in 1971. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>

### Understanding Alliances Through Primary Adversaries
The speaker suggests that understanding who is the primary adversary of whom is key to understanding alliances. [[allied_versus_axis_strategies_during_world_war_ii | Allied versus Axis strategies during World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>
* **WWII Allies (UK, US, USSR):** Had mutually exclusive ultimate goals (British Empire, US decolonization, Soviet communism) but shared a common existential threat in Hitler, acting as a "superglue." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>
* **WWII Axis (Italy, Japan, Germany):** Had non-mutually exclusive goals (spheres of influence) but different primary enemies (Britain for Italy; Russia for Germany; China then US for Japan). They fought parallel wars and did not align effectively. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>
The principle: Unlikely partners will cooperate if they share a primary enemy perceived as an existential threat. Likely cooperators (e.g., ideologically similar states) may not cooperate if they don't share a primary enemy and theater of interest. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>

The US had "lousy cards" in South Asia because it didn't share primary enemies with India or Pakistan. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a> India and Russia shared a China problem; Pakistan and China shared an India problem, giving them cards to play. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>

## Key Conflicts and Their Impact on Alliances

### Indo-Pakistani War of 1965
Following India's 1962 defeat and Nehru's death in 1964, Pakistan saw 1965 as an opportune time to settle border issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a> After an initial probe in the Rann of Kutch, Pakistan focused on Kashmir. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a> India responded by invading towards Lahore. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> The US imposed a double arms embargo, which hurt Pakistan more due to its greater dependence on US military aid. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>
Neither the US nor Russia wanted this war. The US was happy for the Soviets to broker the Tashkent Declaration ending the war. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a> Pakistan was worse off, while India restored its military reputation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>
The US had previously guaranteed its arms wouldn't be used by India and Pakistan against each other but could not enforce this; Pakistani forces used US tanks in the largest tank battle since WWII. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>

### Bangladesh War of Independence (1971)
Pakistan held presidential elections where Bengalis from East Pakistan won. The Punjabi-dominated military in West Pakistan responded by sending the army to East Pakistan, leading to massacres and a refugee crisis in India. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>
The US remained silent on this humanitarian crisis. [[impact_of_plagues_on_human_history | Impact of plagues on human history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a> This coincided with Nixon's efforts to get invited to Beijing to discuss cooperation with China against the Soviet Union, a crucial step in winning the Cold War. [[china_and_the_uss_race_in_ai_and_superintelligence | China and the US's race in AI and superintelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a> Pakistan was the intermediary for this communication. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>
India requested US intervention to prevent Chinese involvement and to raise human rights issues at the UN, but the US refused and even blamed India for the war. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a> Furious, Indira Gandhi signed a military pact with Russia and upgraded relations with Vietnam. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a> India also restricted US scholars' visas, impacting Indian studies programs in the US. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>
For India, Pakistan's decision to overturn its elections by deploying the army to East Pakistan provided an "opportunity the like of which will never come again" (quoting Indian defense analyst Subrahmanyam). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a> India armed insurgents in East Pakistan and then sent in its conventional army, leading to the creation of Bangladesh. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a> This war led both India (to protect against China) and Pakistan (to deal with Indian superiority) to pursue nuclear weapons more actively. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>

### Kargil War (1999)
Pakistan again attempted to alter the Line of Control in Kashmir. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a> Facing international pressure, including from China (which was not interested in a nuclear war over this), and a US demand to admit crossing the line and withdraw, Pakistani leader Nawaz Sharif signed the Washington Agreement to pull back. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a> This was a humiliation for Pakistan. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>

## Superpower Strategies and Interactions

### The United States
* **Frustrating Relations with Pakistan:** US interest in Pakistan was intermittent, tied to specific needs due to the lack of a shared primary enemy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>
  * **Listening Posts:** Pre-satellite imagery, Pakistan's location near the Soviet Union was vital for U2 spy plane bases (e.g., Peshawar) and listening posts (e.g., Badaber). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a> After a U2 was shot down over the USSR in 1960, Khrushchev threatened Pakistan, leading to Pakistani anxiety. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a> Combined with the 1965 arms freeze, Pakistan felt betrayed and cancelled the Badaber lease in 1968. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a> Ayub Khan accused the US of betraying Pakistan at every turn. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>
  * **China Outreach:** Pakistan facilitated Nixon and Kissinger's communication with China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>
  * **Soviet-Afghan War:** After the Shah of Iran fell and Russia invaded Afghanistan in 1979, Pakistan became essential again. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a> The Reagan administration provided $3.2 billion in aid, funneled through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), making it incredibly powerful. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a> The ISI armed insurgents, including anti-Western groups, with follow-on effects like 9/11, and also diverted funds to Kashmir. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>
  * **Post-9/11:** The US again needed Pakistan for operations in Afghanistan, though relations soured after the Osama bin Laden raid. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>
  * **Ignoring Proliferation:** During periods of needing Pakistan, the US often overlooked human rights abuses and, critically, nuclear proliferation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a> Zbigniew Brzezinski advised Carter that security policy couldn't be dictated by non-proliferation policy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>
* **Difficult Relations with India:**
  * Indian leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, and Indira Gandhi were critical of US policies, particularly segregation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a> They viewed capitalism as a way station to imperialism and fascism, while Americans saw socialism as a way station to communism. [[the_evolution_and_implications_of_managerial_capitalism | The evolution and implications of managerial capitalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>
  * Indian officials often made insulting remarks to American VIPs, contrasting with Pakistan's welcoming stance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a> This created a negative trend: US support for India in 1962, neutrality in 1965, and support for Pakistan in 1971. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>

### Russia (Soviet Union)
* **Relationship with India:** Khrushchev cultivated India as a counterbalance to China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> Russia offered India military and economic aid, and crucial UN Security Council vetoes (e.g., against plebiscites in Kashmir, against halting India's offensive in the 1971 war). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a> For Russia, India was a useful counterbalance to China, leading to a "beautiful relationship." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>
* **Relationship with China:** (See Sino-Soviet Split section above). Tensions included territorial claims, ideological differences, and squabbling over aid to Vietnam. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> Russia wanted India to counterbalance China, not to decimate Pakistan with aid intended for defense against China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>

### China
* **Relationship with Pakistan:** Following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Pakistan began to see China as a key ally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a> China provided nuclear assistance and spare parts to Pakistan. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>
* **Relationship with India:** The 1962 war secured Aksai Chin for China but created a permanent enemy in India. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a> China also funded insurgencies in India (Mizos, Manipuris, Nagas, Naxalites) from after the 1962 war until 1979. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>
* **Relationship with Russia:** (See Sino-Soviet Split section above). The 1969 border conflict cemented their status as primary adversaries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>

## Instruments of National Power: The "Plays"

Nations employed a variety of tools to achieve their objectives in this complex geopolitical game [[grand_strategy_and_national_power_coordination | Grand Strategy and National Power Coordination]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>

* **Diplomacy and Negotiation:**
  * **Indus Waters Treaty (1960):** Brokered by the US, this treaty allocated river waters between India and Pakistan for irrigation, with the US contributing significantly to dam construction. It massively benefited both but earned the US no enduring gratitude. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>
  * **Tashkent Declaration (1965):** Brokered by the Soviets, ending the Indo-Pakistani War, welcomed by the US as both superpowers wanted the conflict to cease. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>
  * **Washington Agreement (1999):** The US (with China's backing) pressured Pakistan to withdraw from Kargil after admitting it crossed the Line of Control. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>
  * US diplomatic efforts to get India and Pakistan to settle differences generally failed due to false assumptions: that they could be cajoled, that the China threat would align India with the West (India aligned with Russia instead), and that Western aid would buy influence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>
* **Public Support and Denial:**
  * **Goa (1961):** The US supported Portugal (a NATO ally with important US bases) when India took back the Portuguese colony of Goa, angering India. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>
  * **Indian Silence on Soviet Actions:** Nehru's India remained silent on the 1956 Hungarian crisis and the 1961 Berlin crisis. Indira Gandhi's India was silent on the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>
* **UN Security Council Vetoes:** Russia used its veto power to support India by blocking plebiscites in Kashmir and attempts to halt India's offensive during the 1971 Bangladesh War. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>
* **Economic Aid:**
  * The US provided far more economic aid than Russia or China, yet Pakistan and India preferred China and Russia respectively. [[economic_and_strategic_implications_of_energy_resources | Economic and strategic implications of energy resources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>
  * **Bihar Famine (1967):** The US sent 20% of its wheat crop ($1.5 billion worth) to India. However, President Johnson, angry at India's perceived friendliness with North Vietnam, provided it "ship to mouth" (at the last minute), infuriating Indira Gandhi and earning no US gratitude. India subsequently focused on food self-sufficiency. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a> The Green Revolution, aided by Ford and Rockefeller foundations, also contributed, again with no credit to the US. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>
  * India and Pakistan skillfully solicited aid from multiple donors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>
* **Military Aid:** This proved even more difficult to calibrate than economic aid. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>
  * US military aid to Pakistan (part of "pactomania") introduced the Cold War to South Asia and drove India towards Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>
  * US aid to India after the 1962 Sino-Indian war alienated Pakistan, pushing it towards China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>
  * US aid to Pakistan's ISI to counter Soviets in Afghanistan was diverted to Kashmir, fueling insurgency there from 1989. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>
* **Carrier Battle Groups:** The US deployed the USS Enterprise (its first nuclear-propelled aircraft carrier) to the Bay of Bengal during the 1971 war. This had no effect on the war's outcome (Pakistan lost) but infuriated India. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>
* **Sanctions and Embargoes:** The US frequently used embargoes (e.g., during Partition, the 1965 war, and in response to nuclear progress). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a> Pakistan felt unfairly targeted, as India tested a nuclear device in 1974 while Pakistan did not test until much later. Sanctions ultimately failed to stop proliferation, evidenced by tit-for-tat tests in 1998. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>
* **Territorial Trade-offs:** Pakistan ceded territory to China in 1963, speculated to be in exchange for nuclear assistance [[grand_strategy_and_national_power_coordination | Grand Strategy and National Power Coordination]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>
* **Funding Insurgencies:** A common tactic to pin down adversaries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>
  * **US:** The CIA belatedly aided Tibetans (1957-1961), but after Chinese road systems were complete, making it ineffective and leading to casualties [[impact_of_technological_change_on_politics | Impact of Technological Change on Politics]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>
  * **China:** Funded Mizo, Manipuri, Naga, and Naxalite insurgencies in India from after the 1962 war until 1979. [[cultural_transmission_knowledge_accumulation_and_social_learning | Cultural transmission, knowledge accumulation, and social learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>
  * **Pakistan:** Supported insurgency in Kashmir. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>
  * **India:** Accused by Pakistan of funding Baloch insurgents and encouraging Pashtun insurgency to divert Pakistani attention from Kashmir. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>
  These actions often led to "frozen conflicts," where outside powers pin an adversary without bearing direct costs, while local populations suffer immensely. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>

## Consequences and Dynamics

### The "Cutthroat Billiards" Metaphor
The speaker uses the metaphor of "five-country cutthroat billiards" to describe the complex interactions, where every ball can be a cue ball, players can join or leave at will, and cooperation is often temporary and self-interested. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>

### Boomerangs and Unintended Consequences
* **For Pakistan:** Wars (1965, 1971, 1999) resulted in no gains, loss of aid, loss of Bangladesh (over half its population), and sanctions. The immense costs could have been invested in development and trade. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>
* **For India:** Alienated the US through diplomatic missteps and perceived anti-Americanism, leading to a declining trend in US support over successive conflicts. Heavy-handed approaches in Kashmir exacerbated the insurgency. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>
* **For China:** Gained territory in the 1962 war but created a permanent enemy in India, foregoing a potentially powerful alliance. The 1971 war contributed to both India's and Pakistan's decisions to pursue nuclear weapons. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>

### Nuclear Proliferation
The dynamics of regional conflicts and superpower rivalries directly fueled nuclear proliferation.
* China's assistance to Pakistan was a key factor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>
* The 1971 war pushed India (vis-à-vis China) and Pakistan (vis-à-vis India) towards developing nuclear weapons. [[comparisons_between_atomic_bomb_development_and_modern_ai_advancements | Comparisons between atomic bomb development and modern AI advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>
* The US often deprioritized non-proliferation when needing Pakistan for other strategic goals (e.g., countering Soviets in Afghanistan). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>

## Strategic Takeaways from the Era

The speaker offers several lessons from these complex interactions: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>
* **Understand Alignments:** Common enemies cannot be conjured. It's crucial to assess the primary objectives, adversaries, and theaters of interest for all potential players.
* **Reassess Often:** Assumptions should be regularly re-evaluated; changing one's mind based on new information is a sign of strength.
* **Expect Veto Players:** In ethnically diverse regions with long-standing conflicts, expect actors who will actively work to prevent resolution.
* **Recognize Unsolvable Problems:** Good strategy involves recognizing that some problems are not feasible to solve with scarce resources. Focus on what is solvable.
* **Power of Alignment:** When great powers align, significant outcomes can be achieved. Similarly, if smaller and medium powers collectively agree, they can compel great powers to pay attention.

The Cold War in South Asia illustrates a period of intense maneuvering, where national interests, ideological clashes, and regional animosities created a volatile and unpredictable environment, leaving lasting legacies for all nations involved.

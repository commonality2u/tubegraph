This article details a simple [[expense_tracking_using_notion | Notion]] template designed for tracking hotel booking reservations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It provides a straightforward way to manage booking information and visualize key data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

At the top of the template, two main KPI sections offer quick insights into bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

*   **Bookings by Room Type**: This section displays the total number of bookings made for various room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Beneath each room type, the number of guests who have booked that specific room is shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Updates to room types in the main table automatically sync with this KPI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests**: This KPI tracks how many guests have requested free pickup services ("Yes") versus those who have not ("No") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Selecting "Yes" or "No" in the corresponding column of the main table updates this summary automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:44">[02:02:44]</a>.

## Booking Information Table

The core of the template is a simple table where detailed guest and booking information can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. As details are added at the bottom, they automatically reflect in the KPIs at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:02">[03:00:02]</a>.

The table includes the following columns:

*   **Guest Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Email ID** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   **Contact Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **Special Request**: A text field for any specific requests from the guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Arrival Date**: This column captures the guest's arrival date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Users have the option to include a specific time along with the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Departure Date**: This column records the guest's departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Like the arrival date, time can also be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Room Type**: A select property where users can choose from pre-defined room types or add new ones by simply typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. New room types added here automatically appear in the top KPI section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Icons for room types can also be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Guest Count**: This numerical field allows users to enter the number of guests for a particular reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Currently, this data is not displayed in the top KPIs, but it can be added with customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup**: A checkbox or select property (Yes/No) to indicate if the guest requires free pickup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The Notion savings funds tracker features a dashboard that includes a "Savings Target" view, where users can [[setting_savings_targets_in_notion | set different saving funds]] and their corresponding goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This template is designed to help users with [[managing_finances_with_notion | managing finances]] and [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | tracking personal finances]] by providing an overview of saved amounts versus targeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Editing Savings Funds

The tracker comes with three default savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Modifying Existing Funds

To edit an already added saving fund:
*   Click on the pencil button next to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   You can then rename the saving fund, for example, changing it to "car fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Similarly, click on the goal amount to set a new target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For instance, you can change a goal amount from $2,500 to $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   Any changes made will automatically update in the savings overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Editing Details from the Fund Entry

Another way to edit details of a saving fund, whether it's a default or a newly added one, is by clicking directly on the fund entry itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   This action will open all available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   From here, you can edit the name (e.g., "car fund new") and set the goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Deleting Savings Funds

To delete a particular saving fund that has been added:
1.  Click on the six dots located on the left side of the fund entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  A "Delete" option will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
3.  Clicking "Delete" will automatically remove the fund from the window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

These actions allow users to effectively manage and customize their savings funds within the Notion tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The template is dynamic and allows for various alterations to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

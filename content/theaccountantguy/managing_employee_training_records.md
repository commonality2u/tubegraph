The Employee Training Expenses Tracker provides a dashboard to manage employee training records and associated expenses. It features two primary views: the training overview and employee records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

The training dashboard offers a quick summary of training activities:
*   **Training Overview** An overview of all planned trainings for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
    *   **Training Date** The date when employees were scheduled to attend a training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
    *   **Employees Count** The number of employees expected to attend a specific training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
    *   **Percentage of Attendance** Indicates the proportion of employees who attended the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
    *   **Training Expense** The cost associated with each training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    All this information is editable and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Employee Records

The employee records section lists employees categorized by their respective departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Department Management**
    *   Departments can be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   New departments can be added using a slider and a plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Employee Training Status**
    *   Each employee's record shows the total number of trainings they've attended out of the total assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   A percentage of attendance is also displayed for each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   Users can specify the "Next Training Date" for an employee, and the system automatically calculates the remaining days until that date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Quick Customization**
    *   Employees can be quickly moved between departments by clicking a three-dot menu and dragging them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Expense Overview

The "expenses overview" panel provides a summary of all training-related costs:

*   **Average Expense** The average expense incurred per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
This data updates automatically as new transaction details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

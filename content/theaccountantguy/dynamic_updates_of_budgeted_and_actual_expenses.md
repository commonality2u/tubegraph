A Notion template is available for [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | tracking business expenses]] related to construction projects, which offers dynamic updates for both [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budgeted]] and [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | actual expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template displays different [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | categories of expenses]] at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Underneath each category, there is a defined [[income_and_expense_tracking_with_budget_targets | budgeted expense amount]] and the [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | actual expenses]] incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Managing Categories and Budgets

*   **Editing Categories**: Categories can be edited by clicking a pencil icon, allowing users to define new categories for their specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Adding Categories**: A new category can be added by clicking on "new page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories**: Categories can be deleted by clicking the three-dot icon and selecting delete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Defining Budgeted Expenses**: The [[income_and_expense_tracking_with_budget_targets | budgeted expense amount]] for each category can be modified by clicking on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Actual Expenses and Dynamic Updates

The [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | actual expenses]] are sourced from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Values in this table can be modified, and as they are updated, the [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | expenses]] are dynamically reflected across the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Changes made in the bottom table automatically update the corresponding categories at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This feature provides a quick and easy way to [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | keep track of a construction project's expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Summary Section

A dedicated summary section provides a comprehensive overview of the financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This section includes:

*   The [[managing_budget_and_expenditure_overview | total budget expense]] that was initially defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   The [[budget_versus_actual_expense_analysis | actual expenses]] pulled from the bottom table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The difference between the [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budgeted]] and [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | actual expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The [[budget_versus_actual_expense_analysis | percentage of actual expenses]] that have been incurred to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The house rent payments tracker template can be utilized to [[house_rent_payments_tracking_with_notion | keep track of your house rental payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Summary Section Views

The template includes a summary section with four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

*   **Property Section**
    *   This view shows different classifications of properties, such as apartment and duplex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   Under each property, you can view the tenant's name and details like the total rent amount, the rent amount that has been paid, the balance rent amount due, and any advanced rent paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This provides a clear overview similar to [[tracking_rent_amounts_and_balances | tracking rent amounts and balances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Rental History**
    *   This view displays the rental history for all tenants who have made payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The history is based on the transactions booked at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Overall Summary**
    *   A dedicated summary section provides key financial figures, including the total amount due, the amount that has been paid, the outstanding rent amount, and the percentage of rent collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This is useful for [[tracking_transactions_and_payment_percentages | tracking transactions and payment percentages]].

## Transaction Section Views

The transaction section offers three distinct views, in addition to a comprehensive view of all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, enabling detailed [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | tracking of transactions and expenses]].

*   **Rent Paid**
    *   This view lists all transactions where rent has been paid, along with the respective tenants and the amounts involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Rent Due**
    *   Here, you can see information for rent that is currently due and has not yet been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   Clicking a checkbox for an entry in this view indicates that the rent has been paid, and it will then move to the "Rent Paid" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Summary**
    *   This view provides a breakdown of rental payments and collections, showing the balance due for every month within a specific quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This aids in [[understanding_quarterly_rental_summaries | understanding quarterly rental summaries]].

A travel expense tracker can be utilized to keep track of all travel expenses and plan ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This system features a summary section that includes accounts, expenses, and an overall summary of all expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Setting Up Expense Categories
The first step is to [[setting_and_modifying_expense_categories | set up different expense categories]] or "expense sources" within the accounts view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Expenses are typically classified under broad categories such as "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. All subsequent expenses are booked under one of these predefined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Adding and Modifying Expense Sources
*   **Adding a New Source**: To quickly add a new expense source, use the "Add expense source" button, which automatically places it under the "Travel" category initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Editing Source Details**: Once added, click the pencil icon to edit the expense source details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, an expense source can be named "Metro" and assigned a budgeted amount, such as $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Moving Sources to Different Categories**: An expense source can be moved to a different main category, such as "Meals," by clicking the three dots next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Adding New Top-Level Categories**: A completely new expense group can be created by clicking the plus sign on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Existing groups can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Setting Budgeted Amounts**: For each expense source, a budgeted amount is set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

> This process allows for [[customizing_expense_categories | customizing expense categories]] and [[setting_expense_categories | setting expense categories]] to meet specific tracking needs.

## Viewing Expense Summaries
The system provides several summary views to [[viewing_and_analyzing_overall_travel_expense_summaries | view and analyze overall travel expense summaries]]:

*   **Individual Expense Source Summary**: This view shows the total expense incurred, the budgeted expense set for that source, and the percentage of the budgeted expense that has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   Expenses exceeding the budgeted amount are indicated in red, for example, a $2,000 flight expense against a $1,000 budget shows as 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Expenses within budget are shown in green, such as $100 spent on breakfast against a $300 budget, reflecting 33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   This provides a quick glance at where expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

*   **Overall Summary**: This section gives a complete overview, including the total budgeted expense, total incurred expense, and the difference between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It also displays the total expenses as a percentage of the total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Booking and Tracking Expenses
Expenses are [[creating_and_categorizing_expenses_in_notion | created and categorized]] under the same three main categories: Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Adding New Expenses
*   **Quick Addition Buttons**: Buttons like "Add travel expense" or "Add lodging expense" allow for quick addition of new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Expense Details**: When adding an expense, the system automatically inputs the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Users then add:
    *   **Description**: A brief detail of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   **Trip Info**: Information about the specific trip, e.g., "Trip to Paris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   **Account (Category)**: The specific sub-category of the expense, such as "Bus," "Metro," "Train," or "Flight" for travel expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: The monetary value of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> If a $100 train expense is booked, it will reflect under the "Train" category in the expense summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. If a budgeted amount of $200 was set for "Train," the system will show that 50% of the budget has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This system facilitates [[organizing_and_categorizing_expenses_in_notion | organizing and categorizing expenses in Notion]], allowing users to understand where their expenses stand and how to plan future expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

This article explains how to utilize an employee schedule template to keep track of employee schedules within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template offers four main views: Employee Details, Task Schedule, Monthly View, and Employee Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Employee Details
The [[employee_details_management | Employee details management]] section lists all employees with relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Employees
To [[adding_and_managing_employee_records | add a new employee]], users can click the "new" button and enter details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
Employees can be categorized into departments such as operations, marketing, and finance, with the option to add or edit new categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
When adding a new employee, users input their name, employee ID, and contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Further details like department, position, and email ID can also be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. A "quick action" button is also available to automatically add a new employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Task Schedule
After [[employee_details_management | employee details]] are added, users proceed to the task schedule section to enter task-related information for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Managing Shifts and Tasks
Tasks are organized into different shifts (e.g., first, second, third) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. For each task, users can specify a desired start and end time and indicate the period to which the time belongs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Task details are entered, and the relevant employee can be selected from those added earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Employees can also be added directly from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The respective department is automatically displayed for each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Tracking Attendance and Task Status
The template [[recording_and_tracking_attendance_in_training_sessions | automatically computes the hours worked]] on a specific task based on the entered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Employees can mark their [[recording_and_tracking_attendance_in_training_sessions | attendance]] as present, on leave, or day off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. They can also update the task status (e.g., in progress, completed, not started) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. For scenarios like a day off or leave, the task status can be marked as "not applicable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Monthly View
The monthly view provides an overview of performance, dividing months into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. It displays the total hours worked for a specific month, total hours on leave, and the overall total hours (sum of worked and leave hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This offers a quick summary of overall monthly performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Employee Performance
For individual performance tracking, the employee performance section shows the same information as the monthly view but broken down by each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This allows users to see hours worked, hours on leave, and total hours for each specific employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

The employee schedule template is designed to help keep track of employees' work schedules and facilitate [[using_notion_for_employee_scheduling | work scheduling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The template is fully customizable to suit specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

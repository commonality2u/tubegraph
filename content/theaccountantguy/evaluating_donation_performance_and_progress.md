A Notion-based [[charity_donation_tracking_using_notion | charity donation tracker]] allows users to monitor all their contributions to charity, providing a clear overview of financial progress towards [[managing_donation_goals_and_timelines | donation goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The tracker is divided into three main sections: Fund Setup, Donations Overview, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The initial step involves [[setting_up_funds_and_categories_for_donations | setting up funds and categories]] for donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
Users can:
*   **Categorize donations**: Pre-defined categories include Health, Environment, and Education, which can be edited or new ones added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Add specific funds**: Under each category, individual funds (e.g., American Red Cross, Sierra Club) can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Define fund details**: For each fund, users input:
    *   **Name of the fund** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   **Opening balance**: Donations made at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   **[[managing_donation_goals_and_timelines | Targeted donation]]**: The desired total donation amount for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   **Start date**: When donations began for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   **[[managing_donation_goals_and_timelines | Target date]]**: The deadline to reach the targeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Tracking Recent Donations

The "Recent Donations" section tracks all contributions month-wise, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
For each donation entry, users record:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Period** (month/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Fund**: Select from the funds set up previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Recommended Figure**: The system automatically calculates how much needs to be contributed each month to reach the [[managing_donation_goals_and_timelines | targeted donation amount]] by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The actual donation made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Performance Check**: A checkmark appears if the donation amount exceeds or meets the recommended monthly contribution, while a crossmark indicates a shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview

The "Quarterly Overview" visually summarizes donations by month, grouped into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Monthly Totals**: Displays the total donations made versus the total requirement for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Color-Coding**:
    *   **Red**: Signifies that donations are falling short of the monthly requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
    *   **Green**: Indicates that enough donations have been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   **Blue**: Means the donation amount exactly matches the requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Completion**: Shows the percentage of the monthly requirement met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Sums**: Total donations made for all months combined within a quarter are displayed at the top of each quarter's section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Donations Overview

This view provides a specific, fund-wise breakdown of donation progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
For each fund, it shows:
*   **Total donation amount**: Includes both the opening balance and any subsequent donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Target amount**: The overall goal for that specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Percentage reached**: How much of the [[managing_donation_goals_and_timelines | targeted amount]] has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Time remaining**: The number of months left until the [[managing_donation_goals_and_timelines | targeted end date]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This value updates automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Contribution required per month**: The average monthly contribution needed from the start date to the end date to meet the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Category-wise total contributions**: Sums of donations made across all funds within a specific category (e.g., Health, Environment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Summary Section

The "Summary" section provides a high-level overview of overall donation performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
It displays:
*   **Total donation required**: The sum of all individual fund targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Total donation made so far**: The accumulated total from all contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Shortfall**: The difference between the total required and total made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Overall percentage reached**: The overall progress towards all [[managing_donation_goals_and_timelines | donation goals]] combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Customization

The entire dashboard can be adjusted to any preferred [[customizing_donation_tracker_with_currency_options | currency options]] that Notion supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

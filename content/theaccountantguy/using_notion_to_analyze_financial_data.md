This guide details how to [[Using Notion for financial management | utilize a Notion monthly budget planner]] for [[Using Notion for budgeting | budgeting]] and [[Using Notion for expense management | expense management]], allowing for comprehensive financial data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system is designed to provide clear overviews and detailed insights into spending and budget adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Overview of Financial Tracking Views

The monthly budget planner offers four main views to help [[Using Notion to monitor financial summaries and net worth | monitor financial summaries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

*   **Expenses Overview** This view provides a summary of different expense categories, such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it displays the total expense amount, the budgeted amount, the percentage of the budgeted amount incurred, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is still under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview** Presents all tracked expenses in a monthly format, with months categorized for easy viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** Shows the same expense information as the monthly overview, but presented in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** Offers a complete expense overview structured by year, consolidating all expenses to provide a clear picture of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Data Entry and Budget Setting

All financial information is entered into an "expense details database" which automatically populates the different overview sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Entering Transactions

Transactions are entered into the expense details database, where they are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with the most recent months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

To add a new transaction:
1.  Click on the "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
2.  Enter the date (e.g., February 1, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The system automatically adjusts for the month based on the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Specify the expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
4.  Select the period (e.g., "Feb 2024") and the year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. New periods can be added if not already displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Choose the expense category (e.g., "utilities"). Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
6.  Assign an expense code, which segregates expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
7.  Input the expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The database has separate columns for actual expense amount and budget amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### [[Using Notion for budgeting | Setting a Budget]]

Budgets are set at the beginning of each month in the same expense details database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

To set a budget:
1.  Select the date (e.g., February 1 for the start of the month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense name for which the budget is being set (e.g., "food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the period (e.g., "February") and the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Choose the category (e.g., "food"). For budget entries, the expense name and category name should generally be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
5.  Input the budget amount into the "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
6.  Once entered, all figures in the overviews automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Data

After booking expenses, the system allows for detailed financial analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Detailed Views

*   **Period View:** Clicking on a specific period (e.g., "Feb 2024") reveals a new window showing all transactions for that period, including the amount and whether it was a budget or an expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This provides a quick glance at the financial activity within that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Year View:** Clicking on a year (e.g., "2024") displays the budgeted amount, actual expenses, expenses as a percentage of budget, and budget status for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It also lists all transactions for the year, specifying the amount and whether it's a budget or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Category View:** Selecting a category shows how much has been spent for that particular category, including the expense amount, budgeted amount, percentage, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It also lists all booked expenses and budget amounts related to that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View:** Using the expense code allows users to see the total amount booked for a specific category within a particular month, compared to its budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

By continuously adding expense information, the overviews are automatically updated, providing a dynamic view of monthly financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. These different views enable users to track and understand their finances effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

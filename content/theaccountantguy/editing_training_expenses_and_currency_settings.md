## Editing Training Expenses

The tracker provides various views to monitor and edit training expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:

*   **Training Overview** The "Training Overview" displays the "training expense" for each individual training session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Expenses Overview** An "expenses overview" section reflects the total expense incurred for all trainings and calculates the average expense per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This information updates automatically as transaction details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Training Expenses Section**
    *   To edit specific training expenses, navigate to the "training expenses" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   Click the pencil icon next to a training to edit its expense information directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Any changes made will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. For example, a training expense of $1,400 can be updated to $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   The view can also be changed to a "table view" by clicking the three-dot menu, which allows for quick editing of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Changing Currency Settings

*   **Individual Property Currency**

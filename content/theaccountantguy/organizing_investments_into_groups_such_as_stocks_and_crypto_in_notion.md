The Investment Portfolio Tracker in Notion allows users to categorize and manage their investments effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of a user's holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Investment Section Overview

The tracker features an investment section where holdings are categorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. By default, this section is divided into "stocks" and "cryptos," but users have the flexibility to add their own custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. For each investment added, users must input the opening balance and the opening units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Portfolio Section and Fund Allocation

Once investments are entered into the investment section, the portfolio section reflects these holdings, classified under their respective categories like stocks, cryptos, or any other user-defined groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This section displays the investment value and available units after all transactions are carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It also indicates the investment percentage, showing each specific investment's proportion of the total portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. A dedicated profit/loss section shows the total profit or loss for each investment after transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, with a summation of profit or loss for each section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This functionality is crucial for [[fund_allocation_and_management_in_notion | fund allocation and management in Notion]].

## Adding and Classifying Investments

Users can quickly add new investments using a quick action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Clicking "add investment" generates a new entry, which can then be detailed by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This allows for inputting the investment name, opening balance, and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Initially, new investments might be listed under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. To classify an investment, users can click a three-dot icon and move it to an existing category like stocks or crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Creating New Categories
To create a new investment category, users can click the plus icon, which prompts them to create a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. For example, typing "bonds" will automatically add a new section for bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Existing items can also be edited by clicking on them and typing the desired changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This flexibility highlights the robust features for [[setting_up_investment_categories_in_notion | setting up investment categories in Notion]].

## Transaction Section

The tracker also includes a transaction section to record all investment activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It offers different views, including "all" (showing both buy and sell transactions), "buy," "sell," and "profit and loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. For each transaction, users input the date, description, transaction type (buy or sell), the associated investment account (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin), the number of units, and the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The amount is automatically calculated by multiplying units by price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The profit and loss view specifically shows the profit or loss generated from each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For example, if 30 units of Apple stock were sold for $40 each, and bought for $10 each, a profit of $900 would be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Quick action buttons are also available to rapidly add buy or sell investment entries, automatically picking the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

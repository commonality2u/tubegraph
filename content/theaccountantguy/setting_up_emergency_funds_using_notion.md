The template features three main sections for managing emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
1.  **Fund Setup**: Where you define your emergency fund categories and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
2.  **Savings Overview**: Provides a summary of all savings made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section**: Reflects total savings and necessary contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Fund Setup
The "Fund Setup" section allows users to categorize their emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Default Categories**: The template comes with three predefined categories: "Financial Safety," "Asset Protection," and "Health and Wellness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Customization**: Users can [[customizing_emergency_fund_templates_in_notion | edit existing categories]] or add new ones by clicking on the category name or the "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Adding a New Fund
To add a new emergency fund:
1.  Click the "add font" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A new fund will automatically appear under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
2.  Move the new fund to its respective category by clicking the three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  Click the pencil icon associated with the fund to input details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
    *   **Fund Detail**: A description for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   **Starting Balance**: The initial amount in the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   **Goal Amount**: The targeted savings for this specific emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   **Start Date**: The date you begin contributing to this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   **Target End Date**: The date by which you aim to have the full emergency fund available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   The template automatically calculates savings made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Contribution Section
This section is where you record monthly contributions to your emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Monthly View**: Contributions are divided by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. It also shows the number of contributions made for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Contribution Details**: For each entry, you can specify:
    *   **Date**: The date of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   **Description**: A brief note about the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   **Period**: The month of the contribution (predefined for 2023, can be extended for other years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    *   **Fund**: Select the specific emergency fund from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: The amount of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

A checkmark appears if the contribution meets or exceeds the required amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. For example, contributing $900 to a job loss fund when the requirement was $643 will show a tick mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Button**: Use the "new button" to automatically add a new line item for the current month and date, with formulas already linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

*   **Months Left**: The remaining time until the target end date, calculated from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Contribution Required Per Month**: The calculated monthly contribution needed to meet the fund's goal by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

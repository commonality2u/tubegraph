Within Notion, you can [[finding_difference_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference between two numbers]] in a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This can be achieved through two different formulas: the [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | use of the subtract operator]] or the [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | use of the minus sign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Database Setup

To begin, you need to create a database. This is done by typing a forward slash and then selecting "database" from the list of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

Within this database:
*   The first property is typically a title property, which describes the action being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   You will then need to assign number properties to the two numbers you wish to compare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Applying the Minus Sign Formula

Once your database is set up with two number properties, you can use a formula property to [[finding_difference_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference]]. The minus sign provides a direct way to calculate the difference between the two numbers in your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

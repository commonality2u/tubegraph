The "Inventory Setup" section of an inventory management template, designed for [[tracking_inventory_for_small_businesses | small businesses]], provides the foundational structure for organizing and categorizing various inventory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is one of three primary views within the overall [[inventory_portfolio_and_transactions | inventory portfolio]] system, alongside the "Inventory Portfolio" and "Inventory Status" views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Inventory Classifications
Within the inventory setup, items are categorized into three main classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>:
*   **Raw Materials:** Unprocessed goods used in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Work in Progress:** Partially completed goods that are still undergoing production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Finished Goods:** Completed products ready for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Inventory Item Details
For each inventory item added to the system, specific details are recorded:
*   **Opening Balance:** The starting value of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units:** The initial count of inventory units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Valuation Principle:** Options include FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), and WAC (Weighted Average Cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This setting can be left as is without affecting other reporting if not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Reorder Level:** The threshold number of units at which an inventory item should be reordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, wheat might have a reorder level of 60 units, and corn, 10 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. If the stock drops below this level, a "low stock" message will appear in the [[inventory_portfolio_and_transactions | inventory portfolio]] view, prompting reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Percentage:** Indicates the proportion of a particular inventory item relative to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Adding and Managing Inventory
To add a new inventory item, a user can click an "add inventory" button, which automatically places the new item in a "no classification" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. From there, it can be moved to a specific category (e.g., "work in progress") by dragging and dropping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Once categorized, the user can click an edit icon to input the detailed values for the item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

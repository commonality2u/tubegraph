This article provides a walkthrough of a [[overview_of_business_expense_tracker | business expense tracker]] designed to help keep all your business expenses organized under one general ledger (GL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Expense Categories

The tracker allows you to define and manage different expense categories incurred by your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

*   **Predefined Categories** The tracker comes with some predefined expense heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Modifying Categories** You can modify or change existing categories by clicking on them and then clicking "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Editing Subcategories** To change a subcategory, simply click the pencil icon next to it and edit the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories** A new category of your choice can be added by clicking on "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **[[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | Setting Budgeted Amounts]]** Once categories are set, you can [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | set the budgeted amount]] of expense for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. These amounts will automatically be reflected later in the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, changing a budgeted amount for "advertising" from $100 to $5,000 will update the expenses overview accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Expenses Overview

The "expenses overview" section provides a summary of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

*   **Tracking Budget vs. Actual** Here, you can see the [[budget vs actual expenses tracking | total expenses]] incurred, the [[budgeted vs actual expenses tracking | budget expenses]] that were set, and a percentage reflecting whether you have exceeded or stayed within your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Updates** Any changes made to budgeted amounts in the expense categories will automatically update in the expenses overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Transaction Entry

The "transaction side" is where you enter individual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

*   **Entering Details** You can choose the date, which will automatically populate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Expense Information** You can then input a description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Account Selection** Select from your predefined accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Amount** Finally, enter the amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Summary

On the left side of the tracker, a summary provides a quick glance at key financial figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

*   **Key Metrics** This summary displays the budgeted expense, the total expense, the difference between the two, and the percentage of the budgeted expense that has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

This tracker is designed to be a simple tool for [[tracking_and_summarizing_business_finances | tracking your business expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The employee schedule template in [[Using Notion for Business Tracking | Notion]] can be utilized to keep track of employee schedules and their overall performance within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This template includes specific views designed for monthly and individual employee performance tracking.

## Monthly View

The "Monthly View" section of the template provides a summarized look at performance data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. In this view, months are organized into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

For each month, users can see:
*   The total hours an employee has worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   The total hours an employee has been on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   The overall total hours, which is the sum of both working hours and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

This view offers a quick overview of monthly performance and how employees have performed in totality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

## Employee Performance Section

To see individual employee performance, the "Employee Performance" section provides a detailed breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This view displays the same information as the monthly view, but specifically for each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

For every employee, the template shows:
*   The hours they have worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   The hours they have been on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   Their total hours in totality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

This allows for easy tracking of individual contributions and attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### Customization
The employee schedule template is fully customizable to meet specific organizational needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

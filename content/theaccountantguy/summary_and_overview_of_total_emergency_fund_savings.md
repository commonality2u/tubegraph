The emergency fund tracker template provides a comprehensive overview of your savings, divided into key sections that allow for granular tracking and overall assessment of your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Summary Section Overview

The template features a top-level summary section that encompasses three main components:
*   Fund setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   [[Dashboard overview for assessing financial goals | Savings overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   [[Using a summary section to track payment totals | A summary section]] reflecting total savings and required contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

## Savings Overview Section

The [[Dashboard overview for assessing financial goals | savings overview]] section further categorizes savings into three classifications, with individual line items for each emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This section displays several key metrics for each fund:

*   **Total Savings** This figure represents the sum of the fund's starting balance and all contributions made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. For example, a job loss fund with a $500 starting balance and $900 in contributions would show a total savings of $1,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings** This amount is directly linked to the [[editing_and_managing_savings_goals | goal amount]] set during the fund setup phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved** The percentage of the total savings requirement that has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings Date** The specific end date by which the total emergency fund is intended to be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Months Left** Calculated from the current date to the targeted end date, this metric indicates the remaining time to achieve the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This value updates automatically as time passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Contribution Required Per Month** This figure indicates the monthly contribution necessary to reach the targeted fund amount by the set end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Overall Summary Section

At the top of the template, the [[using_a_summary_section_to_track_payment_totals | summary section]] provides a concise overview of your entire emergency fund status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

*   **Total Savings** This is the cumulative sum of all opening balances across all funds and all contributions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Savings Required** This is the total of all targeted savings amounts set for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Difference** The variance between the total savings accumulated and the total savings required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved** The overall percentage of your total targeted savings that has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. For example, if $10,350 has been saved towards a $40,000 target, it shows 26% achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

This [[using_a_summary_section_to_track_payment_totals | summary section]] offers a complete snapshot of your financial progress towards all emergency fund goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

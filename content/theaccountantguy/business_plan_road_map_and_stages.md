This business plan template helps streamline the [[financial_planning|planning]] process for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It offers two primary views: the Business Plan Road Map and the [[using_events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Business Plan Road Map View

The Business Plan Road Map breaks down the entire [[financial_planning|business planning]] process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

*   **Stages Defined** There are 11 predefined stages, ranging from "Conceptual Research" to "Profitability and Scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Users can customize these stages by clicking on a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Defining Objectives** For each business plan, specific objectives can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These objectives can be associated with a particular stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Completion Tracking** Each business plan or stage has a completion percentage, which updates automatically as tasks are completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Managing Stages and Tasks

Clicking on any stage within the Business Plan Road Map reveals a detailed view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

*   **Associated Tasks** Each stage lists various tasks associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For example, "Conception and Research" might have two distinct tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Task Details** For each task, users can specify a deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, mark it as completed using a checkbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, and assign a status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. New tasks can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Documentation** A documentation section is available at the bottom of each stage view, allowing users to specify objectives and tasks in detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Automatic Progress Update** As tasks are marked complete, the completion percentage for the corresponding stage automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, if two tasks are present and one is completed, the stage shows 50% completion; completing both tasks results in 100% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## [[using_events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]] View

The [[using_events_timeline_for_business_planning | Events Timeline]] provides a visual, calendar-like overview of all planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

*   **Calendar/Timeline Format** This view displays specific deadline dates for stages and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Displayed Information** Users can see the stage name, associated tasks, dates, and status for each event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This provides a quick overview of upcoming plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Navigation** Arrows on the timeline reflect specific dates and allow users to navigate to and view details for all stages and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

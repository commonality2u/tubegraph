This article details a Notion template designed to [[tracking_savings_and_contributions_for_sinking_funds | track emergency funds]] and monitor progress towards savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Template Overview
The template includes a summary section at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, a savings overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, and a summary reflecting savings and required contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Fund Setup
The "Fund Setup" section allows users to define and organize their emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
### Categories
Funds are initially divided into three categories:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

### Adding New Funds
New funds can be added by clicking the "add fund" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Contributions are grouped by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Each month indicates the number of contributions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

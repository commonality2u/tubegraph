This article outlines how to [[automating_debt_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | set up automated debt payment reminders]] that are delivered via WhatsApp notifications, including options for repetition and customization. The system was demonstrated by Sanam Biswal, known as "the accountant guide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Core Functionality

The system sends a notification to your WhatsApp on the due date of a loan payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Notification Example
A typical message includes a "Debt Payment Reminder Alert," specifying the loan type (e.g., car loan), due date, and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For instance, a reminder for a $3,000 car loan due on September 23 would state: "Hi there, this is a reminder for payment of car loan which is due on September 23 for an amount of three thousand dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Instant Payment Link
Notifications can include a payment link that redirects users to their bank portal or a service like PayPal, allowing for instant loan repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Any relevant payment link can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## [[steps_for_scheduling_payment_reminders_with_repetition | Setting up Repeating Reminders]]

To receive these debt payment reminders on WhatsApp, you need to create a template for each loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Creating a Template
1.  Click on the "new template" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  Enter the loan details, such as "car loan" and the repayment amount of "$3,000" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Specifying Repetition
Once a template is added, there's an option for "repeating this template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This feature automatically populates all specified values within the template for a recurring period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Monthly Repetition**: To receive reminders each month, select "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Specific Day**: Choose a specific day of the month for the information to repeat itself (e.g., the 16th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This ensures the line item is added to the database automatically on that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Adjusting Notification Timing
You can specify when to receive the notification relative to the loan's due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Advance Notification**: To receive a notification a certain number of days before the due date (e.g., 7 days prior), input that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **On Due Date**: To receive the notification on the exact due date, set this value to "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Setting a recurring template for each loan will cause the system to automatically trigger an automation every month, sending the payment notification message to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Automation in Action

The system can automatically add new loan entries based on recurring templates and trigger WhatsApp notifications. For example, if an "education loan" is set to appear on September 16 at 3:55 PM, a new loan entry will automatically populate in the system, and a payment alert will be sent to WhatsApp around that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This demonstrates how a new loan entry's appearance triggers the automated message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Customization and Management

*   **Scalability**: This automation can be set up for any number of loans you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Custom Messages**: Users can create custom messages according to their requirements, making the system completely customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Template Deletion**: Once a loan has been repaid, you can simply delete its template to stop repeated notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

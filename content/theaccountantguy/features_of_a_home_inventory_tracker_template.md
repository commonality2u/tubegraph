The Home Inventory Tracker is a simple Notion template designed to [[using_notion_for_home_inventory_tracking | keep track of home inventory]] in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Overview Metrics

On the left side of the template, key metrics provide a quick summary of inventory status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:
*   Total estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   The difference between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   The total percentage of purchases made compared to the estimated purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

## Main Sections

The right side of the template is organized into three distinct sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>:

### Inventory Categories
This section allows users to set up different categories for their inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples provided include "Dairy and Eggs," "Medicines," and "Fruits and Veggies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   Under each main category, subcategories can be listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Users can also define an estimated budgeted purchase for each subcategory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Inventory Overview
The inventory overview provides details for each subcategory of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, including:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Percentage of total units consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

### Transaction Section
This section is used to record and [[tracking_purchases_and_consumption_in_home_inventory | specify inventory transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Users can enter details for purchased items, such as "cheese purchase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   Clicking on an entry reveals subcategory items and the amount of purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   Entries can also be added for items that have been consumed, specifying the number of units used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Automation and Customization
All transaction entries automatically update the relevant sections of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, allowing users to continuously track available inventory and consumption needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

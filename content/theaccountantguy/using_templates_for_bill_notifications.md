This article demonstrates how to set up recurring bill payment reminders directly on WhatsApp using a template system and automation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Setting Up a Bill Payment Reminder

To create a new bill payment reminder, you start by creating a new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Creating a New Template
1.  Click on the drop-down menu and select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
2.  Enter the name of the bill, for example, "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
3.  Specify the bill amount; for instance, fifteen hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Setting Recurring Payments
Once the bill details are entered, you can set it to repeat on a recurring basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This feature is crucial for [[creating_templates_for_recurring_payment_reminders | creating templates for recurring payment reminders]] and [[using_templates_for_subscription_payment_reminders | using templates for subscription payment reminders]].
1.  Click on the drop-down menu again and select the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
2.  Set the bill to repeat, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
3.  Specify the exact time and day when you wish to receive the notification, for instance, 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
4.  Save the settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This setup will automatically send notifications every month on the specified date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

The system requires the help of automation software like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A detailed explanation and guide for setting up the entire automation workflow in Pabbly Connect is included when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This highlights the general concept of [[creating_and_using_templates_for_document_generation | creating and using templates for document generation]].

## WhatsApp Notifications

Once the automation is set up and the template is configured for recurring notifications, you will automatically receive bill notifications on your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For example, if a "Mobile bill" is set to notify on the 20th of September at 11:55 AM, a notification will appear shortly after that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, usually within a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The inventory tracking template for small businesses includes an "Inventory Setup" section to define and organize your inventory into distinct categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This feature supports [[managing_inventory_categories_and_subcategories | managing inventory categories and subcategories]] for better organization.

## Inventory Classifications

The inventory setup initially provides three main classifications for inventory:
*   **Raw Materials** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   **Work in Progress** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **Finished Goods** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

For each inventory item added to a category, specific details can be recorded:
*   **Opening Balance** Indicates the starting balance of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units** The initial quantity of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Evaluation Principle** Options include FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), and WSC (Weighted Average Cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. If unfamiliar, this can be left as is without affecting other reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Reorder Level** The threshold quantity of units at which the inventory should be reordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, wheat might have a reorder level of 60 units, and corn 10 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Percentage** Shows the proportion of a particular inventory item relative to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Adding and Assigning Inventory

To add a new inventory item:
1.  Click the "add inventory" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  The new item will initially appear in a "no classification" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  To assign it to a category, click the three dots next to the item and drag it to the desired category (e.g., "Work in Progress") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
4.  Once added, click the pencil icon to input its specific values and details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Customizing Inventory Status Categories

Beyond the primary inventory classifications, the "Inventory Status" view also allows for customization of categories that track the physical location or state of inventory (e.g., "in transit," "in progress," "not sent") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

To edit or add new status categories:
1.  Click on an existing status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
2.  To add a new status, click the plus button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
3.  This principle of editing and adding applies consistently across the three main inventory views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

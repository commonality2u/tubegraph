This article details how to utilize a Notion-based Investment Portfolio tracker to manage and track investments, including individual transactions and overall portfolio performance. The tracker is designed to provide an overview of investments, track specific transactions, and calculate profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Investment Portfolio Overview

The Investment Portfolio tracker in Notion includes several key sections for comprehensive investment management:
*   **Portfolio Section** This section provides a summary of all investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Transactions Section** This section lists all individual investment-related transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Buttons** These buttons facilitate quick additions of new investments or transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Managing Investments

The "Investment" section is structured to categorize and monitor different types of investments.

### Investment Categories
Investments are typically divided into categories such as "stocks" and "cryptos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Users can also add their own custom categories, like "bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Initial Setup
For each investment added, users must input the opening balance and opening units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Portfolio Performance
Once initial data is entered, the portfolio section updates to show:
*   **Investment Value** The current value of each investment after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Units Available** The number of units remaining after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Investment Percentage** The proportion of a specific investment relative to the total portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss** A detailed profit and loss figure for each investment, reflecting gains or losses after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The total sum of profit or loss for each section is also displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Investments
*   **Adding New Investments** Use the "Add Investment" quick action button to add a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Clicking the pencil icon allows users to input details like opening balance and units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. New investments can be classified under existing categories like stocks or crypto, or a new category can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Investments** Existing investment details can be modified by clicking on the item and typing in changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Tracking Investment Transactions

The transaction section allows users to track all investment activities. It features multiple views to organize and analyze transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Transaction Views
The transaction section offers four distinct views:
*   **All** This view displays all types of investment transactions, including both buy and sell orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Buy** This view focuses specifically on investment purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Sell** This view is dedicated to investment sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Profit & Loss** This view summarizes the profit or loss generated from each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Transaction Details
For every transaction, users need to input:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   **Type of Transaction** (e.g., buy, sell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   **Investment Account** The specific investment (e.g., Apple stock, Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
*   **Number of Units** (e.g., 30 units sold, 50 units bought) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   **Price** This field is automatically calculated based on user input in the "Buy" or "Sell" sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Amount** This is calculated by multiplying the units by the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Calculating Profit and Loss
The "Profit & Loss" view provides specific data points for analysis:
*   **Sales Value** For sell transactions, the total sales value is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Buy Price** This information is added in this section to determine profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss Generated** The tracker calculates the profit or loss by comparing the sell price to the original buy price, multiplied by the number of units transacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. For example, selling 30 units bought at $10 for $40 each generates a $900 profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Quick Transaction Entry
*   **Buy Investment** Clicking the "Buy Investment" quick action button automatically adds a new entry under the "Buy" view with the current date, allowing users to fill in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Sell Investment** Similarly, the "Sell Investment" button creates a new entry under the "Sell" view, ready for transaction information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

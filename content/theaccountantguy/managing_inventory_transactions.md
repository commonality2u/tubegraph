The Home Inventory tracker is a simple template designed to [[tracking_inventory_for_small_businesses | keep track of all home inventory]] in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool is built to help users manage their inventory efficiently, including [[adding_transactions_to_track_income_and_expenses | recording transactions]] for both purchases and consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Key Features for Transaction Management

The system includes a dedicated "transaction section" where users can specify every [[inventory_portfolio_and_transactions | inventory transaction]] that occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Recording Purchases
When an inventory item is purchased, such as cheese, the system allows users to record:
*   The specific [[inventory_setup_and_classification | subcategory item]] purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   The total amount of the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Recording Consumption
The template also supports tracking the consumption of inventory items:
*   Users can add an entry to specify when an item, like cheese, is being consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   A dedicated column allows specifying the number of "items used" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Automatic Updates and Overview
Once [[entering_and_managing_transactions_for_small_businesses | all transaction entries]] are made, the system automatically updates various subsections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This provides an updated overview of:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   The percentage of total units consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This functionality helps users [[tracking_payment_transactions_and_updates | keep a track of]] available inventory and required consumption for every item in their home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Customization
The template is entirely customizable to meet specific user requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Further customization assistance is available by reaching out via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

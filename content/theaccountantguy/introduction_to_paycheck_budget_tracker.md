The paycheck budget tracker is designed to help users track their paycheck payments and budget them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Key Sections

The tracker is divided into two primary sections: the Summary section on the left and the Account section on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Summary Section

The Summary section provides an overview of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It displays:
*   Total budgeted expenses set by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Account Section

The Account section allows users to categorize and manage their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Expenses can be added under three default categories:
*   Fixed Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

Users have the flexibility to change these category "heads" to different items as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. After adding accounts, a budgeted amount can be set for each expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This categorization contributes to the [[sections_in_the_paycheck_tracker__records_payments_and_summary | records payments and summary]] functionality of the tracker.

## Transaction Management

After setting up accounts and budgeted amounts, users can navigate to the Transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Here, all transactions related to every expense can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. These transactions are then reflected under the expense section, showing the total budgeted amount, incurred expenses, and the percentage of the budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Quick Action Buttons

The tracker includes quick action buttons to streamline data entry:
*   **Add Transaction**: Automatically creates a new transaction entry with the current date, allowing users to quickly input details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Add Expense Source**: Automatically adds a new expense under one of the main categories. This new expense can then be moved to a different head as required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

This system helps users utilize the paycheck budget tracker to keep track of budgeted payments and stay on top of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

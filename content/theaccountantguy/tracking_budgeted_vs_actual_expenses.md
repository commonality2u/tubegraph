The Notion Expenses Tracker allows users to manage all their expenses in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This template is designed for [[tracking income and expenses effectively | tracking income and expenses]], whether for personal use or business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Categories and Expense Entry

The tracker features a category section at the top, which can be defined to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Users can rename categories by hovering over them and clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Existing categories can be edited or deleted via a three-dot menu, and new categories can be added by clicking "new page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

For each category, there is a [[budget_versus_actual_expense_tracking | budgeted expense amount]] and an [[budget_versus_actual_expense_tracking | actual expense amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. As amounts are entered into the expense list, all categories are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## [[Overview of expenses and budget tracking | Expense and Budget Summary]]

The [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | summary section]] provides a clear [[budgeted_expenses_summary | overview of expenses and budget tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It displays:
*   The [[budgeted_expenses_summary | budgeted expense amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   The actual expenses amount (computed from the expense table) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   The [[calculating_expense_differences_and_budget_percentages | difference]] between the budget and actual spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   The [[calculating_expense_differences_and_budget_percentages | percentage of the budget that has been spent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

## [[Setting and adjusting budgeted amounts | Setting and Adjusting Budgeted Amounts]]

Users can set their own [[setting_and_adjusting_budgeted_amounts | budgeted expense amounts]] by clicking on the budget expense field within each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Changes made here will update the total budget reflected in the summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The Notion Expenses Tracker is entirely customizable, allowing users to adapt it to their specific [[tracking income and expenses | income and expense tracking]] requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The Home Inventory tracker is a simple template designed to help users keep track of all their home inventory in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It provides an overview of total estimated purchases, actual purchases made, the difference between them, and the percentage of purchases compared to the estimated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Inventory Categories and Subcategories

The template allows users to [[setting_up_inventory_categories | set up different categories of inventory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of categories include "Darian eggs, medicines, and fruits and veggies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Under each main category, [[setting_up_inventory_categories | subcategories]] can be listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For each subcategory, users can specify an estimated budgeted purchase amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Inventory Overview

The "Inventory Overview" section provides key metrics for all inventory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This section displays:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Percentage of total units consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

These metrics are applicable to all listed subcategory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction section" is where users can [[tracking_inventory_status_and_transactions | specify inventory transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. When a transaction like a "cheese purchase" is recorded, users can select the specific subcategory item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The amount of purchase made is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

When an inventory item is consumed, a new entry can be added to specify the item and the number of items used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. All transaction entries automatically update the inventory overview, allowing users to track available inventory and consumption requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

This guide explains how to utilize a monthly budget planner in Notion to [[budgeting_and_tracking_in_notion | budget]] for each month and track expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Overview of the Budget Planner

The Notion monthly budget planner features four distinct views to help you manage your finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

*   **Expenses Overview**: Displays specific expense categories (e.g., shopping, entertainment, food, utilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it shows the total expense amount, the budgeted amount, the percentage of the total budgeted amount incurred, and a status indicating whether you are over or under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview**: Presents all discussed expenses in a monthly format, categorizing months and allowing you to see all expenses at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview**: Shows the same expense information as the monthly overview but presented in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary**: Provides a complete yearly expense overview, consolidating all expenses to give insight into your financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Recording Transactions

To use the planner, you will primarily interact with the `Expense Details` database, where all information is entered for daily expense calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Expenses in this database are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with later months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Steps to Enter a Transaction:

1.  Click the "new" button within the `Expense Details` database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the **date** of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This date will automatically update the associated month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Provide an **expense detail**, such as "Wi-Fi expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Select the **period** (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. New periods can be added if not already displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the **year** (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  Choose the **category** of the expense (e.g., "utilities") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. You can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
7.  Input an **expense code**, which is used to segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Enter the **expense amount** in the `expense amount` column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This column is specifically for booking the actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Setting Budgets

The planner includes a `budget amount` column, used at the start of the month to set a budget for specific expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Steps to Set a Budget:

1.  Select the **date** at the start of the month (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  Enter the **expense name** for which you are setting the budget (e.g., "food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the **period** (e.g., "February") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Select the **year** (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
5.  Choose the **category** (e.g., "food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. When [[setting_and_tracking_budget_goals_with_notion | setting a budget]], ensure the expense name and category name are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
6.  Input the **expense code** following the same category and month format (e.g., "food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
7.  Enter the **budget amount** in the `budget column` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once you enter budget information, all figures in the overviews will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. As you continue to add expense information, the views will automatically update, providing more insight into your monthly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Analyzing Your Finances

After [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | booking expenses]], you can extract detailed information from various views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>:

*   **By Period**: Clicking on a specific period (e.g., "Feb 2024") reveals a new window showing all transactions for that period, including amounts and whether they were budget or actual expense amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **By Year**: Clicking on the year provides a similar view, displaying budgeted amounts, expense amounts, expenses as a percentage, and budget status for the entire year, along with all yearly transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **By Category**: You can see how much has been spent for a particular category, including expense amount, budgeted amount, percentage, and status, along with related transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **By Expense Code**: The expense code allows you to track the amount booked for a specific category and month in comparison to the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

These views help you to [[using_notion_for_budgeting | track]] and [[managing_accounts_for_personal_finances_in_notion | understand]] your financial situation at the time of booking transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The paycheck budget tracker organizes expenses under three primary categories or "heads": fixed expenses, variable expenses, and savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Users can define and customize these categories to suit their individual budgeting needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Account Section
Under the account section of the tracker, users can [[adding_and_managing_expense_sources | add their own expenses]] and assign them to one of these three heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For each expense, a budgeted amount can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The system allows for flexibility, enabling users to change the predefined names of these heads if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Managing Expense Sources
The tracker includes quick action buttons to streamline the process of [[adding_and_managing_expense_sources | adding and managing expense sources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. An "add expense source" button automatically adds a new expense under one of these main categories, typically defaulting to fixed expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. After creation, users can easily move the expense source to a different category if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Tracking and Summary
All transactions related to these expense categories are recorded in the transaction section, which then reflects in the expense section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This provides a clear overview of:
*   The total budgeted amount set for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense that has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

This helps users to [[budgeting_and_savings_strategies | keep track of their budgeted payments]] and maintain control over their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

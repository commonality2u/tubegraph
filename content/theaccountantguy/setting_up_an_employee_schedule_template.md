*   **Monthly View**: Shows months divided into quarters, along with hours worked and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Employee Performance**: Displays specific performance information broken down by individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

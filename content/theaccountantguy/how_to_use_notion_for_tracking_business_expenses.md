This guide provides a walkthrough of a [[managing_business_expenses_using_notion | business expense tracker]] designed to help you [[expense_tracking_using_notion | keep track of your business expenses]] in one centralized location using Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Key Sections of the Tracker

### Expense Categories
The tracker begins with a section for defining different expense categories that your business incurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Predefined heads of business expenses are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

*   **Modifying Categories**: Click on an existing category to modify or change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Editing Subcategories**: To change a subcategory, click the pencil icon and edit the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: Click "new" to add a new category of your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Setting Budgeted Amounts
Once categories are set, you can define a [[budgeting_business_expenses_using_notion | budgeted amount of expense]] for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This amount will be automatically reflected later in the tracker's overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Expenses Overview
The expenses overview provides a summary of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Here you can see:
*   The [[how_to_track_income_and_expenses_using_notion | total expenses]] that have been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   The [[budgeting_business_expenses_using_notion | budget expenses]] that were set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   A percentage indicating whether you have exceeded or stayed within your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Changes to budgeted amounts, such as increasing advertising budget from $100 to $5,000, will automatically update in the expenses overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Recording Transactions
The transaction section is where you enter individual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
*   **Date**: Choose the date of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The chosen date will automatically populate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Description**: Add a description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Account**: Select or add any of your predefined accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Amount**: Input the amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Summary and Reporting
On the left side of the tracker, a summary displays:
*   The [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   The [[how_to_track_income_and_expenses_using_notion | total expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

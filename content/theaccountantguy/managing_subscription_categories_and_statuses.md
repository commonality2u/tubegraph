The subscription expenses tracker allows users to efficiently manage and categorize their subscriptions, as well as track their active and canceled statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

The "subscription overview" section provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Subscriptions are organized into "active" and "cancel" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Underneath each category, users can find:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   The total expenses incurred for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   The billing period for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The billing period can be changed by clicking on it and selecting from available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. While the name of the billing period can also be changed, it is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Managing Subscription Groups and Categories

The "expenses section" further divides subscriptions into different groups or classifications, such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Users can:
*   Add a new group by clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Edit an existing group by clicking on it and changing its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Within each classification, the tracker displays the subscription name, total expenses, and the percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Subscriptions
A "quick action button" allows users to add a new subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. When added, it initially appears under a "note" subscription category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Users can then move it to any desired classification, such as "active mode," by clicking on the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Details of the subscription can be edited using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Tracking and Updating Subscription Transactions

The "transaction section" is where users input details to book subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

It features:
*   An "active subscriptions" view, showing all currently active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   A "cancel substitution" view for canceled subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Subscriptions in this section are bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The total sum of expenses incurred for each particular month is also displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Managing Subscription Status
To manage a subscription's status:
*   A checkbox indicates if a subscription is currently active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   To cancel a subscription, users can simply click the checkbox, which will automatically move it to the "cancel status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This change is reflected in the main overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

For each transaction, users can:
*   Select the subscription account, which pulls from all subscriptions added previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   The billing period is automatically pulled from the value set in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   Choose the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Enter the amount of the subscription expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the set billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. For example, a monthly Netflix subscription paid on September 30th would have a renewal date of October 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

A quick subscription transaction can be created by clicking "space subscription" to add a new entry where details can be inputted and updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

This article outlines how to track personal finances using a Notion-based personal finance tracker, covering income, expenses, debts, savings, bills, subscriptions, net worth, and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The system is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of your financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Overview of the Personal Finance Tracker

The tracker is structured into three main sections:
*   **Net Worth Target:** Allows users to specify their net worth goal for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Account Section:** Where different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities are specified, including opening balances, payment frequencies, and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Summary Section:** Provides an at-a-glance view of all finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Beyond these core sections, the tracker also includes dedicated views for:
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   Budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   Subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Net Worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   Transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>

## Setting Up Income and Expense Accounts

To begin [[adding_and_managing_income_and_expenses | tracking your income and expenses]], navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Here, you'll find pre-defined income (e.g., salary, side hustle) and expense accounts (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Modifying Existing Accounts:** Click the "edit" button next to an account to modify its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Adding New Accounts:** Click the "new" button to set up a new income or expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

When setting up expenses, you can classify them (e.g., "bills," "subscriptions," "debt," "savings") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> and set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly, annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Income and expense accounts typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Recording Income and Expense Transactions

After setting up accounts, head to the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This section has five views: "All" (for all transaction types) and specific categories like "Income," "Expenses," "Asset," and "Liability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

To record an income transaction:
1.  Navigate to the "Income" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
2.  Click "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
3.  Select the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Transactions are bifurcated by month in descending order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
4.  Add a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
5.  The category will automatically be "income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
6.  Select the specific income account (e.g., Salary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
7.  Choose the payment mode (e.g., bank, cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
8.  Select "inflow" as the transaction type, since money is coming into your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
9.  Specify the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

For expenses, the process is identical, but the transaction type will be "outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Tracking Income and Expenses: The Summary View

The "Summary" section, specifically the "Finances" view, allows you to track your income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   It displays all accounts classified under income, expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   You can see the total amount earned for each income source and its percentage contribution to total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Similarly, it shows total expenses and the percentage contribution of each expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Changes made to transaction amounts are quickly reflected in the summary view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Net Worth Overview

The net worth is the difference between your assets and liabilities at the end of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
1.  **Set Net Worth Goal:** In the "Net Worth Goal" section, specify your target net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.
2.  **Track Net Worth:** The "Net Worth" section under "Summary" provides an overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.
    *   It shows the net worth goal and the total current net worth (assets minus liabilities from all recorded transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
    *   The "Difference" indicates how much you are lagging behind your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
    *   A "Percentage" shows the proportion of the net worth goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
    *   "Total Growth" is calculated as the closing net worth minus the opening net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. Opening net worth is derived from the opening balances of assets and liabilities specified in the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>.

## Investment Tracking

The tracker includes an "Investment" tab to track investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.
1.  **Set up Investment Accounts:** In the "Accounts" tab, set up investment accounts (e.g., "Apple investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.
    *   Specify an opening balance (often 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
    *   Classify the investment (e.g., "stocks," "crypto") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
    *   Add opening units if applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
    *   Crucially, set the "Asset Class" to "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
2.  **Record Investment Transactions:** Under the "Asset" section in "Transactions," record investment purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
    *   **Purchases:** Always record the "amount" at the *cost price* of the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
    *   **Sales:** Record the "amount" at the *cost value* of the units being sold, not the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:43:02]</a>. This allows the system to calculate profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.
    *   You can also input the number of units and price per unit to automatically compute the investment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.
3.  **Track Investments in Summary:** The "Investment" tab shows the total amount of investment, number of units, profit or loss, and investment percentage for each holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.

## Tips for Couples

This dashboard is equally applicable for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. In the "Account" section, different categories of accounts can be split per individual (e.g., "Salary by Him," "Side Hustle by Her") to track finances separately within the same system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. This allows for individual tracking of income, expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

## Template Features and FAQs

*   **Viewing Specific Account Transactions:** From the "Finances" summary view, click on any income or expense account (e.g., "Salary") to open a side window that displays only the transactions related to that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. This avoids sifting through all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.
*   **Device Availability:** The template is accessible on all devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and supports iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.
*   **Cost:** Notion is a free tool for personal use, so there are no additional costs beyond the template price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.
*   **Multiple Currencies:** Notion supports many currencies. To change the currency, go to any property with a currency sign (e.g., "Amount"), click "Edit property," go to "Number format," and select the desired currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. This needs to be done for all relevant views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.

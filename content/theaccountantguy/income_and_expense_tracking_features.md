The budgeting tracker template offers various options to fulfill budgeting needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It provides a comprehensive overview of financial components once downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Core Components
The budgeting tracker is built around five distinct financial components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>

For each component, a targeted or budgeted amount can be specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Tracking Progress
The tracker helps in [[tracking_income_and_expenses | tracking income and expenses]] by providing:
*   **Goal/Budgeted Amounts**: Users can set a goal amount for each income component monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> and a budget amount for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Automatic Updates**: As expenses are incurred, the tracker automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Budget Incurred**: A percentage shows how much of the budgeted amount has been used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Budget Status**: A "budget status" indicates whether an expense has exceeded the budgeted amount or remained within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Detailed Overviews
On the left side of the interface, users can access an overview of all elements for each component via a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Income Overview**: Clicking "income overview" displays all added income categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For each category, it shows the specific income amount, the set goal amount, and the total percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Expense Overview**: For expenses, it shows the targeted amount and the actual incurred expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Users can add as many categories as desired for each component, and these will automatically update in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Adding and Managing Transactions
The tracker facilitates [[tracking_and_entering_transactions_in_a_business_expense_tracker | tracking and entering transactions in a business expense tracker]] through quick buttons located in a dedicated section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Inputting Data
*   **Quick Buttons**: Clicking "income" or "expense" buttons automatically adds a new entry to the respective transaction window for the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Transaction Details**: For each entry, users provide details such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:

    *   **Month and Year**: Users can input months for the current or different years, which auto-populates details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   **Category**: A specific category for the income source or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> (e.g., salary, side income, food, entertainment, shopping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

    *   **Budget Amount**: Set at the start of the month for each source/category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **Actual Amount**: The actual income or expense amount incurred during the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Currency Customization
The currency for numerical values can be changed from dollars to any other currency supported by Notion, which offers a default selection of many currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This is done by clicking on number values, then "edit property," and selecting "number format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Monthly Summary and Funds Balance
Below the main components, a detailed month-wise summary is available for each category and element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. For example, expense categories like "food," "entertainment," and "shopping" are broken down by month (e.g., Jan 2024, Feb 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Funds Balance
A "funds balance" view shows the total income, total spendings, and the remaining balance at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This provides a quick glance at the financial position at the end of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Spendings include expenses, debt payments, bills, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Dynamic Filtering
The tracker supports dynamic filtering of data:
*   **Filter by Year**: Users can filter the entire dataset for a particular year, such as 2024, to view all values for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Filter by Month**: Data can also be filtered by a specific month (e.g., "Jan"), potentially across all years, or for a specific month within a specific year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This dynamic filtration is available for all sections, including the funds balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

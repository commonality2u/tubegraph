The [[setting_up_employee_schedule_using_notion | employee schedule template]] in Notion helps organizations keep track of employee schedules and manage tasks effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template is designed to be fully customizable to suit specific organizational needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Key Views

The template provides four distinct views to manage employee scheduling and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>:

*   **Employee Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>: Lists all employees with their relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Task Schedule** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>: Used for entering all tasks for employees across different dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Monthly View** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>: Shows months divided into quarters, displaying hours worked and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Employee Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>: Provides exact performance information categorized by individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Employee Details Management

The [[employee_details_management_in_notion | employee details]] section is the starting point for managing employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Adding Employees

*   To add a new employee, click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Employees can be categorized, for example, under operations, marketing, or finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   New categories can be added using the plus icon, and existing ones can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   When adding a new employee, you will be prompted to enter their name, employee ID, and contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Further details such as department, position, and email ID can also be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   A quick action "Add Employee" button at the top can also be used to automatically add a new employee entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Task Scheduling

After setting up employee details, the "Task Schedule" section is used to manage employee tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Shift and Task Entry

*   Tasks are divided into different shifts, such as first, second, and third shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   For each task, employees can enter a desired start date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   An end time can also be indicated, specifying the period to which the time belongs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Detailed task information can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Employees can be selected from the list added earlier, or new employees can be added directly from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   The respective departments for each employee are automatically displayed based on the [[employee_details_management_in_notion | employee details]] setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Automatic Calculations and Status Tracking

*   The template automatically calculates the hours worked on a specific task based on the entered time information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Employees can mark their attendance status as "present," "on leave," or "day off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Task progress can be tracked with statuses like "in progress," "completed," or "not started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   A "not applicable" status can be used for tasks when an employee has a day off or is on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Performance Tracking

### Monthly View

*   The "Monthly View" organizes data by months, further divided into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   It displays the total hours an employee has worked for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   It also shows the total hours an employee has been on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   A grand total of hours, summing both working and leave hours, provides a quick overview of monthly performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Employee Performance View

*   For individual performance insights, the "Employee Performance" section mirrors the information from the monthly view but presents it broken down by each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   Here, you can see specific hours worked, hours on leave, and total hours for every employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

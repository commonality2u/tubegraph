The charity donation tracker is a Notion-based template designed to help users track their donations to various charities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This dashboard is highly flexible and allows for significant [[customizing_notion_templates_for_financial_tracking | customization]] to fit individual needs.

## Fund Setup Customization

The tracker's "Donation Funds Overview" section includes a "Fund Setup" area, which can be tailored by users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Customizing Donation Categories
Donations are initially divided into default categories such as Health, Environment, and Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Categories**: Users can edit these pre-existing categories by clicking on them and typing in new names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: To add a new category, slide the bottom slider to the right to reveal a plus icon, which allows for the creation of new groups and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Managing Donation Funds
Within each category, specific donation funds (e.g., American Red Cross, Sierra Club) are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Adding New Funds**: A "Add Funds" button allows for the quick addition of new funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These new funds can then be classified under an existing or newly created category by clicking the three dots next to them and moving them to the desired classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Editing Fund Details**: Users can edit the details of any fund by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This includes adding the fund name, setting an opening balance (donations made at the start of the financial year), specifying a targeted donation amount, and defining start and target end dates for donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Deleting Funds**: Existing funds can be deleted by clicking the three dots next to them and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Recent Donations Customization

The "Recent Donations" section tracks all individual donations made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Adding Donations**: A "Add Donation" button automatically adds a new line item with the current date, allowing users to input details like description, period, fund, and donation amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Customizing Periods**: Users can create new donation periods (e.g., March 2024) if a fund is created on a new date not already listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Data Flexibility**: Figures and values in the tracker can be changed by the user to suit their preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Currency Customization

The entire donation tracker dashboard can be configured to display amounts in **any currency of your choice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Notion supports a wide variety of currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. While the transcript states that changing the currency involves a "different setup," it confirms that the currency can be set to any preferred choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. For specific instructions on how to change the currency within the dashboard, users are directed to a separate video tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

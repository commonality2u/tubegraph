This article outlines how to [[budgeting_and_tracking_in_notion | utilize a monthly budget planner in Notion]] for effective financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system helps users budget for each month and track their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Overview of the Monthly Budget Planner

The Notion monthly budget planner features four distinct views at the outset:
*   **Expenses Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Monthly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   **Yearly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Summary of all expenses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

### Expenses Overview

This view displays predefined expense categories, which include shopping, entertainment, food expenses, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. For each category, the following information is presented:
*   Total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Percentage of total budgeted amount incurred as an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Status (indicating whether the budget was exceeded or if it is still under budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

### Monthly Overview

The monthly overview organizes all expenses by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Months are categorized, allowing users to see all expenses for a given month at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Yearly Overview

Similar to the monthly view, the yearly overview presents the same expense information but formatted by year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Summary Section

The summary section provides a complete annual expense overlook, consolidating all expenses to give a comprehensive view of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Using the Expense Details Database

To [[using_notion_for_expense_management | use this Notion budget tracker]], data is entered into the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This database calculates all expenses incurred daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Entering Transactions

Expenses in the database are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, meaning later months appear at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

To enter a new transaction:
1.  Click the "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  Enter the date (e.g., February 1, 2024), which will automatically adjust the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  Input the expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
4.  Select the period (e.g., "Feb 2024"). Users can add new periods if not displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
6.  Choose the category of expense (e.g., utilities). Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
7.  Input an expense code, which helps segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
8.  Enter the expense amount in the "expense amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

It's important to note the distinction between the "expense amount" column (for booking specific expenses) and the "budget amount" column (for setting a budget at the start of the month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Setting a Monthly Budget

At the beginning of each month, users have the option to set a budget for specific expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

To set a budget:
1.  Select the date (e.g., the first day of the month, February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense name for which the budget is being set (e.g., "food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
3.  Select the period (e.g., "February") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
4.  Select the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
5.  Choose the category, ensuring the expense name and category name remain the same for budgeting purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
6.  Set the expense code based on the category and month (e.g., "food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
7.  Input the budgeted amount in the "budget column" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Once the budget is set, all figures in the top views for respective months and categories will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. As more expense information is added, the top section updates, providing progress insights for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Analyzing Budget Data

After booking expenses, users can extract various insights from the different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Period-Based Analysis

Clicking on a specific period (e.g., "Feb 2024") opens a new window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This view displays all transactions booked for that period, detailing the amount and whether it was a budget or an expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Year-Based Analysis

Similarly, clicking on a year provides a view of:
*   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
*   Expenses amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>
*   Expense as a percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
*   Budget status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>
It also lists all transactions for the entire year, including amounts and whether they are expenses or budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Category-Based Analysis

Users can also view data by category, showing:
*   Expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
*   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   Expenses as a percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>
This view also displays all category-related expenses booked so far, with their budgeted and actual expense amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Expense Code Analysis

The expense code allows users to see how much has been booked for a particular category of expense and for a specific month, compared to the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

By regularly booking transactions and utilizing these four different views, users can effectively track their finances and understand their financial progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The dashboard tab in the personal finance tracker spreadsheet is designed to facilitate the [[investment_tracking_and_dashboard_analysis | analysis]] and [[summarizing_and_visualizing_net_worth_data_in_a_dashboard | summarization]] of your income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. It provides a comprehensive overview of your financial activity after you have entered details in the [[navigating_the_budget_tab_for_income_and_expenses | budget tab]] and transactions tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Navigating and Data Flow
Before analyzing data in the dashboard, you must first feed in details in the [[navigating_the_budget_tab_for_income_and_expenses | budget tab]], which involves specifying accounts for income and expenses and setting monthly budgeted amounts or income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. After this, individual transactions are added to the transactions tab, including the date, details, category (linked to accounts from the budget tab), and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Once these steps are complete, the dashboard reflects the aggregated data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides several key components for financial analysis:

*   **Summary Section**
    This section presents an overall summary of income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. It displays the total income, total expense amount, and the net balance between the two for the selected period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

*   **Income Overview**
    This part of the dashboard specifies the different sources of income earned during the filtered period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

*   **Expenses Overview**
    Similar to the income overview, this section breaks down expenses by category for the selected period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

*   **Monthly Personal Finance Overview**
    Positioned on the right side of the dashboard, this overview details income and expenses on a monthly basis, along with the net balance for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

*   **Status Callout**
    A "status callout" indicates whether your expenses have exceeded the budget or not, providing a quick visual cue on your financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Controlling the Analysis View

The entire dashboard display is controlled by three main filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>:
*   **Category**: Allows you to filter data by specific income or expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Period**: Enables selection of a specific timeframe, such as an entire year (e.g., 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Type of Reference**: Determines whether to show all accounts or a specific type (e.g., just income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Filtering Examples
To view a summary of all income and expenses for an entire period, such as 2023, you would filter accordingly to show all accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This will update the dashboard to display the total income, total expenses, and net balance for that timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

For a more granular view, you can filter to see only the total income detail for a specific year, like 2023, across all income accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. You can also narrow down the analysis further by selecting an individual source of income, such as "salary," which will update the entire view to show only the relevant amounts for that specific category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This flexibility allows for detailed [[investment_tracking_and_dashboard_analysis | analysis]] of specific financial flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

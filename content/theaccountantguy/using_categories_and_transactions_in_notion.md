This Notion budgeting tracker template offers various options to fulfill budgeting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It is composed of five key components: income, expense, debt, bills, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Core Components and Tracking
For each component, you can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Income** You can set a goal amount for each income component for every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Expense** You can set a budget amount, which automatically updates as expenses are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   **Percentage Tracking** The tracker shows the percentage of the budgeted amount that has been incurred as an expense, applying similarly across all components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Budget Status** A budget status indicates whether expenses have exceeded the budgeted amount or remained within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

## [[overview_and_transaction_management_in_notion | Overview of Components]]
On the left side of the dashboard, you can get an [[overview_and_transaction_management_in_notion | overview]] of all elements for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   By clicking a dropdown, you can view the five different components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   For an income [[overview_and_transaction_management_in_notion | overview]], it displays all added income [[adding_and_deleting_categories_in_notion | categories]], including specific income amounts, set goal amounts, and the total percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   This [[overview_and_transaction_management_in_notion | overview]] aggregates data across all months you add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   When selecting different components, you'll see targeted amounts and incurred expenses for expense sources, or goal amounts and met income amounts for income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   You can add as many [[adding_and_deleting_categories_in_notion | categories]] as needed for each component, and they will automatically update in the filtered view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## [[detailing_the_transaction_section_in_notion | Transaction Section Input]]
The input section for [[adding_and_editing_transactions_in_notion | transactions]] is located below the main [[overview_and_transaction_management_in_notion | overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### Quick Buttons for [[adding_and_editing_transactions_in_notion | Transactions]]
Quick buttons are available for adding specific types of [[adding_and_editing_transactions_in_notion | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. For example, clicking "income" automatically adds an income entry to the current date, allowing you to fill in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Inputting Details for [[adding_and_editing_transactions_in_notion | Transactions]]
For each [[adding_and_editing_transactions_in_notion | transaction]], you need to add:
*   **Detail** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>
*   **Month and Year** You can select or type in the month and year, and the system will automatically add the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **[[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | Category]]** You select a specific [[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | category]] for the income or expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. For income, examples include "salary," "side income," and "other sources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
    *   You can [[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | edit]] these [[adding_and_deleting_categories_in_notion | categories]] by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **Code** This refers to the source of the income or expense within its [[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | category]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. It helps to collate different elements for specific months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount** At the start of the month, you can set a budget amount for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount** As the month progresses, you enter the actual income or expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

### Monthly Summary
Below the input section, there is a month-wise summary, similar to the top [[overview_and_transaction_management_in_notion | overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   It provides a breakdown for each [[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | category]] and element by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   When new [[adding_and_deleting_categories_in_notion | categories]] or months are added (e.g., "Food" for Feb 2024), they automatically appear in this summary, updating with budget and actual amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   The summary shows the percentage of the budget incurred and whether you are "under budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

#### Customizing Currency
You can change the currency from dollars to any other currency by clicking on number values, selecting "edit property," and then "number format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

### Filtering Data
The data can be dynamically filtered by year or month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   To filter, click the three dots on the slider, add a filter, and select "year" or "month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
*   You can select a specific year to see all values for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
*   Similarly, you can select a specific month to view details across all years or for a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

### Funds Balance
A "funds balance" [[overview_and_transaction_management_in_notion | overview]] is available, showing monthly income, spendings, and the remaining balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   Spendings are derived from expenses, debt payments, bill payments, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
*   Income is from the income source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
*   This section dynamically updates as income and expenses are entered, providing a quick glance at your account balance at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. It can also be filtered by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

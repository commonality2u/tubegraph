[[notion_overview | Notion Books Freelancers OS]] is a comprehensive dashboard designed for freelancers to manage their finances, client interactions, and personal/professional development [00:00:08]. This system includes dedicated sections for resource management and goal setting, providing a centralized location for essential business and personal information [00:03:52].

## Resource Management
The "Resources" section, located under the "Tools" menu, provides a curated collection of useful information [00:28:56]. Resources are categorized to help users quickly find what they need [00:29:07].

### Resource Categories
Resources are organized into four primary categories [00:31:09]:
*   Checklists [00:29:11]
*   Guides [00:29:11]
*   Strategies [00:29:11]
*   Tips [00:29:13]

Within these categories, resources can be further classified by topics such as taxes, [[using_notion_for_budgeting | budgeting]], [[tracking_saving_goals_and_contributions_in_notion | investments]], and [[setting_savings_targets_in_notion | savings]] [00:29:43].

### Adding and Managing Resources
To add a new resource:
1.  Click the "New" button within any resource category [00:29:19].
2.  Provide a name for the resource [00:29:21].
3.  Select an existing category or create a new one [00:29:37].
4.  Add an external link if applicable [00:29:53].

Each resource can be expanded to include additional details and notes [00:30:01]. Users can add notes and even create a [[setting_objectives_and_tasks_in_notion | to-do list]] within a resource by typing a forward slash (/) to access various Notion formatting options [00:30:09]. This allows for detailed documentation, such as outlining documents required for taxes [00:30:53].

## Goal Setting
The "Goal" section, also found under "Tools", allows users to set and track personal and business objectives [00:33:06].

### Goal Categories
Goals are pre-classified into three categories, but users can customize these or add their own [00:33:14]:
*   Health [00:33:16]
*   Wealth [00:33:17]
*   Relationship [00:33:17]

### Adding and Tracking Goals
To add a new goal:
1.  Click the "New" button in the goal section [00:33:23].
2.  Enter the goal [00:33:25].
3.  Specify a target date for achievement [00:33:30].

Each goal can be clicked to reveal additional properties [00:33:41]:
*   **Target:** The numerical value of the goal (e.g., "10" for losing 10 pounds) [00:33:46].
*   **Progress:** The current achievement towards the goal (e.g., "3" for having lost 3 pounds) [00:33:49].

The system automatically calculates the "Completion Percentage" based on the specified target and actual progress, providing a clear visual representation of goal advancement [00:33:34]. This allows users to track any type of goal and see its completion rate [00:34:05].

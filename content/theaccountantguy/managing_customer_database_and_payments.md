The "Customer Payments Tracker" is a simple template designed to help users keep track of all customer payments in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool is customizable to specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Template Layout

The tracker is divided into several key sections:

*   **Overview Section** (right side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   **Transaction Section** (right side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

### Summary Section

The summary section provides a quick glance at financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It displays:

*   The payment amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Customer Section

This section allows for setting up and [[managing_customer_information_in_notion | managing a customer database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Customer Categorization**: Customers can be organized into three default subsections: Regular, Seasonal, and Occasional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These subsections can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> or new ones can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Customer Management**:
    *   Each item within a subsection represents a different customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
    *   Users can edit customer names using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   New customers can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   Customers can be deleted by clicking on a three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Payment Due Tracking**: For each customer, the total payment amount due is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This amount can be easily updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Once the customer database and due amounts are set up, the overview section shows the total payment received, the total payment due, and the percentage of payments received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This section's data is derived from the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

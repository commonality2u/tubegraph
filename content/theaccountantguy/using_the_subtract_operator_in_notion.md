To find the difference between two numbers in Notion, two primary methods can be employed: the `subtract` operator and the minus sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Database Setup

Initially, a database must be created in Notion by typing a forward slash followed by "database" to access the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Within this database:
*   The first property should be a title property, which indicates the purpose of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   [[Adding numbers in Notion | Number properties]] need to be assigned to two different numbers to facilitate finding the difference between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Using the `subtract` operator
The `subtract` operator is a formula specifically used to find the difference between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This operator accepts two numbers as input and then calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For instance, by providing "number one" and "number two" as inputs, the `subtract` operator will yield their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This method is effective for [[subtracting_numbers_in_notion | subtracting numbers in Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Using the Minus Sign
As an alternative, the minus sign (`-`) can also be utilized to find the difference between two numbers within a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This offers another method for [[using_formulas_to_calculate_differences_in_notion | calculating differences]] between numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

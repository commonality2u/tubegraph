### Training Overview

The training overview provides a summary of all scheduled trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each individual training, you can see:
*   **Training Date**: When employees were scheduled to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Employees Count**: The number of employees expected to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Next Training Date**: Users can specify the next training date for an employee, and the system will display the remaining days until that date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

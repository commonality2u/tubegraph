This article explains how to utilize the travel expense tracker to keep track of and plan for travel expenses, focusing on the summary and expense views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The tracker includes a summary section that provides an overview of accounts, expenses, and an overall summary of all expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Expense Classification and Setup

Expenses are initially classified under main categories such as Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Users can add new expense sources (e.g., Metro) to these categories and set a budgeted amount for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, a budgeted amount for "Metro" could be $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This setup forms the basis for [[Classifying and categorizing travel expenses | classifying and categorizing travel expenses]] and subsequent analysis.

## Expense Summary View

After setting up accounts and budgeted amounts, the "Expenses" section provides a detailed view of incurred costs against budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

This view shows:
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Budgeted expense set for that expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   The percentage of what has been spent relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Visual Indicators

The expense summary uses color-coding to provide quick insights:
*   **Red:** Indicates that the incurred expense has exceeded the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. For instance, if $2,000 was incurred for flights against a $1,000 budget, it shows 200% and is highlighted in red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Green:** Indicates that the incurred expense is within the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For example, $100 spent on breakfast against a $300 budget (33%) would appear in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This [[Expense Analysis and Budgeting | classification]] helps in getting a one-glance view of where expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Overall Summary Section

The main "Summary" section provides a complete overview of all travel-related financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

It displays:
*   The total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   The total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The difference between total incurred and total budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   A percentage reflecting the total expenses divided by the budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For example, 3600 (incurred) divided by 6800 (budgeted) reflects 59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

This overall summary allows users to see their progress towards their budgeted expenses and how much they have spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This aligns with [[using_the_summary_section_in_notion_expense_tracker | using the summary section in Notion expense tracker]].

## Booking and Updating Expenses

Expenses can be booked under specific categories (Travel, Meals, Lodging) using quick addition buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. When an expense is added, such as $100 for a train trip to Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, the "Expenses" summary automatically updates to reflect the new incurred amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If a budgeted expense for "Train" was set to $200, the summary would show 50% incurred in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

By utilizing this template, users can quickly understand their current spending against budgets, facilitating better expense planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

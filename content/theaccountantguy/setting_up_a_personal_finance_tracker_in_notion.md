## [[building_a_net_worth_tracker_using_notion | Building a Net Worth Tracker]]

*   **Setting a Net Worth Goal**:
    *   Navigate to the **Net Worth Goal section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
    *   Specify your target net worth to achieve by the end of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.
*   **Viewing Net Worth in Summary**:
    *   Go to the **[[building_a_net_worth_tracker_using_notion | Net Worth section]]** under the **Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
    *   It shows your net worth goal, total net worth (calculated as total assets minus total liabilities), and the difference (how much you are lagging behind) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
    *   It also displays the percentage of the net worth goal achieved and the total growth (closing net worth less opening net worth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.
    *   The opening net worth is derived from the opening balances specified for assets and liabilities in the account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>.

## Tracking Investments

The tracker allows for tracking investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.
*   An "Investment" tab shows total investment amounts, units, and profit/loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
*   **Setting Up Investment Accounts**:
    *   Go to the **Accounts tab** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
    *   Add new investment accounts (e.g., Apple Investment, Bitcoin Investment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
    *   Investments are considered assets, so specify the opening balance and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
    *   Create a classification (e.g., Stocks, Crypto) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.
    *   Crucially, set the **Asset Class** as "Investments" to ensure correct calculations in the Investments tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **Recording Investment Transactions**:
    *   Go to the "Asset" section under "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
    *   For investment **purchases**, record the transaction at the **cost price** in the "Amount" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.
    *   For investment **sales**, record the **cost value of the units being sold** in the "Amount" field, NOT the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. This allows the system to correctly compute profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>.
    *   The "Units" and "Price" fields can be edited for each transaction to reflect the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.

## Managing Finances for Couples

This Notion dashboard is applicable for couples looking to [[managing_finances_with_notion | manage their finances]] together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.
*   Under the **Account section**, couples can split categories of accounts by individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.
*   For example, "Salary by Him" and "Side Hustle by Her" can denote income earned by each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   This approach can be applied to all accounts, including expenses, assets, and liabilities, allowing couples to keep track of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

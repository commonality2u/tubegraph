From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 
The Notion personal finance tracker is designed to help users track various aspects of their finances, including net worth, income, expenses, debts, budgets, savings, bills, and subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is structured into three main sections: Net Worth Target, Account Section, and Summary Section, along with a Transaction Section for data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Core Sections of the Tracker

The tracker is organized into several key areas:
*   **Net Worth Target** Allows setting a financial year-end net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Account Section** Where different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities are specified, including opening balances, payment frequency, and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** Provides an overview of finances at a glance, including detailed views for finances, debt, budget, savings, bills, subscriptions, and net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Transaction Section** The primary area for feeding all income, expense, asset, or liability transactions that affect the overall tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | Tracking Income and Expenses]]

To track income and expenses, begin by navigating to the "Account section" under the "Get Started view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Setting Up Accounts
Here, you can find existing income accounts (e.g., Salary, Side Hustle) and expense accounts (e.g., Groceries, Utility Bills, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Adding/Modifying Accounts:** Click the "edit" button to modify an existing account or the "new" button to add a new income or expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Classification:** For expenses, you can classify them (e.g., "Bills" for groceries, "Subscriptions" for Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency:** Set how frequently an expense is expected to be paid (e.g., monthly for utility bills, annually for subscriptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance:** Income and expense accounts typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Entering Transactions
After setting up accounts, head to the "Transactions view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Views:** The "Transactions view" has an "All view" for all types of transactions (assets, liabilities, income, expenses) and specific category views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## [[setting_up_an_investment_portfolio_tracker_in_notion | Tracking Investments]]

The tracker includes an "investment tab" to monitor investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

### Setting Up Investment Accounts
*   Go to the "Accounts tab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
*   Add new investment accounts (e.g., Apple investment, Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance & Units:** Specify the opening balance and opening units if you held investments at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>.

Enter investment transactions under the "Assets" section in the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.
*   **Purchases:** Record investment purchases at their *cost price* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Sales:** When selling an investment, record the transaction at the *cost value of the units being sold*, not the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. This method is essential for the tracker to accurately compute profit or loss on the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>.
*   The system automatically computes the "investment value" and the profit/loss based on these entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

## Using the Tracker for Couples

This Notion dashboard is applicable for couples looking to track their finances together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.
*   In the "Account section," accounts can be split by individual. For example, "Salary by Him" and "Side Hustle by Her" can differentiate income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   This approach can be applied to all categories (expenses, income, assets, liabilities) to maintain individual tracking within the shared system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

A personal finance tracker in Notion provides a comprehensive system to monitor various aspects of your financial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This setup includes sections for net worth targets, accounts, a summary view, debt management, budgeting, savings, bills, subscriptions, and a detailed transaction log <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Key Sections of the Tracker

The tracker is primarily divided into three main sections:
1.  **Net Worth Target**: Allows you to set a financial year goal for your net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  **Accounts**: Where you specify different accounts under income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, including opening balances, payment frequency, and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
3.  **Summary**: Provides an at-a-glance overview of your entire financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

All transactions—income, expenses, assets, or liabilities—are fed into a dedicated transaction section, which then impacts all other parts of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

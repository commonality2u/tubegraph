This article demonstrates how to utilize a subscription expenses tracker, specifically detailing how to [[how_to_use_a_subscription_expenses_tracker_in_notion | track all your subscription expenses]] and manage transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

The tracker includes a subscription overview section that provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Subscriptions are divided into "Active" and "Cancel" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Underneath each category, you will find:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   The total expenses incurred for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   The billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

The billing period can be changed by selecting from available options, though changing the name of the billing period is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Expenses Section

The expenses section further categorizes subscriptions into groups such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. You can add new groups or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

For each classified subscription, the following details are displayed:
*   Subscription name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

A "quick action" button allows you to add a new subscription, which initially appears under a "not subscribed" category before it can be moved to an appropriate classification like "active" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Transaction Section

This section is dedicated to inputting and [[tracking_transactions_and_balances_for_investments | tracking transactions]] for subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It provides views for both active and canceled subscriptions, bifurcated by month, showing the total sum of expenses incurred for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Recording a New Transaction

To record a subscription transaction:
1.  **Status**: Click the checkbox to indicate the subscription is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
2.  **Subscription Account**: Select the specific subscription account, which is pulled from the subscriptions added in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  **Billing Period**: This value is automatically pulled from the billing period set for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  **Payment Date**: Choose the date the payment was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
5.  **Amount**: Enter the subscription expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the billing period set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, if Netflix was paid on September 30th with a monthly billing period, the next renewal date would be October 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This applies to annual and weekly subscriptions as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Managing Subscription Status

*   **Canceling a Subscription**: Simply click the checkbox to change a subscription's status to "canceled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This change will be reflected in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Quick Add**: A "quick add" button allows for rapidly adding a new subscription entry, which can then be filled with details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Additional Features

*   **Currency Customization**: The tracker allows you to change the currency displayed in the dashboard as per your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

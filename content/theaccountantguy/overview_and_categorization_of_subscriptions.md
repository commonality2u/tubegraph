Sanat Biswal, also known as "The Accountant Guy," demonstrates how to utilize a subscription expenses tracker to manage and track all subscription-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This tool helps in categorizing and monitoring expenditures effectively.

### Subscription Overview Section

The tracker features a **Subscription Overview** section that provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

#### Categories View
Subscriptions are divided into two main categories:
*   **Active Subscriptions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Canceled Subscriptions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

Underneath each category, you will find:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   The total expenses incurred for that subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   The billing period (e.g., monthly, annually, weekly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The billing period can be changed by clicking on it and selecting from available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Expenses Section

The **Expenses** section further categorizes subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Default categories include "Infotainment," "Education," and "Music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

#### Customizing Categories
Users can add new groups by clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> or edit existing group names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

For each classification, the tracker displays:
*   The subscription name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   The percentage of each subscription's cost relative to the total subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

#### Quick Actions
A "Quick Action" button allows users to [[adding_and_modifying_subscription_entries | add a subscription]] quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Newly added subscriptions initially appear under a "not subscribed" category and can be moved to an appropriate classification, such as "Active" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Details of the subscription can be edited using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Transaction Section

The **Transaction** section is where detailed subscription payment information is input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

#### Views within Transactions
*   **Active Subscriptions View**: Shows all currently active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Cancel Subscription View**: Displays canceled subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This view also bifurcates subscriptions by month, showing the latest month at the top and the total sum of expenses for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

#### Entering Transaction Details
To enter a transaction, users can:
*   Mark the subscription status as active by checking a box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   Select the subscription account from a list populated by previously added subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   The billing period is automatically pulled from the top-level settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   Enter the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   Input the amount of the subscription expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the payment date and billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, a Netflix subscription paid on September 30 with a monthly billing period will have a renewal date of October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This applies to various billing periods, including annual and weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

#### Canceling Subscriptions
To cancel a subscription, simply click the checkbox, which moves it to the "cancel status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This change is reflected in the overview section at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

#### Quick Subscription Addition
A "Quick Subscription" button is also available in this section to [[adding_and_modifying_subscription_entries | add a subscription]] that can then be filled with details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Customization and Support

Notion Books Freelancers OS is a dashboard designed for freelancers to track their income, expenses, and overall finances, along with client management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Dashboard Navigation
The dashboard features two main navigation windows:
*   **Finance Section** For managing income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Client Section** For client management, invoicing, project tracking, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

You can navigate between these sections using the navigation bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Finance Section Overview
The Finance section allows you to manage all financial details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Quick instructions are available on the main page for changing currency via a video demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. A separate tutorial video explains how to use the finance setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Key Considerations for Finance Tracking
*   Any income related to a client should be classified as "Client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

*   All income transactions classified under "Client" will reflect in the Client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Service Management
Services are activities performed as part of a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Services are categorized by status: "Not Started", "In Progress", and "Completed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

The total invoice amount is displayed at the top of the invoicing section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. You can also view the number of invoices per category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

### Adding a New Invoice
1.  Click "New" under the desired invoice status category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.
2.  Enter the invoice number (e.g., Invoice 003) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
3.  Set the due date for the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

### Linking Invoices to Workflow
Invoices are linked to the income details in the "Workflow" section, which pulls data from the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
1.  In the "Workflow" table, click on the "Invoice" column for an income entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
2.  Select the newly created invoice (e.g., Invoice 003) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. This automatically updates the invoice amount in the invoicing section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
3.  You can also create new invoices, clients, projects, or services directly from the workflow section, which will automatically populate the respective sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
4.  Specify the client and project associated with the income in the workflow section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
5.  Set the "Payment Mode" (e.g., "Bank") in the workflow section once an invoice is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. If no payment is received, the payment mode can be left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. This impacts banking calculations in the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

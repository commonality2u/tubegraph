Anath Biswal, also known as "the accountant guy," demonstrates how to utilize a travel expense tracker in Notion to keep track of travel expenses and plan ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This system allows for effective [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeting and tracking expenses in Notion]], similar to [[creating_an_expense_tracker_with_notion | creating an expense tracker with Notion]] or [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_using_notion | setting up a personal finance tracker using Notion]].

## Tracker Overview

The travel expense tracker template is structured with a summary section that includes views for accounts, expenses, and an overall summary of all expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This setup is useful for [[expense_tracking_using_notion | expense tracking using Notion]] and [[using_notion_for_expense_management | using Notion for expense management]].

### 1. Accounts View: Setting Up Expense Categories and Budgets

The "Accounts" view is where you define and categorize your expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Expenses are typically classified under broad categories such as "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

#### Adding and Customizing Expense Sources
*   **Adding a New Expense Source**: To quickly add a new expense source, click on "Add Expense Source" within a category (e.g., "Travel"). This automatically adds a new source which can then be modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Editing Expense Source Details**: Click on the pencil icon next to an expense source to edit its name (e.g., "Metro") and set a budgeted amount (e.g., $1,500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Moving Expense Sources**: An expense source can be moved to a different category by clicking the three dots next to it and placing it under another section, such as "Meals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: If you need a new top-level category beyond "Travel," "Meals," or "Lodging," click the plus sign on the right to create a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Categories**: To edit an existing category group, click on it and start editing the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Each expense source has a budgeted amount set, which helps in [[customizing_a_business_expense_tracker_in_notion | customizing a business expense tracker in Notion]] or a personal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### 2. Expenses Summary View: Tracking Progress

The "Expenses" view provides a detailed breakdown for each expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It displays:
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Budgeted expense set for that item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   Percentage of what has been spent relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

![[Travel Expense Tracker Notion View]]
*   **Color Coding**: This view uses a color-coding system:
    *   **Red**: Indicates that the incurred expense has exceeded the budgeted amount (e.g., Flight: $2,000 spent vs. $1,000 budgeted, showing 200% spent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   **Green**: Indicates that the incurred expense is within the budgeted amount (e.g., Breakfast: $100 spent vs. $300 budgeted, showing 33% spent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This view provides a quick glance at where your expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### 3. Overall Summary Section

The summary section offers a complete overview of your travel finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. It shows:
*   Total budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   An overall percentage reflecting total expenses divided by budgeted expenses (e.g., 59% spent of the total budgeted amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Booking Travel Expenses

The expense booking section is also classified under "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging," mirroring the categories in the Accounts view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Steps to Book an Expense
1.  **Use Quick Addition Buttons**: Click on specific buttons like "Add Travel Expense," "Add Meal Expense," or "Add Lodging Expense" to quickly add a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This automatically sets the current date for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  **Enter Details**:
    *   **Description**: Add a brief description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   **Trip Info**: Specify the trip (e.g., "Trip to Paris"). This field can be edited by clicking the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Account**: Select the specific expense source from the pre-defined accounts (e.g., "Train" for a travel expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This is crucial for [[tracking_restaurant_expenses_with_notion | tracking restaurant expenses with Notion]] or other specific categories.
    *   **Amount**: Enter the amount of the expense (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
3.  **Impact on Summary**: Once an expense is booked, it immediately updates the "Expenses" summary, showing the incurred amount against the budgeted amount for that specific expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If a budgeted expense hasn't been set, it will reflect the ideal value once set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

By utilizing this template, you can effectively monitor your expenses and make informed decisions for future financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

This guide details how to utilize a [[using_notion_expense_tracker_for_personal_or_business_expenses | Notion expense tracker]] specifically designed for travel, allowing users to keep track of travel expenses and plan ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The template is structured with a summary section, an accounts view for setting up expense sources, and an expenses section for tracking actual spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This approach makes it easier for [[tracking_personal_finances_using_notion | tracking personal finances using Notion]] or for business travel.

## Summary Section Overview

The summary section provides a concise overview, including:
*   **Accounts**: Where expense sources are defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: Details on individual expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Overall Summary**: A total overview of all incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts (Expense Sources)

The first step in [[creating_a_budget_tracker_with_notion | creating a budget tracker with Notion]] for travel is to set up different expense sources under the accounts view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Expenses are typically classified under broad categories such as Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Sources

To quickly add a new expense source:
1.  Click on the "Add expense source" button within an existing category (e.g., Travel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  A new source will automatically be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
3.  Click the pencil icon next to the new source to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
4.  Rename the expense source (e.g., "Metro") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
5.  Set a budgeted amount for this specific expense (e.g., $1,500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Moving and Deleting Expense Sources

*   **Moving**: To move an expense source to a different category (e.g., from Travel to Meals), click on the three dots next to the source and drag it to the desired section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Deleting**: To delete an expense source, click the three dots next to it and select the delete option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Adding New Categories (Groups)

If you need a completely new top-level category (not nested under Travel, Meals, or Lodging):
1.  Click the "plus" sign on the right side of the accounts view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  This will prompt you to create a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
To edit an existing group, click on the group name and start editing the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Understanding the Expenses Summary

Once accounts are set up with budgeted amounts, the expenses summary provides a quick view of your spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. For each expense source, it shows:
*   **Total Incurred Expense**: The actual amount spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Budgeted Expense**: The amount you planned to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Budget Spent**: The incurred expense as a percentage of the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Visual Cues for Budget Adherence

The tracker uses color-coding to indicate budget status:
*   **Red**: Indicates that the incurred expense has exceeded the budgeted amount (e.g., Flight at 200% of budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Green**: Indicates that the incurred expense is within the budgeted amount (e.g., Breakfast at 33% of budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

This visual feedback offers a one-glance view of where your expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Overall Summary

The overall summary section provides a complete picture of your travel budget:
*   **Total Budgeted Expense**: Sum of all budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Total Incurred Expense**: Sum of all actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The variance between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Overall Percentage**: Total expenses divided by total budgeted expense (e.g., 59%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

This overall percentage helps you understand how close you are to your total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Booking Travel Expenses

To book or record an expense in this [[how_to_build_an_expense_tracker_in_notion | Notion expense tracker]]:
1.  Navigate to the relevant category (Travel, Meals, or Lodging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
2.  Click the corresponding "Add expense" button (e.g., "Add travel expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
3.  A new expense entry will appear with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
4.  Fill in the details:
    *   **Description**: A brief note about the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Trip Info**: Categorize by trip (e.g., "Trip to Paris"). You can edit existing trip names by clicking the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   **Account of Expense**: Select the specific expense source from the dropdown (e.g., "Train" for a travel expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: Enter the monetary value of the expense (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it will instantly reflect in the expenses summary, showing the incurred amount and updating the budget percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If a budgeted expense was not set for that source, it will update once a budget is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

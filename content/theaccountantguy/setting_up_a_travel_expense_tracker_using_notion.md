This article details how to set up and utilize a travel expense tracker within Notion, enabling users to monitor and plan for all travel-related expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system helps keep track of expenses and aids in future planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

This [[tracking_expenses_and_income_in_notion | Notion expense tracker]] is structured into three main sections: Summary, Expenses, and Overall Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Summary Section: Accounts View

The "Accounts" view is where you initially set up and classify your anticipated expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Expenses are categorized under headings like Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

#### Adding and Editing Expense Sources
*   **Adding a new expense source**: Click the "Add Expense Source" button to automatically add a new entry under the currently selected travel category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Editing expense source details**: Click the pencil icon next to an expense source to edit its name (e.g., "Metro") and set a budgeted amount (e.g., $1,500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Moving an expense source**: Use the three-dot menu to move an expense source to a different category, such as moving a "Metro" expense to the "Meals" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Adding a new expense category (group)**: Click the plus sign on the right to create an entirely new expense group separate from the existing Travel, Meals, and Lodging categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Editing an existing category (group)**: Click on an existing group (e.g., Travel, Meals, Lodging) to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Each expense source should have a budgeted amount set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Summary Section: Expenses View

Once accounts are set up, the "Expenses" view provides an overview of actual spending against budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. It shows the total incurred expense, the budgeted expense, and the percentage spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Over-budget indication**: If the incurred expense exceeds the budgeted amount, the percentage will be highlighted in red (e.g., Flight: $2,000 spent on a $1,000 budget shows 200% spent in red) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Within-budget indication**: If spending is within budget, the figure will be shown in green (e.g., Breakfast: $100 spent on a $300 budget shows 33% spent in green) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This view offers a quick glance at where expenses stand for different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Summary Section: Overall Summary

This section provides a complete overview of all budgeted expenses, total incurred expenses, and the difference between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. It also displays the total percentage of expenses incurred relative to the overall budget (e.g., $3,600 total expense divided by $6,800 budgeted results in 59%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Booking Expenses

To book new expenses, the tracker uses categories like Travel, Meals, and Lodging, similar to the "Accounts" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

#### Adding an Expense
1.  **Use quick addition buttons**: Click on specific buttons like "Add Travel Expense," "Add Meals Expense," or "Add Lodging Expense" to quickly add a new expense entry within that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
2.  **Date auto-fill**: The new expense entry will automatically populate with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
3.  **Add details**: Fill in the `Description`, `Trip Info` (e.g., "Trip to Paris"), `Account` (e.g., "Train"), and the `Amount` (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it immediately reflects in the "Expenses" summary. For example, a $100 train expense will appear under the "Train" account in the expenses summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. If a budgeted expense for that account (e.g., $200 for "Train") is set, the system will reflect the percentage spent (e.g., 50% in green for the $100 train expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

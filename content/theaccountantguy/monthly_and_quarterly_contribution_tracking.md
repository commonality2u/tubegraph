This article details how to utilize a template to track contributions for emergency funds, focusing on monthly input and quarterly summaries. It is part of a larger [[personal_finance_tracker | Personal Finance Tracker]] system. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>

The template features a summary section, a savings overview, and a detailed summary of savings and required contributions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>

## Fund Setup

Before tracking contributions, funds must be set up. The template predefines three categories: Financial Safety, Asset Protection, and Health and Wellness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> These categories can be edited or new ones added. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

To add a new fund:
*   Click "add fund." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   The new fund appears under "no classification" and can be moved to a relevant category, like "Financial Safety." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   Click the pencil icon to edit fund details, including:
    *   **Fund Detail:** A description of the fund. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
    *   **Starting Balance:** The initial amount for the fund. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
    *   **Goal Amount:** The targeted savings for the fund. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
    *   **Start Date:** When contributions for the fund begin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> This automatically calculates savings made to date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
    *   **Target End Date:** The desired completion date for the fund's goal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>

## Monthly Contribution Tracking

Once funds are set up, contributions can be entered in the dedicated "contribution" section. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> This section organizes contributions by month, with the latest month appearing at the top. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>

For each contribution, the following details are recorded:
*   **Date:** The specific date of the contribution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   **Description:** Any relevant notes for the contribution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   **Period:** The month and year the contribution covers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> New months can be added if not already listed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
*   **Fund:** The specific emergency fund to which the contribution is being made. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> All funds set up previously are available for selection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   **Amount:** The amount of savings or contribution made. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   **Requirement:** This column automatically calculates the required monthly contribution to meet the fund's target by its end date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> A tick mark appears if the entered amount meets or exceeds the requirement for that month. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

The "quick action" button simplifies adding new line items, automatically populating the current month and date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

## Quarterly Financial Summaries

The [[quarterly_financial_summaries | quarterly overview]] provides a glance view of contributions across different quarters. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> Months are grouped into quarters (e.g., January-March for Quarter 1). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>

For each month within a quarter, it shows:
*   Total savings made. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
*   The required savings for that period. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   The percentage of the total target met, displayed with different colors for quick assessment of financial progress. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>

At the top of the [[summary_and_quarterly_payment_overview | quarterly payment overview]], the total savings for each quarter are summed and displayed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>

## Savings Overview

The "savings overview" section categorizes all emergency funds and displays various metrics for each:
*   **Total Savings:** The cumulative savings for each fund (starting balance + contributions). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
*   **Targeted Savings:** The goal amount set for each fund. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>
*   **Achieved Percentage:** The percentage of the targeted savings that has been reached. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
*   **Targeted Savings Date:** The end date set for the fund. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>
*   **Months Left:** The number of months remaining until the targeted end date, calculated from the current date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> This updates automatically. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   **Contribution Required Per Month:** The monthly amount still needed to reach the fund's goal by the target end date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>

## Overall Summary

The "summary section" provides an overarching view of all emergency funds:
*   **Total Savings:** The sum of all opening balances and total contributions across all funds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
*   **Savings Required:** The total of all targeted savings amounts across all funds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>
*   **Difference:** The variance between total savings and total required savings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>
*   **Percentage:** The overall percentage of total targeted savings that has been achieved. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>

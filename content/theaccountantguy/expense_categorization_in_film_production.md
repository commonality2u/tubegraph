Effective [[film_production_budget_tracking | film production budget tracking]] is crucial for managing finances within a film project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. A dedicated budget tracker can help keep track of all expenses related to film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Using a Film Production Budget Tracker

A typical template for [[film_production_budget_tracking | film production budget tracking]] includes a table that lists individual expenses with their respective categories and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Expense and Category Management
*   **Expense Listing:** The table itemizes each expense, showing its amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Category Reflection:** Each expense is associated with a specific category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Customizing Categories:** Users can [[setting_up_expense_categories | define their own categories]] by clicking an edit icon, and these updates will reflect throughout the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. New categories can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, existing ones edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, or deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses
The tracker allows users to update budgeted expense values directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Once these values, along with actual expense amounts, are entered, all figures are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Summary Section
A summary section provides an overview of the financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This includes:
*   The budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and actual amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The percentage of actual expenses relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
This summary provides a concise overview of total expenses and how they compare to the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

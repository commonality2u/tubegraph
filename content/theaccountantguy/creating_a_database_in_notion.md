To find the difference between two numbers in Notion, the first step is to [[creating_database_in_notion | create a database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Steps to create a database

1.  **Initiate Database Creation**: Start by typing a forward slash `/` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  **Select Database Option**: Type `database` to reveal a list of options, from which you can choose to [[creating_database_in_notion | create your database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
3.  **Define Properties**:
    *   **Title Property**: The initial property is typically a "title" property, which helps describe the purpose or context of the data being entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   **Number Properties**: To perform calculations like finding the difference between two numbers, you must assign "number" properties to at least two distinct columns within the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Finding the difference between numbers in a database

Once a database is established and number properties are assigned, you can find the difference between two numbers using formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Using the Subtract Operator

One method involves using the `subtract` operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, if you provide "number one" and "number two" as inputs, the subtract operator will yield their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Using the Minus Sign

Alternatively, you can use the simple minus sign (`-`) within a formula to find the difference between two numbers in your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This method is similar in function to the subtract operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

This guide explains how to [[creating_a_database_in_notion | create a database in Notion]] and use formulas to find the difference between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Two methods are covered: using the subtract operator and using the minus sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Database

To begin, you will need to [[how_to_create_a_database_in_notion | create a database]] in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

1.  Use a forward slash (`/`) and type `database` to bring up the list of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
2.  The first property in your [[creating_a_database_in_notion | database]] will be the title property, which indicates the purpose of the entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
3.  Assign number properties to two different numbers within the [[creating_and_using_databases_in_notion | database]] to enable finding the difference between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Finding the Difference Between Numbers

Once your [[setting_up_databases_and_relationships_in_notion | database is set up]], you can apply formulas to calculate the difference.

### Using the Subtract Operator

One method to find the difference is by using the subtract operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. For example, if you provide "number one" and "number two" as inputs, the formula will return their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Using the Minus Sign

Alternatively, you can use a simple minus sign to find the difference between two numbers in your [[setting_up_a_database_for_adding_numbers_in_notion | database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

These methods demonstrate how to effectively find the difference between two numbers within a [[using_databases_in_notion_for_invoice_tracking | Notion database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The [[using_pdf_output_interface_for_exporting_documents | PDF Output interface]] facilitates the [[bulk_pdf_document_export_process | bulk export of PDF documents]], allowing users to generate multiple PDFs at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17">[03:17]</a>. This contrasts with the single PDF mode, where details are filled in one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17">[03:17]</a>.

## How the Process Works

The [[bulk_pdf_document_export_process | bulk PDF document export process]] involves filling in a database with the necessary information for all documents to be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[03:22]</a>.

### Database Input
Users are presented with a database interface where they can input details for each PDF document, such as invoice numbers and dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47">[03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00">[04:00]</a>. Columns in this database can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07">[04:07]</a>.

### Generation and Download
Once all required information is entered into the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13">[04:13]</a>, users can click "download all PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>. The system then generates the PDF documents one by one based on the filled data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26">[04:26]</a>. For example, three PDF documents can be generated simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>.

### Customization and Output
The generated bulk PDF documents maintain the same format as single PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34">[04:34]</a>. Users can select their preferred currency before generation, and the bulk output will reflect this choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38">[04:38]</a>.

## Current and Future Capabilities

Currently, the feature supports a "live database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45">[04:45]</a>. Future enhancements include integration with Notion databases, allowing users to add details to their Notion database and then [[exporting_bulk_pdf_documents_from_a_database | export documents]] from the PDF Output tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47">[04:47]</a>.

In addition to the "download all PDF" option for [[exporting_bulk_pdfs_with_pdf_output_tool | exporting bulk PDFs]], it is also possible to [[exporting_bulk_pdf_documents_from_a_database | export a PDF document]] for a particular row by clicking the "download PDF" option for that individual entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>.

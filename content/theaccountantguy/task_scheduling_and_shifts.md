An employee schedule template can be utilized to keep track of the schedules of employees within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template typically includes several key views to manage and monitor employee activities.

## Template Views
The employee schedule template often features four distinct views:
*   **[[employee_details_management | Employee Details]]**: Lists information about all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Task Schedule**: Helps in entering tasks for employees on different dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Monthly View**: Shows monthly data, divided into quarters, including hours worked and hours on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **[[tracking_employee_performance_and_attendance | Employee Performance]]**: Displays specific information broken down by individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Task Schedule Management
The task schedule section is central to managing employee work.

### Shifts
Tasks are typically organized into different shifts, such as first, second, and third shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. For each shift, employees can enter details:
*   **Start Time and End Time**: Specify the desired date and time for a task, indicating the period it belongs to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Task Detail**: Employees can add specific [[task_management_within_business_stages | task-related information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Employee Assignment**: The employee's name can be selected, and their respective department, set in the [[employee_details_management | employee details]] section, will automatically appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Employees can also be added directly from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Hours Worked**: The hours an employee has worked on a specific task are automatically computed based on the entered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Attendance and Task Status
Employees can update their attendance and the status of their tasks:
*   **[[recording_and_tracking_attendance_in_training_sessions | Attendance]]**: Employees can mark if they are present, on leave, or have a day off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Task Status**: The status of a task can be updated to "in progress," "completed," or "not started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. In cases where an employee is on leave or has a day off, the task status can be marked as "not applicable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Performance Overview
The template provides views to monitor employee performance based on the scheduled tasks and attendance.

### Monthly View
The monthly view offers an overview of performance, displaying:
*   Total hours worked for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   Total hours an employee has been on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   Total hours, which is the summation of working hours and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
This view provides a quick summary of monthly performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### [[tracking_employee_performance_and_attendance | Employee Performance]] Section
For a detailed look at individual employee performance, the [[tracking_employee_performance_and_attendance | Employee Performance]] section shows the same information as the monthly view, but broken down by each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This includes hours worked, hours on leave, and total hours for every employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

This [[using_notion_for_employee_scheduling | Notion]] template is customizable to fit specific organizational needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

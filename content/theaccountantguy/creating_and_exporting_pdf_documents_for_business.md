## Product Order Tracking with a Notion Template

A simple template called "Products Aut Tracker" can help businesses keep track of customer orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template includes a database with key information for each order:

*   **Product Details**
    *   Product name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Customer Information**
    *   Customer name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
    *   Billing address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
    *   Customer phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
    *   Customer email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Payment and Order Details**
    *   Payment sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
    *   Indication if the product is a gift item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
    *   Amount for the particular order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

### Order Summary and Analytics

The template also provides an order summary at the top, showing:

*   Total order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Number of orders placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   Number of customers who placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   Percentage of products ordered as gift items (e.g., 67%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This percentage dynamically changes based on entered values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Breakdown of payment sources (debit card, PayPal, credit card, other), reflecting the number of customers and their respective percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Customization and Support

This template is entirely customizable to meet specific business needs, allowing for the addition of average order value and other necessary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The database can be expanded to include more items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. For assistance with tracking additional details, users can contact notionformyuse@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

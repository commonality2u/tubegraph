PDF Output is a tool designed to help users [[bulk_pdf_document_generation | generate PDF documents in bulk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It achieves this by using a Google Document as a template and a Notion database to supply the elements that will replace placeholders in the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## How to Export PDF Documents

The general process for [[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents_in_bulk | generating and downloading PDF documents in bulk]] involves three main steps:
1.  Log in to PDF output.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  Add a Google Document to serve as the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
3.  Add a Notion database that holds the data for replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
4.  Click "Export PDF" to initiate the document generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Export Process

1.  **Connecting the Google Document Template**:
    *   Users can either create a new blank Google Document from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> or choose an existing document from Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   Once connected, the document can be renamed, such as "Invitation Template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
    *   Within the Google Document, placeholders (e.g., `salutation`, `customer name`) are defined to be replaced by data from the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
    *   Pre-made templates are also available, which users can copy to their Google Workspace or paste into a blank document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

2.  **Connecting the Notion Database**:
    *   The user connects their Notion account and selects the specific Notion database that contains the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   New databases can be created directly within Notion, like "invitation list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   If new columns (properties) are added to the Notion database, the user can click "refresh properties" in PDF Output to fetch the updated columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   Values from the Notion database properties (e.g., "salutation," "customer name") are copied and pasted into the corresponding placeholders in the Google Document template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   If the database has connections to other databases, all connected databases should be chosen during the approval process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

3.  **Initiating Export and Downloading**:
    *   After setting up the template and database, click the "Export PDF" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   A Google authentication process will be initiated, which needs to be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Once authenticated, the system will read each row of data from the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   For each row, a unique PDF document is generated by replacing the placeholders in the Google Document template with the corresponding data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   The generated PDFs are automatically downloaded to the user's downloads folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For example, if there are three entries in the Notion database, three separate PDF documents will be generated and downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

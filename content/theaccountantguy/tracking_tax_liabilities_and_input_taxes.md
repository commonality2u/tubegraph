A template can be utilized to [[tracking_income_expenses_assets_and_liabilities | track]] all tax payments and liabilities in one glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

The top section of the template provides a tax payment summary, displaying three key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Accounts
This section allows users to set up all revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources**: These are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples include services and goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources**: These are used for availing input tax credit to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example is purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

New revenue or expense sources can be added using a quick action button, which automatically adds a new account line item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The number of revenue and expense sources updates automatically as they are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Financial Sections
This part allows users to [[tracking_income_and_expenses | track]] revenue and expense amounts, along with their respective tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For instance, services might have a total revenue of $2,000 with a total tax payable of $200 (10% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Similarly, purchases can show input taxes, for example, $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] Data Flow
> All details fed into the [[using_transaction_sections_for_tax_records | transactions]] view at the bottom of the template automatically update the financial summary at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes
This section reflects all tax payments due for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. For each quarter, it shows:
*   Taxes Payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Input Tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Tax Liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

Figures are updated based on [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]] entered, for example, if all [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]] relate to quarter three, only quarter three's figures will update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Transaction Section

After setting up revenue and expense accounts, users can move to the [[using_transaction_sections_for_tax_records | transaction section]] at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | Transactions]] are classified into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Adding Revenue Transactions
To add a revenue [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | transaction]], click the "Add Revenue" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This automatically adds a new line item, picking the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Users can then:
1.  Select the period (e.g., Quarter Three for September) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
2.  Select the account (e.g., Goods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  Feed in the amount (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
4.  Input a tax rate (e.g., 8%), which automatically calculates the tax payable (e.g., $80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Once entered, the quarterly taxes summary at the top updates to reflect the new tax payable and overall tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions
Adding an expense [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | transaction]] follows a similar process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
1.  Click "Add Expense", which adds a new line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  Fill in details like the quarter (e.g., Quarter Three) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
3.  Select the account (e.g., Purchases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount (e.g., $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Set the tax rate (e.g., 10%), which calculates the input credit (e.g., $50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

The total input credit and tax liability figures in the summary section at the top will then update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Profit & Loss Section

The template includes a [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss | profit and loss]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This section displays:
*   Total revenue earned from all [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   Total expenses booked so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   The total [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss | profit]] made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

PDFoutput.com offers a solution for [[creating_and_exporting_pdf_documents_for_business | creating PDF documents for a business]] [03:09]. This platform allows users to generate various PDF documents, including invoices, either individually or in bulk from a database [03:22, 04:40].

## Generating Individual PDF Documents

Users can select a template, such as an invoice, and choose a currency (e.g., USD) [03:23, 03:26, 03:30]. After filling in the required details, clicking "[[exporting_and_downloading_pdf_documents | download PDF]]" generates a PDF document based on the entered information [03:36, 04:12]. The currency can be changed, and a new PDF downloaded reflecting the updated currency [04:27, 04:32].

## Bulk PDF Export Mode

For [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents_in_bulk | exporting PDF documents in bulk mode]], PDFoutput.com provides a specific feature [04:40].

### How to Use Bulk Export

1.  **Access Bulk Export Mode**: Click on the "bulk export mode" option [04:44].
2.  **Fill Database**: Populate the provided database with the necessary details for each PDF document, such as invoice numbers, dates, and other fields that correspond to the single PDF mode [04:46, 05:09, 05:23, 05:26, 05:35]. Columns can be expanded for better visibility [05:28].
3.  **[[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents_in_bulk | Generate Bulk PDFs]]**: Once the database is filled, click "download all PDF" to start [[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents_in_bulk | generating PDF documents one by one]] based on the entered information [04:51, 05:45, 05:47].

### Output and Features

The [[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents_in_bulk | generated PDF documents]] maintain the same format as those created in single PDF mode [05:51, 05:57]. If the currency is changed before [[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents_in_bulk | bulk generation]], the PDFs will automatically reflect the new currency [06:03, 06:04].

In addition to bulk export, users can also [[exporting_and_downloading_generated_pdf_documents | download PDF documents]] for individual rows within the database [06:22, 06:25].

### Future Developments

Currently, the platform supports a live database feature [06:08]. A future update will include a Notion database feature, allowing users to add details to their Notion database and then export documents from PDFoutput.com [06:10, 06:12, 06:16].

Users can request new templates or provide feedback on the platform via dedicated links [06:38, 06:43].

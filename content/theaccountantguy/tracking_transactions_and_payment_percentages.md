The Customer Payments Tracker is a simple template designed to [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | keep track of all customer payments]] in one location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool is customizable to specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Tracker Sections

The tracker is divided into a summary section on the left and three distinct sections on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Summary Section

The [[using_a_summary_section_to_track_payment_totals | summary section]] displays key payment metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:
*   Total amount of payment due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   Payment amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   The difference between due and received amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   The percentage of total payments received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

### Right-Side Sections

The right side of the tracker consists of three main sections: Customer, Overview, and Transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

#### Customer Section

This section allows users to set up and manage their entire customer database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It is subdivided into three categories for [[understanding_transaction_classifications_and_payment_frequencies | customer classification]]:
*   Regular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Seasonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Occasional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

Users can edit existing sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, add further subsections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, and manage individual customer entries. Each customer entry shows the total payment amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Editing Customer Details**: Click on an amount to change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, or use the pencil icon to edit customer names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Adding/Deleting Customers**: New customers can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, and existing ones can be deleted via a three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

#### Overview Section

Once the customer database and due payment amounts are set up, the overview section provides a summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It displays:
*   Total payment received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Total payment amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   The percentage of payment received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

This data is derived directly from the Transaction Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

#### Transaction Section

The transaction section is where individual payment transactions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. For each transaction, users can enter:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   Customer name (selected from a list) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   A document section to attach specific invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

Filling in these details automatically updates the payment received amounts across the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For instance, changing a transaction value will immediately reflect in the payment received totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

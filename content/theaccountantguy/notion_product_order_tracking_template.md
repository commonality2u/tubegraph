The [[purchase_order_tracker_template_in_notion|Products Order Tracker]] is a straightforward Notion template designed to help businesses keep track of all customer product orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Key Information Tracked

The template utilizes a database to store comprehensive order and customer details:
*   **Product Details**
    *   Product Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Customer Information**
    *   Customer Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
    *   Billing Address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
    *   Customer Phone Number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
    *   Customer Email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Order Specifics**
    *   Payment Sources: Specifies how the customer intends to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
    *   Gift Item Indicator: Notes if the product is intended as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
    *   Order Amount: The total value of the customer's order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Order Summary and Analytics

At the top of the template, an order summary section provides a quick overview:
*   **Total Order Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Number of Orders Placed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Number of Customers** who have placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   **Gift Recommendation Percentage**: Indicates the percentage of customers ordering items as gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This percentage dynamically updates with changes in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The template also breaks down [[invoicing_and_payment_tracking_through_notion|payment tracking]] by source, showing how many customers are paying via:
*   Debit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

*   Other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

Each payment source reflects the number of customers and their respective percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Customization and Expansion

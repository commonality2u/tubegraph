Notion Books Freelancers OS is a comprehensive Notion dashboard designed for freelancers to [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | track their income]], [[expense_tracking_in_notion | expense details]], and overall finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It also includes features for client management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Dashboard Overview

Upon downloading the setup, users land on a dashboard featuring quick instructions. These instructions include a video demonstration on how to change the currency within the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, and a tutorial on using the finance setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The dashboard has two main navigation windows:
1.  **Finance Section**: For managing financial details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  **Client Section**: For client management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Finance Section

The finance section is crucial for [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | managing personal finances]] and tracking income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. A tutorial video is available to guide users on how to effectively use the entire finance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Adding Income
Any income, particularly that related to client work, can be added and classified. For simplicity, income can be categorized as "client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Users can also create their own classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   To add new income, click "new income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Specify the income name (e.g., "Client Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Select "client" under classification, or type a new classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

All income transactions booked and classified under "client" in the finance setup will automatically reflect in the client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This ensures that non-client income (e.g., salary) is not included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Client Section

The client section provides a dedicated dashboard for client management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It has four main components:
1.  **Invoicing Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
2.  **Client Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
3.  **Project Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
4.  **Services Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> (displaying services offered to clients)

### Tools Section
Beneath the main components, there's a tools section:
*   **Resources Section**: For organizing all resources in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Contacts**: To store all business contact details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Goals Section**: For setting personal or business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Calendar**: For managing meeting schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Workflow Detail
At the bottom of the client section, a "workflow detail" displays all income classified as "client" from the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This is a filtered view, and users can customize filters for their own classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Managing Client Details
The client details section categorizes clients into three pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>:
*   **Lead**: Potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Negotiation**: Clients in the negotiation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

*   Specify the client name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Invoice Amount**: This amount automatically reflects the total invoices raised against the client, pulled from the workflow section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Contract Value**: This is manually input by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Percentage Invoiced**: Automatically updates based on the contract value and invoice amounts received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Client Properties**: Clicking on a client opens a new window with fields for company, contact details, email address, position, stage, and website details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. It also displays associated work details, such as booked income and invoice status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Clients can be dragged and dropped between pipeline categories (Lead, Negotiation, Client) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Project Details

Projects represent specific work orders or tasks undertaken for a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. A single contract can be divided into multiple projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Projects are categorized by priority: Low, Medium, and High <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

*   **Completion Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Project Completion Percentage**: This can be calculated in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>:
    1.  **Hourly Basis**: Based on estimated hours for completion and actual hours booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
    2.  **Invoicing Basis**: Based on the total project value and the invoices assigned to that project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Invoicing Section

The invoicing section helps manage the status of invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>, categorized by:
*   **Draft**: Invoices being prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
*   **Sent**: Invoices dispatched to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **Paid**: Invoices for which payment has been received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

Each category displays the total invoice amount and the number of invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Invoices
*   To add a new invoice, click "new" under the desired status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
*   Enter the **Invoice Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   Set the **Due Date** for the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
*   The **Invoice Amount** is automatically populated from the workflow section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### Workflow Integration
The "workflow" section at the bottom of the client dashboard contains all client-related income details carried forward from the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This is where the core integration happens:
*   **Invoice Column**: Assign a specific invoice to an income entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. Once assigned, the invoice amount will automatically update in the invoicing section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **Client Column**: Link the income to a specific client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>, which updates the client's invoice value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
*   **Project Column**: Assign the income to a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **Service Column**: Assign the income to a service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

#### Flexible Data Entry
Information can be added in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>:
1.  **Top-down**: Create client, project, and service details first, then link them in the workflow.
2.  **Bottom-up**: Directly create new invoices, clients, projects, or services from within the workflow section, and they will automatically appear in their respective top sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. For example, creating a new invoice in the workflow will automatically add it to the invoicing section with a "draft" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

#### Payment Mode
The "payment mode" column in the workflow indicates if payment for an income has been received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   If an invoice is not paid, the payment mode can be left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   Once payment is received, set the mode to "Bank" (or another method) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. This impacts the [[managing_accounts_for_personal_finances_in_notion | financial calculations]] in the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

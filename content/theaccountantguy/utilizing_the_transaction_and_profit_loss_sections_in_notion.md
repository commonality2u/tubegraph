This article explains how to utilize the [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | transaction section]] and [[tracking_profits_and_losses_within_notion | profit loss section]] within a Notion template designed for tracking tax payments and financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These sections are crucial for [[organizing_financial_transactions_in_notion | organizing financial transactions]] and understanding your financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | transaction section]] is where you record all your revenue and expense activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Transactions are categorized into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Data entered here automatically updates the summary sections, such as financial overviews and quarterly taxes payable, at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Entering Revenue Transactions

To add a new revenue transaction:
1.  Click on the "Add Revenue" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This will automatically create a new line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
2.  Select the relevant period (e.g., Quarter 3 for September) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. There are typically four pre-set periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  Choose the account, such as "Goods" or "Services," from the available revenue accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
4.  Enter the transaction amount (e.g., $1000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  Specify the tax rate (e.g., 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The tax payable amount will be automatically calculated (e.g., $80 for $1000 at 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

These entries contribute to the total revenue earned and tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Entering Expense Transactions

To add a new expense transaction:
1.  Click on the "Add Expense" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. A new line item will be added with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
2.  Select the period (e.g., Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
3.  Choose the expense account, such as "Purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
4.  Input the amount (e.g., $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Define the tax rate (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The input credit (e.g., $50 for $500 at 10%) will be automatically calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Expense entries help in availing input tax credit to offset tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Profit Loss Section

The [[tracking_profits_and_losses_within_notion | profit loss section]] provides a quick summary of your financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. It displays three key figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>:
*   **Total Revenue:** The aggregate income from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Expenses:** The total expenses incurred and booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Total Profit:** The net profit calculated from total revenue minus total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

These sections work together to provide a comprehensive view for [[managing_finances_with_notion | managing finances]] and tracking tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

The employee training expenses tracker provides a comprehensive overview and detailed sections for managing training-related expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Training Expense Overview

The training dashboard includes a "Training Overview" which summarizes key metrics, including a "training expense" for each individual training session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. All information presented in this overview is editable and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

On the left side of the dashboard, an "Expenses Overview" section provides a summary of all training expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>:
*   **Total Expense**: Reflects the total cost incurred for all conducted trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Number of Trainings**: A count of all the different training sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Employee Count**: Indicates the number of employees expected to attend training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Average Expense**: Shows the average expense incurred per employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

These figures automatically update as [[adding_and_managing_expenses | transaction details]] are entered in the dedicated "Training Expenses" section at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Training Expenses Section

Located at the bottom of the dashboard, the "Training Expenses" view allows for detailed [[tracking_expenses | expense tracking]] and editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. After a training record is added, you can view all associated trainings and their incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Editing Expenses
To edit expense information:
1.  Click the pencil icon associated with the training expense you wish to modify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
2.  Type in the new expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
3.  The system will automatically update the expense records across the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
    *   For example, changing an expense from $1,400 to $1,800 will immediately reflect the update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### View Customization
The "Training Expenses" view can be customized:
*   By default, it may show expenses in a specific format.
*   Users can switch to a "table view" by clicking on the three-dot menu, which allows for quick data entry and review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Currency Settings
All currency displayed within the tracker is customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   To change the currency in the "Training Expenses" section (e.g., in table view), click on the expense field, select "edit property," and choose the desired currency from the "number format" options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   For changing currency symbols displayed in the top dashboard overview, click on the information field itself. The dollar sign is typically integrated into the formula and can be adjusted there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

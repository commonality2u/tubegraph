The subscription expenses tracker in Notion allows users to [[setting_up_accounts_and_classifications | classify]] and [[managing_subscription_categories_and_statuses | manage subscriptions]] effectively by organizing them into various groups or categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This segmentation helps in viewing expenses by different types, such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Adding a New Group

To add a new subscription group:
1.  Navigate to the expenses section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  Click on the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  This action will provide an option to add a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Editing Existing Groups

Existing groups can be modified by clicking on them and changing their name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This feature supports [[adding_and_deleting_categories_in_notion | customization of categories]] to suit individual needs.

## Organizing Subscriptions within Groups

When a new subscription is added using the "Add Subscription" quick action button, it is automatically placed under a "Note" subscription category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. To organize this newly added subscription into a specific group or classification:
1.  Click on the three dots next to the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
2.  Move it to the desired classification, such as "Active" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
3.  Details of the subscription, such as its billing period or payment date, can then be [[editing_subscription_details_and_billing_periods | edited]] by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The tracker also allows for [[managing_subscription_categories_and_statuses | categorizing subscriptions]] based on their status, such as "Active" or "Canceled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Canceling a subscription by checking a box automatically moves it to the "Cancel" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, which is reflected in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

This article demonstrates how a specialized template can be utilized to [[tracking_inventory_status_and_transactions | track inventory]] for a small business, specifically focusing on [[calculating_and_understanding_profit_and_loss_in_an_investment_portfolio | calculating profit and loss]] from inventory sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Inventory Management Overview

The inventory management template offers three main views:
*   **Inventory Setup** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   **Inventory Portfolio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Inventory Status** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

The Inventory Setup section allows for [[classifying_inventory_into_categories | classification of inventory]] into raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For each inventory item, users can define an opening balance, opening number of units, an evaluation principle (e.g., FIFO, LIFO, WSC), and a reorder level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The Inventory Portfolio section displays the inventory value and available units after transactions, alongside a reorder status indicating low stock or surplus items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The Inventory Status view tracks the current physical status of inventory, such as "in transit" or "not sent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions: Purchases and Sales

The template includes a dedicated "transaction section" for [[monitoring_inventory_transactions | monitoring inventory transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This section is divided into purchases, sales, and a profit and loss view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Recording Purchases
Purchases are recorded with details such as date, description, account (inventory item), number of units, purchase price, and inventory status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Dates are bifurcated by month, with recent transactions appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A "buy inventory" quick action button automatically adds a purchase transaction to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Recording Sales
Similar to purchases, the sales section allows users to record details for any sales made, assisting in [[tracking_income_and_expenses | tracking income and expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Calculating Profit and Loss for Inventory Sales

The "profit loss section" is crucial for [[understanding_profit_and_loss_in_tax_tracking | understanding profit and loss]] on individual inventory sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

To calculate profit or loss for any sale, users must input the *purchase price* or *cost of manufacturing* associated with the particular sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

For example, if bread (a finished good) was sold for $40, and its manufacturing cost was $10, the $10 figure would be entered as the purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The template then automatically calculates the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

> "So this is like 40 less ten dollars which is thirty dollars multiplied by 30 units which is giving 900 profit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>

This feature helps businesses evaluate the total cost of finished goods, whether they are manufactured from [[classifying_inventory_into_categories | raw materials]] or purchased as finished products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. By accurately inputting these costs, the template provides a clear picture of the profitability of each inventory sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

The [[introduction_to_pdf_output_tool | PDF Output tool]] (PDFoutput.com) facilitates the bulk generation of PDF documents by integrating with Notion templates and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Connecting Notion for Document Generation

To begin [[integration_with_pdf_output_com_for_document_generation | document generation with PDF Output tool]], you need to log in to PDFoutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Duplicating Templates and Databases
Before connecting, it's necessary to duplicate the desired Notion template and its corresponding database to your local Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This can be done by navigating to the "Templates" section on PDFoutput.com, searching for the required template (e.g., "payment receipts"), and using the provided database and template links to duplicate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Adding Database and Template to PDF Output
Once duplicated, you connect your Notion database and template to the [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_document_generation | PDF Output tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This involves clicking "Add database" or "Add template," selecting your Notion workspace (e.g., "accountant guy workspace"), and then choosing the specific template and database pages to grant access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. After successful authentication, the selected database and template will be connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. You can then provide a connection name, such as "payment receipts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Mapping Data Fields
The [[features_of_pdfoutput_tool | PDF Output tool]] automatically maps database properties to template elements if consistent naming conventions are used (e.g., elements in curly braces in the template exactly match column names in the database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. If there are mismatches, you can manually map properties by searching for and selecting the correct corresponding elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Filter, search, and sorting options are available to assist with mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Generating and Managing Documents

### Bulk PDF Generation
After mapping, click "Create PDF" to generate the documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The tool processes each row in the database to create a separate PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. You can preview a sample document to check the output quality before downloading all generated PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The generated PDFs are clean and accurately populated with data from the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This process allows for [[using_pdfoutput_tool_for_bulk_pdf_generation | bulk PDF generation]] based on new entries in your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Managing Connections and Settings
The sidebar in the [[introduction_to_pdfoutput_tool | PDF Output tool]] provides several management options:
*   **Connections:** This section displays a list of all previously created connections, allowing you to quickly load an existing database and template without re-adding them manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Templates:** Browse a variety of predefined templates for different use cases, such as invoices, with more templates to be added over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Settings:**
    *   **Page Format:** Define the page format for your PDFs (default is A4, but other options are available) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   **Add Templates/Databases:** Add additional templates and databases to your account beyond the initial setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Upgrading and Support

### Subscription Upgrades
The free plan of the [[introduction_to_pdf_output_tool | PDF Output tool]] includes a "made with PDF output" watermark on generated PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. To remove this watermark and gain higher usage limits, users can upgrade to a paid subscription plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Feedback and Custom Templates
Users can submit feedback or questions through the "Feedback" window in the sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. For those wishing to use custom templates not predefined in the tool, a dedicated help section explains the steps for [[using_pdf_output_for_document_generation | generating documents]] in a custom PDF format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

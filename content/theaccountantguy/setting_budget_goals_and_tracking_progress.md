This article describes how a budgeting tracker tool can assist users in [[setting_and_monitoring_monthly_budgets | setting budget goals]] and [[tracking_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | tracking progress]] against those goals. The tool provides a comprehensive system for managing various financial components, offering both high-level summaries and detailed monthly breakdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Core Components of the Budget Tracker

The budgeting tracker is structured around five main financial components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

For each of these components, users can specify targeted or budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Setting Goals
*   **Income:** Users can set a "goal amount" for each income component for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Expenses:** A "budget amount" can be set for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This principle of setting a budget amount at the start of the month applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Tracking Progress and Performance

The tracker automatically updates as income is earned or expenses are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Key features for [[tracking_and_analyzing_actual_versus_budgeted_expenses | tracking actual versus budgeted expenses]] include:

*   **Percentage of Budget Incurred/Achieved:** The tracker displays a percentage indicating how much of the budgeted amount has been incurred for expenses or how much of the goal amount has been achieved for income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Budget Status:** A "budget status" indicator shows whether actual spending has gone "beyond the budgeted amount" or if the user has "stayed within the budgeted amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This applies uniformly across all components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Detailed Overviews:**
    *   For income, the tool shows the specific income amount, the set goal amount, and the total percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   For expenses, it displays the targeted amount and the actual expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Inputting Transactions
Users enter all transactions, whether income or expense, through dedicated buttons for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

For each transaction, the following details are typically recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:
*   **Detail:** A description of the transaction.
*   **Date:** The specific date of the transaction.
*   **Month and Year:** These are crucial for monthly and annual tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Users can add months and years as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Category:** A specific category for the income or expense source (e.g., salary, food, entertainment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. These categories can be edited by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Code:** A unique code for the source, often combining the category and month/year, used for collating data for different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This coding convention helps [[tracking_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | track specific months]] for different sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount:** Set at the beginning of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount:** The actual income received or expense incurred during the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Monthly and Annual Overviews
The tracker provides detailed summaries on a month-wise basis, allowing users to see how categories like food, entertainment, and shopping are performing under specific months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. As new transactions are added for different months, the summaries automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Funds Balance
A "funds balance" feature provides a quick glance at the income, total spendings (from expenses, debt payments, bills, and savings), and the remaining balance at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This allows for a clear understanding of the financial position at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Dynamic Filtering
All data within the tracker can be dynamically filtered by year or specific month, allowing users to analyze their [[creating_and_monitoring_budgets | budgeting data]] for particular periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

This [[budgeting_tools | budgeting tool]] aims to solve the overall purpose of [[setting_and_managing_budgets_for_expenses | setting and managing budgets]] and [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | tracking expenses]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

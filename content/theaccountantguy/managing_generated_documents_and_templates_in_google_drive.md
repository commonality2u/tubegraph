PDFoutput.com is a tool designed to [[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents | generate PDF documents in bulk]] by utilizing Google Docs as templates and a Notion database for data [00:00:02]. This process involves managing both the template documents and the generated output files within Google Drive.

## Utilizing Google Docs as Templates

PDFoutput.com connects directly with your Google Drive to access template documents [00:00:46].
To use a Google Doc as a template:
1.  Navigate to PDFoutput.com and sign in with your Google account [00:00:10].
2.  Enable access to specific files for PDFoutput [00:00:22].
3.  Click the "add Google document" link within PDFoutput [00:01:08].
4.  Select the desired Google Document from your Google Drive [00:00:46]. For example, an "invitation letter PDF output invitation letter" document can be chosen as a template [00:00:49].
5.  The selected document will load into PDFoutput for configuration [00:01:18].

The template document can be configured with placeholders (e.g., `first name`, `last name`) that will be replaced with data fetched from a [[integrating_notion_databases_with_google_docs | Notion database]] during the generation process [00:00:57].

### Predefined Templates
In addition to using your own Google Docs, PDFoutput offers predefined templates that can be used for various purposes [00:06:26]. These templates are readily available to simplify the document creation process [00:06:30].

## Saving Generated PDFs to Google Drive

After configuring your template and data source, you can define where the generated PDF files will be saved [00:03:59].
To save documents to Google Drive:
1.  In PDFoutput, select "Google Drive" as the output file destination [00:04:01].
2.  It is recommended to [[generating_and_downloading_pdf_documents | create a dedicated folder]] in your Google Drive for the generated documents [00:04:07]. For instance, a folder named "invitation documents" or "invitation docs" can be created [00:04:14].
3.  Once the folder is created in Google Drive, click "add folder" in PDFoutput and select the newly created folder [00:04:26]. This sets your Google Drive folder as the output location [00:04:32].

Alternatively, you can choose to save the generated files directly to your desktop's downloads folder [00:04:35].

## Exporting and Viewing Generated Documents

Once all settings are configured, click "export PDF" to begin the generation process [00:05:15]. The generated documents will be saved to the specified Google Drive folder [00:05:19].

After the generation is complete, you can click "view in Google Drive" from within PDFoutput to directly open the folder containing the newly created PDFs [00:05:50]. This allows for easy access and review of the bulk-generated documents [00:05:58].

## History of Generated Documents

PDFoutput also maintains a history feature, allowing users to view all documents that have been generated in the past [00:06:33]. This provides a record of past PDF generation tasks and can be useful for tracking and retrieval.

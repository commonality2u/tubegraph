This article provides an [[utilizing_business_cash_flow_templates | overview]] of how to [[utilizing_business_cash_flow_templates | utilize a business cash flow template]] to [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | track your cash flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Cash Flow Overview

The template's cash flow overview section includes a summary of your financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
It displays:
- The opening balance of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
- Total cash inflow from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
- Total cash outflow from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
- The closing balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

These balances automatically update as you [[tracking_and_entering_transactions_in_a_business_expense_tracker | enter transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Key Sections

On the right side of the overview, there are three main sections:
- Account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
- [[overview_of_quarterly_cash_flow_and_business_activities | Quarterly overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
- Business activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

### Account Section

This section allows you to set up and manage different accounts under various heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

#### Assets
Default asset categories include cash, bank, receivables, input taxes, and other receivables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. You can add your own assets or edit existing ones by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

For each asset, you can define:
-   **Opening Balance**: The starting balance of the asset when you begin using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
-   **Classifications**: How the specific item is categorized, e.g., a credit card classified as a debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. New classifications can be added or existing ones edited via a three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
-   **Payment Frequency**: How frequently payment is received for a particular item, useful for [[tracking_transactions_and_payment_percentages | tracking income]] and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
-   **Opening Units**: Relevant for investments or inventory, such as 10 opening units for inventory with an opening balance of $1300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
-   **Asset Class**: Useful for categorizing inventory items under "inventory asset class" or investments under "investment asset class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

#### Liabilities, Income, and Expenses
The same principles for adding or editing items apply to Liabilities, Income, and Expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. You can add new items by clicking "new" under the respective categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Quarterly Overview

The [[overview_of_quarterly_cash_flow_and_business_activities | quarterly overview]] provides a summary of cash flow movement for each month, divided into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
Each quarter displays:
-   **Inflow**: How much cash entered the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
-   **Outflow**: How much cash left the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
-   **Net Balance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

These figures update automatically as you [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | add transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Business Activity

This section categorizes cash flow into three types of business activities:
-   **Operating Activities**: Relates to core business operations like salary payments or revenue receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
-   **Investing Activities**: Involves investments made by the business, such as stock or mutual fund investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
-   **Financing Activities**: Pertains to raising loans or debt to run the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Each activity type shows its respective inflow, outflow, and net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

The template provides different views for [[using_the_transactions_tab_for_income_and_expenses | entering transactions]], including Income, Expense, Asset, Liability, Investments, and Inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Adding an Income Transaction

To add an income transaction:
1.  Click "Add Income" on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This automatically adds a transaction with the current date, which can be changed using the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
2.  **Period**: Specify the period (e.g., January 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

4.  **Account**: Select the relevant account from those added earlier (e.g., Sales Revenue account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
5.  **Payment Mode**: Indicate how the payment was received (e.g., cash or bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
6.  **Amount**: Enter the monetary value received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> All entered transactions automatically update the operating activities section and the total cash inflow/outflow figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. If figures do not update immediately, clicking on the sum or balance options can refresh them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Expenses, Assets, and Liabilities

Similarly, you can use the "Add Expense," "Add Asset," and "Add Liability" buttons to record these [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | transaction types]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Investments

The Inventory section allows you to record the total [[tracking_inventory_transactions | inventory value]] purchased at its purchase price and inventory sold at its sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. You can indicate units and price, and the template will automatically [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss | calculate profit or loss]] on the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

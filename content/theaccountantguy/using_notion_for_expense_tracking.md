[[using_notion_for_expense_management | Using Notion for expense management]] allows users to track business expenses, particularly for specific use cases like construction projects, through dedicated templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This provides a quick and easy way to keep track of project expenses in one central location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Template Overview

The Notion template for construction project expense tracking is structured to provide clear visibility into financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Expense Categories
The template features different categories of expenses defined at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each category, both a budgeted expense amount and the actual expenses are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Data Input and Dynamic Updates
Actual expenses are pulled from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Users can modify values within this table, and the expenses are updated dynamically to reflect the changes corresponding to their categories at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This feature supports [[using_notion_to_edit_and_update_expense_details | editing and updating expense details]] efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Managing Categories
The template offers flexibility in managing expense categories:
*   **Editing Categories:** To edit an existing category, click on the pencil icon associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This allows users to define new categories tailored to their specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Adding Categories:** A new category can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories:** To remove a category, click on the three-dot menu and select the "delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Defining Budgeted Expenses
Users can define or adjust the budgeted expense amount for any requirement by simply clicking on the budgeted expense field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Summary Section
A summary section provides a concise [[overview_of_notion_expense_tracker | overview of the Notion expense tracker]] data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This includes:
*   The total budgeted expense that was previously defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   The total actual expenses pulled from the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

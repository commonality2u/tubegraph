From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 

The Notion employee training expenses tracker provides a comprehensive dashboard for managing training activities and associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04"></a>. This system features two main views: a training overview and employee records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08"></a>.

## Training Dashboard Overview

The dashboard offers a high-level summary of all trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13"></a>. Key information displayed includes:
*   **Training Date** The scheduled date for each training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21"></a>.
*   **Employees Count** The total number of employees expected to attend a specific training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24"></a>.
*   **Percentage of Attendance** The proportion of employees who actually attended the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29"></a>.
*   **Training Expense** The cost incurred for each training session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34"></a>.

All these displayed parameters are editable and customizable via settings located at the bottom of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a>.

## Employee Records Management

The employee record section lists employees, categorized by their respective departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a>.

### Managing Departments
*   **Editing Departments** Departments can be edited directly by clicking on the department name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50"></a>.
*   **Adding New Departments** New departments can be added by holding a slider to the right and clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01"></a>.
*   **Moving Employees Between Departments** Employees can be reassigned to different departments by dragging their entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15"></a> or by using the three-dot menu next to their record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54"></a>.

### Employee Information Display
Each individual employee record reflects:
*   The total number of trainings they have attended (e.g., "Steve attended two out of three trainings") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24"></a>.
*   Their overall percentage of attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36"></a>.
*   The next scheduled training date, which can be selected by clicking on the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38"></a>.
*   The number of days remaining until their next training from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48"></a>.

### Adding and Editing Employee Details
*   **Adding Employees** New employee records can be added using the "Add Employee" quick action button, initially appearing under a "No Department" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47"></a>. These can then be moved to the correct department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53"></a>. It's recommended to use this quick action button for adding employees rather than directly within the training record database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43"></a>.
*   **Editing Employees** Employee details can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button next to their name and typing the new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00"></a>.

## Expenses Overview

On the left side of the dashboard, an expenses overview provides key financial metrics for trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06"></a>:
*   **Total Expense** The cumulative expense incurred for all trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08"></a>.
*   **Number of Trainings** The total count of all conducted trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12"></a>.
*   **Employees Expected to Attend** The total number of employees registered for trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19"></a>.
*   **Average Expense** The average expense per employee for trainings, which updates automatically upon transaction entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25"></a>.

This Notion template provides a simple system to [[tracking_hotel_bookings_in_notion | track hotel bookings]], including detailed information on room types and guest preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It allows for efficient management of hotel reservations by centralizing guest data and booking specifics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The template features two main KPIs at the top for a quick overview of booking data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

*   **Bookings by Room Type**: Shows the number of bookings made for different room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Underneath each room type, the total number of guests who have booked that specific room is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests**: Tracks how many guests require a free pickup service, with a "Yes" or "No" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This provides a summary of guests needing or not needing pickup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Hotel Booking Tracker Table

The core of the template is a simple table at the bottom, designed to capture detailed guest and booking information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This table allows for [[managing_customer_information_in_notion | managing customer information]] alongside booking specifics.

### Guest and Request Details

*   **Guest Name, Email ID, Contact Details**: Standard fields for capturing essential guest information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Special Request**: A field for any specific requests from the guest, serving as a flexible placeholder for additional notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Dates and Times

*   **Arrival Date**: Records the guest's arrival date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Users can opt to include time in this field for precise arrival scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Departure Date**: Records the guest's departure date. This field also supports including specific times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Room Type Management

The template allows for dynamic management of room types:

*   **Selecting Room Types**: Users can select from a pre-defined list of room types that fit their use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Adding New Room Types**: New room types can be easily added by simply typing a new name, which automatically creates a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Customizing Icons**: The icon for any room type can be changed by selecting a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Automatic Updates**: Changes made to room types in the table are automatically reflected in the KPI summary at the top, ensuring data synchronization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Guest Count and Free Pickup

*   **Guest Count**: This column allows entry of the number of guests for a particular reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. While not displayed in the top KPI by default, it can be added through customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Column**: Guests' preference for free pickup can be selected as "Yes" or "No", which updates the corresponding KPI summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

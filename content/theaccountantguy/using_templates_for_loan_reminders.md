This article demonstrates how to set up debt payment reminders that are delivered via WhatsApp notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The system can be [[automating_loan_payment_notifications | automated]] for any number of loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## How Loan Reminders Work

When a loan payment is due, a notification is sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
For example, for a car loan of $3,000 due on September 23, a message might read: "Hi there, this is a reminder for payment of car loan which is due on September 23 for an amount of three thousand dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

The reminder message includes a "pay now" link that redirects to a bank portal or a payment service like PayPal, allowing for instant loan repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Any relevant payment link can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Setting Up Payment Reminders

To receive debt payment reminders on WhatsApp, the first step is to create a template for each loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Creating a Loan Template

1.  **Select "New Template"**: From a drop-down menu, choose the option to create a new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  **Enter Loan Details**: Input specific loan details, such as the loan type (e.g., car loan) and the repayment amount (e.g., $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Configuring Template Repetition

Each new template includes an option for repeating the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This feature automatically populates all values within the template for a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

*   **Set Repetition Frequency**: For monthly loan payments, select "every month" to have the information appear in the database each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Choose Repetition Day and Time**: Specify a particular day of the month (e.g., 16th) and a specific time for the line item to be automatically added to the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Save Information**: After configuration, save the template details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Setting Notification Timing

Users can choose when to receive the notification relative to the loan's due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

*   **Advance Notification**: To receive a notification a certain number of days before the actual due date (e.g., 7 days), input that number of days into the template setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **On Due Date Notification**: If the notification is desired on the same day as the actual due date, input "0" for the number of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Once a recurring template is set for each loan, it will automatically trigger an [[automating_loan_payment_notifications | automation]] to send the payment notification message to WhatsApp each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Automation Demonstration

The system automatically adds new loan entries based on the set template schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. For example, if an education loan template is set to occur at 3:55 PM on September 16, a new loan entry will automatically populate the database at that exact time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Once populated, a payment alert message is triggered and sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

This automation allows for the management and repayment of any number of loans with simple techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Customization and Management

*   **Custom Messages**: Users can [[customizing_payment_reminder_messages | create custom messages]] for their reminders as per their requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The system is completely customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **[[managing_and_deleting_payment_reminder_templates | Deleting Templates]]**: After all loan amounts have been repaid, users can delete any added templates to prevent repeated notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

This budgeting tracker provides a comprehensive system to manage financial requirements by categorizing income, expenses, debts, bills, and savings. It offers various features for [[setting_and_monitoring_monthly_budgets | setting goals and budgets]], tracking actual amounts, and monitoring financial health with real-time updates and detailed overviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Core Components and Budgeting

The tracker is built around five main financial components:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

For each component, users can define a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. For instance, income has a "goal amount" and expenses have a "budget amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. As transactions are incurred, the system automatically updates the progress, showing the percentage of the budgeted amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. A "budget status" indicator reveals whether spending is within or beyond the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This system applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions

All transactional inputs are managed within a dedicated section of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Quick Input Buttons
Quick buttons are available for adding new income or expense entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Clicking an "income" button, for example, automatically creates a new income entry dated for the current day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Transaction Details
For each transaction, the following details can be entered:
*   **Detail**: A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Date**: The specific date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Month & Year**: The month and year of the transaction, which can be custom-typed (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Category**: A specific classification for the income or expense (e.g., "salary," "side hustle," "food," "entertainment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Users can [[setting_up_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | add and edit categories]] as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Code**: A unique identifier to collate specific sources of income or expense across different months, ensuring consistent tracking (e.g., "side ASL income for Jan 2024," "food element food category Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount**: The planned amount for a specific category at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount**: The actual income received or expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

The currency can be customized from the default dollar to any other preferred currency by editing the number format property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Overviews and Summaries

The tracker provides several summary views to help users [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | understand their financial position]].

### Aggregate Overview
On the left side, an overview aggregates data for all different elements of each component. Users can select a component (e.g., "income overview") from a dropdown to see a list of categories (e.g., salary, side hustle), along with the specific income amount, goal amount, and percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This view provides a cumulative summary across all months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Monthly Overview
Below the main components, a detailed monthly overview is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This section provides a month-wise division of financial activities for each category and element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. For example, under "expenses summary," it shows categories like "food," "entertainment," and "shopping" broken down by month (e.g., Jan 2024, Feb 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. As new monthly data is entered (e.g., a February food expense), the system automatically updates the relevant monthly view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Dynamic Filtering
All summary views support dynamic filtering by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Users can filter to view data for:
*   A specific year (e.g., 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   A particular month across all years (e.g., January across multiple years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   A specific month within a specific year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

This flexibility allows for granular analysis of spending and income trends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Funds Balance
A "funds balance" view provides a quick glance at the financial position at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. It displays:
*   Total income for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   Total spendings (combining expenses, debt payments, bill payments, and savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   The remaining balance amount at the end of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This balance automatically updates as income and expense entries are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The funds balance view can also be dynamically filtered by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

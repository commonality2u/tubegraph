[[introduction_to_wizzygen_platform_for_ai_generated_content | Wizzygen]] is a platform designed to facilitate the creation of AI-generated content directly within a Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Methods of Content Creation

Within [[introduction_to_wizzygen_platform_for_ai_generated_content | Wizzygen]], there are two primary options for [[using_wizzygen_to_generate_content_with_ai_prompts | creating AI generated content]]:
*   Notion Database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   Notion Page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

A Notion page is defined as a simple blank page within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A Notion database, conversely, is structured in the form of rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The platform allows for the generation of AI content on both of these formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## [[creating_content_on_notion_pages | Generating Content on Notion Pages]]

To generate content on a Notion page, the user must first specify the Notion page connection and provide the URL of the target Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. After configuration, the AI can generate content based on a specified prompt. For example, a prompt like "write me a block of 100 words on notion" can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The AI will then generate and populate the content directly onto the selected Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## [[creating_content_in_notion_databases | Generating Content in Notion Databases]]

[[using_wizzygen_for_content_automation | AI content generation]] is also possible for Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Similar to pages, the user names the connection and provides the URL for the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Databases typically contain multiple topics or entries, organized in rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. A single prompt can be applied to generate content for each topic within the database. An example prompt is "write me a block of 100 words on the topic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Upon execution, the AI generates content for each individual row, populating the database entries with the generated text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Ultimately, [[introduction_to_wizzygen_platform_for_ai_generated_content | Wizzygen]] provides a versatile solution for generating AI content for both Notion pages and Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

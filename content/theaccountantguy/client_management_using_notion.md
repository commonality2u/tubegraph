Notion Books Freelancers OS is a dashboard designed to help freelancers manage their finances, including income and expense details, and to assist with client management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Upon downloading the setup, users land on a page with quick instructions, including how to change the currency, explained in a video demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The dashboard features two main navigation windows: the Finance section and the Client section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Navigating the Dashboard
The system has two primary navigation areas:
*   **Finance Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>: This area allows users to track income and expenses. A dedicated tutorial video explains how to use this setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Income related to clients can be added here and classified as "client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Any income classified under "client" in the finance section will automatically reflect in the client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Client Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>: Clicking on "Client" in the navigation bar takes the user to a dedicated client management dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Client Section Overview
The Client section organizes information into several key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>:
*   **Primary Details**:
    *   Invoicing Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
    *   Client Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
    *   Project Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    *   Services Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
*   **Tool Section**:
    *   [[inventory_management_using_notion | Resources]]: A place to store all relevant resources under one category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   [[setting_up_customer_and_vendor_details_in_notion | Contacts]]: For storing all business contact details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

    *   [[managing_events_with_notion | Calendar]]: For managing meeting schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Workflow Detail**: Displays all income classified under "client" from the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This section filters out non-client related income like salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## [[managing_guest_information_in_notion | Managing Guest Information in Notion | Client Details]]
The system allows tracking client information through a pipeline with three stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>:
1.  **Lead**: For potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
2.  **Negotiation**: For clients in the process of negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
3.  **Client**: For active clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Users can add new clients by clicking the "new" option in any category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Client details include:
*   Client Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>
*   Invoice Amount: Automatically pulled from related invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   Contract Value: Manually entered by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   Percentage of Work Invoiced: Calculated based on the contract value and raised invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Clicking on a client's entry opens a new window with more details, including:
*   Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   Contact Detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>

*   Related work details, showing booked income, invoice status, and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Project Management
Projects are defined as specific work performed to fulfill a work order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. They can be tracked under different priority levels:
*   Low Priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>
*   Medium Priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>

To add a new project, click the "new" button and specify details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>:

*   Project Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>

Clicking on a project reveals more details and properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>:
*   Status and Priority can be updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

*   Related work details, showing linked income and clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

## Service Management
For each client, there can be multiple projects, and for each project, there can be multiple services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. Services are categorized by status:
*   Not Started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>
*   In Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>
*   Completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>

To add a new service, click "new" and provide the service name and pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Service pricing can be set on an hourly basis or as a fixed flat rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
Service details include:
*   Service Duration/Deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   Rate and Service Pricing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>

*   Related work details, indicating the client, project, and total service value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

## [[overview_and_transaction_management_in_notion | Invoice Management]]
The invoicing section tracks invoices based on their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>:
*   Draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>
*   Sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>
*   Paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>

The total invoice amount is displayed for each status, and users can view the number of invoices or their sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.
To add a new invoice, click "new" and input the invoice number and due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
The invoice amount is automatically pulled from the Workflow section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

### Workflow Integration
The Workflow section at the bottom of the client dashboard aggregates all client-assigned income from the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Each income entry has four columns to link it to:
*   Invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>
*   Client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>
*   Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>
*   Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>

Filling these fields automatically updates the respective sections (Invoices, Clients, Projects, Services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Users can also create new invoices, clients, projects, or services directly from the workflow section, and they will be automatically added to their respective categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
The workflow also includes a "Payment Mode" field, indicating if payment has been received (e.g., "Bank"). Removing this field for an invoice indicates that payment has not yet been received, automatically updating the finance view for banking calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

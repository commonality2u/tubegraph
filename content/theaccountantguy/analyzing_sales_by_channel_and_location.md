The Sales Performance OS is a template designed to help businesses [[overview_of_notion_sales_performance_os | track and analyze sales data]], including performance by channel and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The [[analyzing_financial_data_in_a_dashboard | dashboard]] offers a comprehensive overview of sales activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Sales Dashboard Components

The sales [[analyzing_financial_data_in_a_dashboard | dashboard]] displays three main components at the top: salesperson, sales channel, and sales location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These sections are bifurcated by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Sales Channel
This component represents the various sources from which sales have been made, such as a website, Instagram, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For each channel, the following statistics are displayed:
*   Sales achieved for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Targeted sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Percentage of targeted sales achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Target status (achieved/not achieved) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>

Users can add their own [[customizing_and_managing_sales_data | custom categories]] for sales channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Sales Location
This section shows where sales have been made across different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It displays the same characteristics as the sales channel, including sales achieved, targeted sales, percentage achieved, and target status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Sales Overviews

On the left side of the [[analyzing_financial_data_in_a_dashboard | dashboard]], there are detailed overviews for sales channels and locations.

### Sales Channel Overview
This overview provides information on:
*   Total sales made through each channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   Sale units sold by each channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Average sales per unit for each channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>

### Sales Location Overview
Similar to the channel overview, this section details:
*   Total sales made to each location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   Average sales for each location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Sale units for each location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

These overviews help track and provide a comprehensive view of business performance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Adding Sales Transactions

Sales transactions can be added through a dedicated window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The transaction details include date, account details (e.g., salesperson), sales details (what is being sold), month, and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Sales Channel Data Entry
For sales channels, users can input:
*   Sales channel information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>
*   A unique referral code specific to each channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>
*   Month and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   Sales amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   Referral target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

### Sales Location Data Entry
For sales locations, users can specify:
*   A unique location tag, including the location name, month, and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Target sales amount for the location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
*   Actual sales amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>

Both channels and locations can have targeted sales assigned at the beginning of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. A "quick action button" allows automatically assigning targets for a particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Once details are entered for the salesperson, the specific channel and referral code, and target will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Customization and Data Management

The entire [[analyzing_financial_data_in_a_dashboard | dashboard]] is [[customizing_and_managing_sales_data | customizable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Currency
The currency for the entire [[analyzing_financial_data_in_a_dashboard | dashboard]] can be changed to any preferred currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This is done by editing the property number format for amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Filtering Data
Users can filter the displayed data by:
*   **Year**: By adding a filter for "year," users can select any particular year to view only sales relevant to that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Month**: Similarly, filtering by "month" allows viewing data for specific months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Combinations**: Filters can be combined to view data for specific months within a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

These filtration options help in deeper analysis of sales performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

A Notion-based [[creating_a_sinking_funds_tracker_in_notion | sinking funds tracker]] provides a comprehensive dashboard for an overview of all created sinking funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This dashboard is designed to provide a summary of savings progress and track individual fund contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Summary Section

The summary section of the dashboard presents a consolidated view of all [[sinking_funds_analysis | sinking funds]] combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. It indicates:
*   The overall goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   The total amount saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>
*   The amount left to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>
*   The contribution made in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>

This section is linked to the "Total Sinking Funds" database, displayed in a gallery view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Sinking Funds Overview

The [[sinking_funds_analysis | sinking funds]] overview provides a detailed look at all six types of [[types_of_sinking_funds_education_events_family_healthcare_transportation_utilities | sinking funds]] created, such as education, events, family, healthcare, transportation, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. For each fund, it displays:
*   The goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>
*   The amount saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>
*   The amount left to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
*   The contribution in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
*   The end goal date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>
*   The required contribution for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>

These details are linked to the "Sinking Fund Summary" database, also presented in a gallery layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The "Sinking Fund Summary" database helps create a summarized form of the entire tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Sinking Funds Progress

The [[tracking_savings_and_contributions_for_sinking_funds | sinking funds progress]] section monitors monthly payments made towards each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. It indicates whether contributions meet the minimum required criteria:
*   A green tick appears if the contribution for any month exceeds the minimum required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   A red cross appears if the contribution does not meet the minimum required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

This progress view is linked to the "Individual Sinking Funds Details" database and displayed in a list format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

All values displayed in these dashboard sections are calculated by rolling up respective data from various underlying Notion databases, including the "Sinking Funds" and "Sinking Funds Details" databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

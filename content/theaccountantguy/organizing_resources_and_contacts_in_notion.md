The Notion Books Freelancers OS provides a dashboard for freelancers to track finances and manage clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Within this system, specific sections are dedicated to organizing valuable resources and managing contacts, aiding in efficient business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

## Resources Section

The Resources section serves as a repository for highly useful information relevant to a freelancer's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

### Categories
Resources are curated under four primary categories:
*   Checklists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>
*   Guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>
*   Strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>
*   Tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>

Users can also define their own resource categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

### Adding a New Resource
To add a new resource:
1.  Click the "New" button within the desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.
2.  Provide a name for the resource, such as "Taxes in Checkers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.
3.  Assign a category (e.g., Taxes, Budgeting, Investments, or Savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
4.  Add a relevant link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

### Adding Notes and Content
Once a resource is created, clicking on it opens a new window where more details can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. Users can input notes and structured content by typing a forward slash (`/`) to access various options, such as creating a "to-do list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. This allows for detailed information to be displayed within the resource entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

## Contacts Section

The Contacts section allows users to store and manage contact details for various people they interact with in their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

### Default Categories

*   Services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>
*   Legal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>

Users have the flexibility to create their own contact categories as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

This guide demonstrates how to set up and receive subscription payment reminders directly on WhatsApp using a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## How to Set Up Reminders

The process involves creating a new template within a database, specifying subscription details, and configuring repetition settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### [[creating_a_template_for_whatsapp_notification | Creating a New Template]]

To begin, you will:
*   Click on a drop-down menu in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   Select the option to "create a new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Choose "subscription reminder alert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Customizing Reminder Messages

You will specify the details for your subscription:
*   **Subscription Name:** For example, "Spotify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Subscription Amount:** For instance, $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Click "background" to add the new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A new template will appear in your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### [[steps_for_scheduling_payment_reminders_with_repetition | Scheduling Repetition]]

To make the reminder recurring:
1.  Click on the three dots next to the newly added template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  Select "repeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
3.  Choose your desired repetition mode, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This will ensure the subscription reminder repeats monthly with the specified amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Configuring Time and Date

After selecting the repetition mode, a new window will open where you can specify:
*   The **exact time** for the reminder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   The **date** from which you want the reminders to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For example, if today is September 23rd, you can set the reminder for 11:56 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   The system will repeat the message every month on the specified day (e.g., the 23rd) at the exact time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
4.  Click "Save" to finalize the repetition settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. An arrow icon will indicate that the reminder is set to repeat automatically every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Receiving Notifications on WhatsApp

Once the reminder is set, the system will automatically add a new line item in your database at the scheduled time each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Subsequently, you will [[receiving_automated_notifications_on_whatsapp | receive an automated notification alert]] on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The WhatsApp notification will be a payment reminder for the subscription amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### [[integration_of_pay_now_links_in_whatsapp_notifications | Pay Now Link Integration]]

The reminder message on WhatsApp will include a "pay now" link, allowing you to pay the amount directly through the provided link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Customization

The reminder alerts you receive on WhatsApp are fully customizable to meet your specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. There is no fixed template, allowing you to tailor the messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Instructions and a guide on setting up this automation are available upon downloading the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

This article outlines how to [[managing_finances_with_notion | manage finances]] and [[tracking_net_worth_in_notion | track net worth]] using a Notion setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The tracker is divided into several key sections to provide a comprehensive overview of your financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Overview of the Notion Financial Tracker

The Notion financial tracker is structured around three main sections:
*   **Net Worth Target** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Account Section** (for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **Summary Section** (showing finances at a glance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

Additional dedicated sections include:
*   **Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Budget** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   **Savings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   **Bills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   **Subscriptions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   **Transactions** (where all financial activities are fed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>

All these sections are interconnected and affect your overall [[tracking_net_worth_in_notion | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## [[building_a_net_worth_tracker_with_notion | Building a Net Worth Tracker with Notion]]: Step-by-Step

### 1. Setting a Net Worth Target
To begin, specify your net worth target for the entire financial year in the "Net Worth Goal" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. This goal can be easily modified at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

### 2. Setting Up Accounts
The first step in [[tracking_income_expenses_assets_and_liabilities_in_notion | tracking income and expenses]] is to navigate to the "Account section" under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Here, you can define different accounts for:

*   **Assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Liabilities** (including debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

For each account, you can:
*   Add a new account or modify existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Specify an opening balance (for assets/liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

This article details a simple [[customizing_notion_template_for_hotel_reservations | Notion]] template designed to track hotel bookings effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>

The template is structured with two key performance indicator (KPI) sections at the top and a detailed booking table at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Data entered in the main table automatically reflects in the KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

The top section provides a quick summary of bookings:
*   **Bookings by Room Type** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>: Shows the number of bookings made for different room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Underneath each room type, the total number of guests who have booked that specific room is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>: Indicates how many guests require a free pickup service (Yes/No) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This section shows the count of guests who have asked for pickup versus those who have not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Booking Details Table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>

A simple table at the bottom allows for detailed entry of each booking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   **Guest Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Email ID** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   **Contact Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **Special Request** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>: A customizable field for any specific guest requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Arrival Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>: Allows for date entry, with an option to include time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Departure Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>: Similar to arrival date, time can also be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Room Type** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>: A selectable field where users can choose from predefined room types or add new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Adding a new room type automatically updates the KPI section at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Icons for room types can also be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Guest Count** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>: To specify the number of guests for a reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This information is not currently displayed in the top KPIs but can be added with customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>: A simple Yes/No option which updates the free pickup summary in the KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>

The template is fully customizable to suit individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

This article details the process of generating PDF documents, such as boarding passes, by loading information from a database and exporting it using a template in [[using_notion_for_client_management | Notion]].

## Prerequisites
To generate PDF documents in [[using_notion_for_client_management | Notion]], two main components are required:
*   A database containing the necessary details, such as a "boarding pass database" holding all boarding pass information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This relates to [[setting_up_databases_and_relationships_in_notion | setting up databases in Notion]].
*   A template, such as a "boarding pass template," from which the PDF document will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Generating PDF Documents
The process involves connecting the database to the template and initiating the export.

### Connection and Loading
1.  Access the connection details for "PDF output" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This is part of [[managing_pdf_export_and_connections_in_notion | managing PDF export and connections in Notion]].
2.  Type in the name of the database, for instance, "boarding pass database," to connect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
3.  Select the relevant template, such as the "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  Once initiated, the system begins loading all information from the [[setting_up_databases_and_relationships_in_notion | database]] and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Exporting and Previewing
Once the information is loaded:
1.  Click "export" to start generating the PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This is a core function of [[managing_pdf_export_and_connections_in_notion | managing PDF export in Notion]].
2.  Upon successful export, a preview sample can be viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
3.  The preview demonstrates that the boarding pass has been generated with all the details from the original [[setting_up_databases_and_relationships_in_notion | database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Downloading and Accessing Files
After previewing, the generated PDF files can be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Once downloaded, the files can be opened and extracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Multiple PDF outputs will be generated, each with different names and contexts, corresponding to the entries in the [[setting_up_databases_and_relationships_in_notion | database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This process demonstrates how to leverage PDF output functionality to generate documents directly from [[using_notion_for_client_management | Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

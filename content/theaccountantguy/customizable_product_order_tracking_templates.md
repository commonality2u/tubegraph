A customizable template is available to help businesses keep track of customer product orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This template can be used to [[using_notion_to_track_product_orders | track product orders]] and is designed to be entirely customizable to meet specific business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Key Information Tracked

The template includes a database designed to capture essential details for each product order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   **Product Details**
    *   Product name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   **Customer Information**
    *   Customer name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>

    *   Amount for the particular order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

## Order Summary and Analytics

At the top of the template, an order summary section provides an overview of placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   **Total Order Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   **Number of Orders Placed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Number of Customers** who have placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   **Gift Item Percentage**: This shows the percentage of customers looking to place products as gift items, which dynamically updates with changes to individual order values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For example, if 67% of customers are looking to place items as gifts, this percentage will change when individual values are altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

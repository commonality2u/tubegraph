The [[using_the_purchase_order_tracker_template_in_notion | purchase order tracker template]] is designed to be adaptable, with several options for customization and future enhancements planned for related tools.

## Customizing the Purchase Order Database

The template allows for significant modification to fit specific needs:
*   Users can duplicate existing columns for description, quantity, and unit price to add more items to a purchase order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   When duplicating columns, users must update the subtotal formula to include the new values for accurate calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Similarly, when adding more descriptions and quantities, it's essential to update the formulas for the purchase order summary at the top to ensure the total purchases, units ordered, and average order value reflect the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

For those requiring further customization beyond these basic adjustments, direct assistance is available by reaching out via email at notionformyuse@gmail.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This support is offered to help users tailor the template to their specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## PDF Document Generation Tool Updates

When generating PDF documents for purchase orders via PDF output.com, users have options for feedback and future updates:

### Template and Currency Requests
*   If a desired currency is not available within the dropdown menu, users can submit a request for its inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   Similarly, if a specific template is needed but not listed, users can request it through the provided window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Upcoming Features
*   **Notion Integration**: An integration with Notion databases is planned for the near future. This will allow users to directly select their Notion database from the PDF generation tool and export PDFs by reading information directly from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This means data from the [[using_the_purchase_order_tracker_template_in_notion | purchase order tracker template]] could be directly used for PDF generation without manual input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **New Templates**: The platform anticipates releasing many different templates in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Providing Feedback
A feedback window is available for users to send any suggestions or comments about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This feedback is taken into consideration to continuously improve the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

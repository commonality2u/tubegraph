The savings funds tracker provides a dashboard to manage and monitor personal savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It features two primary views: "Savings Target" for setting goals and "Savings Overview" for tracking progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This tool aids in [[calculating_and_tracking_savings_goals | calculating and tracking savings goals]] and offers a comprehensive [[personal_finance_tracking | personal finance tracking]] solution.

## Savings Target View

The "Savings Target" view allows users to define different saving funds and their corresponding goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Editing Savings Funds
To edit an existing saving fund, click the pencil button next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. You can rename the fund, for example, changing "Saving Fund" to "Car Fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Similarly, you can adjust the goal amount, such as changing it from $2,500 to $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Any changes made here are automatically updated in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Alternatively, you can click on the fund itself to open all editing options, including renaming and setting the goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds
To add a new saving fund, click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A new entry will appear, which you can then name (e.g., "New Saving Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. By default, it may be added with a $1,000 goal, which can be customized to any desired amount, like $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds
To delete a saving fund, click on the six dots to the left of the fund name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This will reveal a "Delete" option, which removes the fund from the window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Savings Overview View

The "Savings Overview" displays the total amount saved, the overall targeted savings amount, and the percentage of the targeted amount achieved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This provides a clear summary of progress towards [[tracking_savings_and_contributions_with_notion | tracking savings and contributions]].

## Transactions Panel

The transactions panel, located at the bottom of the dashboard, is where individual savings contributions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This feature supports [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | tracking transactions and expenses]].

### Adding Transactions
Click "Add Transaction" to create a new entry, automatically pre-filled with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Transactions are organized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The date can be changed using a calendar pop-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Linking Transactions to Funds
When adding a transaction, you can enter a description (e.g., "saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Then, in the "Saving Fund" column, select the specific saving fund it contributes to (e.g., "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Enter the saving amount for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Automatic Updates
Once an amount is added in the transactions panel, it automatically populates and updates the total savings shown in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This dynamic update allows for real-time monitoring of progress towards savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Customization and Dynamic Features

### Currency Support
The savings tracker supports different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. By clicking on any amount, selecting "edit property," and then "number format," users can choose from various currencies supported by Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Grouping Transactions
The transaction view is dynamic and can be grouped by different timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. By default, transactions are grouped by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This can be changed to group by week or year by accessing the grouping options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This allows users to view their savings progress on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The entire template is customizable to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

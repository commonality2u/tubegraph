NotionBooks Freelancers OS is a comprehensive Notion dashboard designed for freelancers to manage their finances, including income and expense details, and to assist with client management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This system allows for detailed tracking of various aspects of a freelancing business, including clients, projects, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard has two main navigation windows:
*   **Finance Section**: This is where freelancers track their income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Instructions for changing currency and a quick tutorial for the finance setup are available here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Client Section**: This portal is dedicated to client management and related systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

It's recommended to classify any client-related income under "client" in the finance section so it reflects correctly in the client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Client Management

The client section provides four primary components:
*   Invoicing details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
*   Client details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
*   Project details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
*   Services section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>

Clients are categorized into pipelines: "Lead," "Negotiation," and "Client" (for current clients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. New clients can be added to any category, and their status can be changed by dragging and dropping them between categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

For each client, details such as company, contact information, email, position, stage, and website can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The invoice amount for a client is automatically pulled from the invoices linked to that client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Users can also input a contract value, and the system will calculate the percentage of the contract value that has been invoiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Project Tracking

Projects represent specific works performed to fulfill a work order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Projects can be categorized by priority: Low, Medium, and High <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

To add a new project:
1.  Click "New" under the desired priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
2.  Specify the project name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
3.  Add a project value, which can be part of a larger client contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
4.  Assign a completion date, which can be a single date or a date range (start and end date) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
5.  Update the project status (e.g., "Not Started") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

Project completion percentage can be calculated in two ways:
*   **Hourly Basis**: Specify estimated hours, and the system calculates completion based on actual hours booked against the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. For example, 7 actual hours out of 10 estimated hours results in 70% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Invoicing Basis**: Based on the total project value and the amount invoiced for that project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. For instance, if a project has a total value of $6,000 and $3,000 has been invoiced, the project is 50% completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## Services Tracking

Services are detailed offerings provided for each project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. The relationship follows a chain: one client can have multiple projects, and one project can have multiple services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Services are categorized by their status: "Not Started," "In Progress," or "Completed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

To add a new service:
1.  Click "New" under the relevant status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
2.  Specify the service name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
3.  Add service pricing, which can be "Hourly Basis" (e.g., $10 per hour) or a "Fixed Flat Rate" (e.g., $2,000 for the service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. These options can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
4.  Specify the expected service duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
5.  Assign the service to a specific client and project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## Invoicing and Workflow

The invoicing section tracks invoices based on their status: "Draft," "Sent," or "Paid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. The total invoice amount for each category is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

The "Workflow" section at the bottom is crucial as it aggregates all income details from the finance section that are classified under "client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. For each income entry, users can link:
*   The relevant invoice (either an existing one or create a new one directly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   The corresponding client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
*   The specific project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   The service provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

Filling these details in the workflow automatically updates the information in the respective client, project, and service sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Users can also mark invoices as "Paid" in the workflow, which helps with banking calculations in the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

## Other Tools

Beyond core tracking, the Freelancers OS includes:
*   **Resources**: A section to store useful information (checklists, guides, strategies, tips) related to various business aspects like taxes, [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeting]], [[using_notion_for_investment_tracking | investments]], and [[setting_up_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
*   **Contacts**: A catalog to store contact details of people regularly interacted with, categorized by service type (e.g., Finance, Legal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
*   **Goals**: A section to track personal or business goals, categorized by areas like Health, Wealth, and Relationship. Goal completion is calculated based on a target number and progress achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.
*   **Calendar**: Displays all scheduled meetings for the month, allowing users to add meeting titles, agendas, assign clients or contacts, specify meeting mediums, and attach reference documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.

The template is continuously updated, with future plans to add features for businesses handling inventory, supplies, and vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

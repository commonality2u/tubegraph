This article explains how to utilize a template's transaction sections to track tax payments and liabilities. The template is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of your tax situation, with sections for a summary, financials, quarterly taxes, and detailed transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

At the top of the template, a tax payment summary displays key information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Accounts

The "Accounts" section is where you set up your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources**: These are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples include "Services" and "Goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources**: These allow for availing input tax credit to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example is "Purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

You can add new revenue or expense sources using quick action buttons, which automatically update the account count display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Financials

The "Financials" section allows you to [[tracking_tax_liabilities_and_input_taxes | track]] your revenue and expense amounts, along with the corresponding tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For instance, $2000 of total revenue from services might have a total tax payable of $200 (a 10% tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Similarly, purchases might generate an input tax of $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. All these figures are automatically updated once details are entered in the [[using_the_transactions_tab_for_income_and_expenses | transactions]] view at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes

This section reflects all tax payments due for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. It displays taxes payable, input tax, and tax liability for each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Figures are updated based on transactions booked for specific quarters; for example, if all transactions are booked for Quarter 3, only that quarter will show updated figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section, located at the bottom of the template, is where detailed revenue and expense entries are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. It should be utilized after setting up your revenue and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Transactions are categorized into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Adding Revenue Transactions

To add a revenue transaction:
1.  Click the "Add Revenue" button, which creates a new line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
2.  Select the relevant period (e.g., Quarter 3 for September) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Choose the appropriate revenue account (e.g., "Goods") from the list of accounts you set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
4.  Enter the transaction amount (e.g., $1000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  Specify the tax rate (e.g., 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The tax payable will automatically calculate (e.g., $80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Once entered, the quarterly taxes and summary sections at the top will automatically update to reflect the new figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions

Adding an expense transaction follows a similar process:
1.  Click "Add Expense," which adds a new line item for the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  Fill in details such as the quarter (e.g., Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
3.  Select the expense account (e.g., "Purchases") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
4.  Input the amount (e.g., $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Enter the tax rate (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The input tax credit will be automatically calculated (e.g., $50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

The summary sections will update to reflect the new input credit and overall tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Profit/Loss Section

The template also includes a profit/loss section, which displays the total revenue earned from all transactions, the total expenses booked, and the resulting total profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This provides an additional financial overview derived from the transaction data.

By [[utilizing_transaction_section_for_expense_booking | utilizing the transaction section]] effectively, users can [[tracking_transactions_and_tax_liabilities | track]] their tax payments and gain insights into their financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

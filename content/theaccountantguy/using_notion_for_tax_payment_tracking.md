The Notion template for tax payment tracking helps users monitor all their tax liabilities at a glance, featuring a quarterly tax payment section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

At the top of the template, a tax payment summary displays three key areas: Accounts, Financials, and Quarterly Taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Accounts

This section is where all revenue and expense sources are set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources**: These are sources where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples include "Services" and "Goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources**: These allow users to avail input tax credit to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example is "Purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

New revenue or expense sources can be added using quick action buttons on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Details for new sources can be fed in using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The numbers indicating the count of revenue and expense sources automatically update as items are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Financials

The Financials section allows users to track revenue amounts, expense amounts, tax liability, and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For instance, services might show $2,000 in total revenue and $200 in total tax payable, while purchases might have $10 in input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. All figures in this section automatically update based on entries in the transactions view at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This comprehensive tracking makes it a useful component of [[using_notion_for_financial_management | financial management]] and [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]].

### Quarterly Taxes

This view reflects all tax payments that need to be made for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For each quarter, it displays taxes payable, input tax, and tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The figures update based on transactions booked for that specific quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Transaction Section

After setting up revenue and expense sources, users can scroll down to the transaction section, which is classified into revenue and expense transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This part of the template is essential for [[how_to_track_income_and_expenses_using_notion | tracking income and expenses using Notion]].

### Adding Revenue

To add a revenue transaction:
1.  Click the "Add Revenue" button, which automatically adds a new line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
2.  Select the relevant period (e.g., Quarter 3 for September) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Choose the account (e.g., Goods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
4.  Input the amount (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  Enter the tax rate (e.g., 8%), and the tax payable (e.g., $80) will automatically display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
All these details will update the quarterly taxes summary at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Adding Expenses

To add an expense transaction, click the "Add Expense" button, which also adds a new expense line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The process for filling in details is similar to adding revenue: select the quarter, choose the account (e.g., Purchases), input the amount (e.g., $500), and enter the tax rate (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The input credit (e.g., $50) will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This functionality supports [[how_to_use_notion_for_tracking_business_expenses | tracking business expenses]] and [[using_notion_for_personal_and_business_expense_tracking | personal and business expense tracking]].

## Profit/Loss Section

The template also includes a profit/loss section, which provides an overview of:
*   Total revenue earned from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   Total expenses booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   The total profit made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

This feature complements other Notion finance tracking capabilities like [[using_notion_for_debt_tracking | debt tracking]], [[using_notion_for_bill_tracking | bill tracking]], [[using_notion_for_investment_tracking | investment tracking]], and [[tracking_invoice_payments_in_notion | tracking invoice payments]].

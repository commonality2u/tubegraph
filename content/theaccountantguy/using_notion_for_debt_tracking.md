This article demonstrates how to utilize a [[managing_debts_and_loans_with_notion | debt payment tracker]] in Notion to manage and pay off debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool is part of a broader [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_using_notion | personal finance tracking system]] in Notion, offering specific functionalities for [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]] and [[using_notion_for_bill_tracking | bill tracking]] related to debts.

## Debt Overview Section

The "Debt Overview" section divides debts into different categories, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Key details tracked for each debt include:
*   **Debt Details**: The name or description of the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Loan Amount**: The total original loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount**: The Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) amount for each payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: The specified interest rate for the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Initial Repayment**: The date of the first installment payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A calculated date indicating when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs**: The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Managing Debt Categories

Users can add new payment categories (e.g., "Weekly") by clicking the "add a group" button and specifying the new installment period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The system includes common payment schedules, such as annual, monthly, quarterly, and weekly repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Debts can be moved between different repayment schedules by dragging and dropping them into the desired category, which automatically updates their repayment schedules and other related calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Debt Details

*   **Adding New Debt**: A new debt can be quickly added by clicking the "add details" button, which places it under a "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Once added, it can be moved to the appropriate frequency, and details can be input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Debt**: To edit existing loan details, simply click on the debt field and type the desired changes; updates will reflect across all relevant columns and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress Section

This section provides a summary of all loans and their payoff status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It includes:
*   **Total Amount Repaid**: The sum of all installments paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This amount is automatically updated when any EMI for a loan is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage**: The percentage of the total debt that has been paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A quick reference to the projected debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Interest Amount**: The total interest paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Principal Amount Repaid**: The portion of payments that have gone towards reducing the principal debt amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

> Every amount paid towards debt repayment is split into interest and principal amounts, which are reported at the bottom of the section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. All progress metrics update automatically as payment details are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction Section" centralizes all debt payment records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Paid Installment Section

This part displays all paid debts, categorized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A quick summation shows the total EMIs paid for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

For each payment, the following details are available:
*   **Paid Status**: A toggle to mark if the amount has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Ticking this automatically updates the payment status in the paid/unpaid columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Payment Date**: The date the payment was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Loan Details**: A dropdown to select the specific loan associated with the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment**: The amount paid for that installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Next Repayment Schedule**: Automatically generated based on the debt's set payment frequency (e.g., if a student loan has monthly payments, a September 30 payment will show October 30 as the next payment date) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For annual loans, like a home loan, a payment on September 27, 2023, will generate a next repayment date of September 27, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

A "pay debt amount" button automatically adds a new debt payment entry to the schedule for the current date, allowing users to quickly input details and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

This detailed [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker in Notion | personal finance tracker]] provides a comprehensive overview and management tool for debts, similar to how Notion can be used for [[using_notion_for_tax_payment_tracking | tax payment tracking]] or [[using_notion_for_investment_tracking | investment tracking]].

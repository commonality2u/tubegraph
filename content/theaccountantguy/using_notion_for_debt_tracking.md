This article demonstrates how to utilize a debt payment tracker in Notion to pay off all debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tool helps with [[managing_debt_and_loans_in_notion | managing debt and loans]] by providing a comprehensive overview and tracking system.

## Debt Overview Section

The debt overview section categorizes debt and provides detailed information for each loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Columns

Each debt entry includes the following details:
*   **Debt details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **EMI amount**: The amount paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest rate**: User-specifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Initial repayment**: The first installment payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Debt free by**: A calculated date showing when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs**: Indicates how many installments are left for the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Categories

Debts are divided into different categories based on payment frequency, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Additional categories like weekly and quarterly repayments are also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Users can add new installment periods by clicking the "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Existing debts can be moved between different repayment schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress Section

This section provides a quick summary of the overall debt payoff status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
It reflects:
*   All current loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   The total amount repaid, which updates automatically from recorded installments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Net payoff in percentage, showing how much of the total debt has been paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   The estimated debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   The total interest amount paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   The total principal amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Transaction Section (Installments)

This section allows users to track all debt payments made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Paid Installment Section

This part reflects all paid debts, bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It provides a summation of all EMIs paid for each particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Payment Details

For each installment, users can record:
*   Whether the amount has been paid (ticking a box automatically updates the status from unpaid to paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   The payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   The specific loan details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   The EMI amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   The next repayment schedule, which automatically updates based on the set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, a student loan set for monthly payments will show the next payment one month later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, while an annual home loan will show the next payment a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Details

*   **Adding a new debt**: Click the "add details" button to quickly add a new debt, initially placed in the "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Once moved to a specific frequency, it updates accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Editing existing loan details**: Click on the debt field and type in changes, which automatically update across all relevant columns and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Adding a new debt payment**: Click the "pay debt amount" button to automatically add a new debt payment to the schedule, set to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

All updates to payments and debt details are reflected automatically in the debt payoff progress section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

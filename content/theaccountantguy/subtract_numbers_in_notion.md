This article details how to [[finding_differences_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference between two numbers]] in Notion using [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Two distinct [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] can be employed for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:

1.  The [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
2.  The minus sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Database Setup

To begin, you need to create a database in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This can be done by typing a forward slash (`/`) and then "database" to select from the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

The database should include:
*   A "Title" property, which serves to describe the operation being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Two distinct "Number" properties, which will hold the values between which you want to find the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Methods to Subtract Numbers

### Using the Subtract Operator

One way to [[finding_differences_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference between two numbers]] is by using the [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, if "Number 1" and "Number 2" are provided as inputs, the [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] will return their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Using the Minus Sign

Alternatively, you can use the minus sign (`-`) to [[finding_differences_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference between two numbers]] in your Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This method also directly calculates the difference between the specified numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

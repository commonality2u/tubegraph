This article outlines how a personal finance tracker spreadsheet can be utilized to track income and expenses and customize financial analysis within [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_google_sheets | Google Sheets]].

## Spreadsheet Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

The spreadsheet is composed of three main tabs:
*   **Start Here Tab:** Provides instructions for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Budget Tab:** Used for setting up income and expense accounts and their budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Transactions Tab:** Where individual income and expense transactions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Dashboard Tab:** Presents a comprehensive analysis of financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Financial Accounts (Budget Tab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

The first step in customizing your financial analysis is to define your accounts:
*   Navigate to the [[setting_up_a_monthly_budget_in_google_sheets | Budget tab]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Feed in details related to your income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Categorize each account as either income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   Specify budgeted amounts for each account across different months to set income goals or expense estimations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The "Goal Amount" column is formula-driven, totaling the monthly entries, and can be dragged down to new line items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   New rows can be added to the tab by selecting the desired number of rows and clicking "ADD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Recording Transactions (Transactions Tab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>

After setting up accounts in the [[setting_up_a_monthly_budget_in_google_sheets | Budget tab]], transactions can be added:
*   Input the date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Add details of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Select the relevant category for the transaction from the accounts defined earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   A formula-driven property in column E indicates whether it's an income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This property can be dragged down when adding new transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Specify the amount for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Customizing Financial Analysis with the Dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>

The [[managing_investments_with_a_google_sheets_dashboard | dashboard section]] allows for powerful [[using_dynamic_reporting_for_personal_finance_analysis | dynamic reporting]] and customization of financial analysis:
*   All analysis on the dashboard is controlled using filters for **category**, **period**, and **type of reference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Dashboard Sections and Filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

*   **Summary:** Displays total income, total expenses, and the net balance for the selected period and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For example, you can view a summary for the entire year 2023 across all accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Income Overview:** Shows different sources of income earned during the filtered period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Expenses Overview:** Provides a similar breakdown for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Monthly Personal Finance Overview:** Details income and expense per month, along with the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Status Callout:** Indicates whether expenses have exceeded the budget or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Practical Customization Examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>

Users can [[customizing_budget_views_and_filters | customize their view]] by applying filters:
*   To see the total income for an entire period (e.g., 2023) across all accounts, filter accordingly, and the dashboard updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   To view specific individual income sources, such as "Salary," simply change the category filter, and the entire dashboard view will adjust to show only "Salary" related amounts and details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

This filtering capability enables users to perform detailed analysis of their income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

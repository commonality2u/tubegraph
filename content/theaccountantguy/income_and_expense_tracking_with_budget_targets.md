This article provides an overview of a [[overview_of_budgeting_tracker_template | budgeting tracker]] template designed to fulfill various [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | budgeting requirements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It helps users manage their [[income_and_expense_management | income and expenses]] by setting targets and tracking actual amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Core Financial Components

The [[overview_of_budgeting_tracker_template | budgeting tracker]] is built around five main financial components:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

For each component, users can specify a targeted or [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budgeted amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Setting Budget and Goal Amounts

For income, a "goal amount" can be set for each income component on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Similarly, for expenses, a [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budget amount]] can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budget amounts]] can be specified at the start of each month for different sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Monitoring Progress Against Targets

As expenses are incurred or income is received, the tracker automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It shows the percentage of the [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budgeted amount]] that has been incurred as an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A "budget status" indicator reveals whether expenses have exceeded the [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budgeted amount]] or remained within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This principle applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. For income, it shows the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Detailed Tracking Views

### Overview by Category

The left side of the tracker provides an overview of all different elements for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Users can select a component from a dropdown (e.g., "income overview") to see all added income categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For each category, it displays the specific income/expense amount, the goal/[[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budget amount]] set, and the total percentage of the goal/budget achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Users can add as many categories as desired for each component, and the display will update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Monthly Summaries

At the bottom of the tracker, there's a monthly overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This section provides a month-wise division of the summary data seen at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. For example, in the expenses summary, it shows categories like food, entertainment, and shopping, broken down by month (e.g., Jan 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Adding entries for a new month will automatically show that month at the bottom and update the elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

### Quick Entry Buttons

To input transactions, users can scroll down to a section with quick buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Clicking an "income" or "expense" button automatically adds an entry to the respective window with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Transaction Details

When entering a transaction, the following details need to be added:
*   **Detail**: A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Date**: The specific date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Month**: The month in which the income or expense was made (e.g., January 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Users can type in their own month and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Year**: The year of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Category**: The specific category for the income or expense source (e.g., salary, side income, food, entertainment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Categories can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Code**: A source code for the income or expense category, used to collate data for different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount**: The [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budget amount]] set at the start of the month for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount**: The actual income or expense amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Currency Customization

The currency can be changed from dollars to any other preferred currency by editing the number format property for the number values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Dynamic Data Analysis

### Filtering Options

The tracker supports dynamic filtering for all data. Users can filter the entire dataset for a particular year (e.g., 2024) or a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This allows viewing values for a specific year, a specific month across all years, or a specific month for a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### [[managing_funds_and_balance_tracking | Funds Balance Tracking]]

The "funds balance" view shows the total income and total spendings for every month, along with the balance amount remaining at the end of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. When an income entry is made, it automatically updates this balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Spendings are derived from all expenses, debt payments, bills payments, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This provides a quick glance at the account balance at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> and can also be dynamically filtered by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

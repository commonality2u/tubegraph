This article demonstrates how to utilize a [[payments_tracker | debt payment tracker]] to pay off all your debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The tracker is designed to provide a comprehensive overview and detailed tracking of your debt repayment journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Debt Overview Section

The "Debt Overview" section categorizes debts by payment frequency, such as annual or monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Key details included for each debt are:
*   **Debt Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **EMI Amount:** The amount paid per installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Initial Repayment:** The first installment payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By:** A calculated date indicating when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs:** The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Managing Debt Categories

Users can add new payment categories (e.g., "weekly") by clicking the "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Existing debts can be moved between repayment schedules (e.g., to quarterly or weekly) by dragging the debt item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, which automatically updates the repayment schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

To quickly add a new debt, click the "added details" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The new debt will initially appear under a "no payment frequency" column until it is moved to a specific frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Existing loan details can be edited by clicking on the debt field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress

The "Debt Payoff Progress" section provides an integrated summary of all loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>:
*   **Total Amount Repaid:** This amount automatically updates based on the installments recorded in the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage:** Shows the percentage of the total debt that has been paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By:** A quick reference to the projected debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Interest Amount:** The total interest paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Principal Amount:** The total principal amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

All amounts paid towards debt are split into interest and principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This summary automatically updates as payment details are added or changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction Section" is where all debt payments are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Paid Installment Section

This section reflects all debts that have been paid, organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It includes a summation of all EMIs paid for that particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Columns in this section include:
*   **Payment Status:** A checkbox to mark if the amount has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Ticking this automatically updates the status (e.g., moving from unpaid to paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Payment Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   **Loan Details:** Allows selection of a specific loan added earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
*   **Next Repayment Schedule:** Automatically calculated based on the loan's set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, if a student loan has monthly payments and a payment is made on September 30, the next payment will be scheduled for October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Similarly, an annual home loan paid on September 27, 2023, will have its next repayment scheduled for September 27, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

To add a new debt payment to the schedule, click the "pay debt amount" button, which automatically adds a new entry based on the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Users can then fill in the details and add a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

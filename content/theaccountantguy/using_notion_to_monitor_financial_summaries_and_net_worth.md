A small business bookkeeping template in [[using_notion_for_financial_management | Notion]] helps track all bookkeeping needs for a small business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This template is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of a business's financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Template Structure

The template is divided into three main sections:
1.  **Start Here Section**: Used for initial setup and defining accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  **Summary Section**: Displays a summary of all entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
3.  **Transactions Window**: Where all transaction details related to the business are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Start Here Section

This section is for entering initial and related information for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Accounts Setup

The account section categorizes finances into:
*   **Expenses**: Examples include purchase expense, utility bills, subscription, and salaries/wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Liabilities**: Includes accounts payable, taxes payable, accrued expenses, and credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **Assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

Users can edit existing items by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> or delete items by selecting the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:24]</a>. New items can be added to their respective categories by clicking "new page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:37]</a>.

For every added item, users can specify:
*   **Opening Balance**: For carried-forward liabilities and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Options include bills, debt, or savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:59]</a>. For expenses, classifications like "bills" for utility bills and "subscription" for subscriptions are pre-added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: For recurring payments (e.g., monthly, half-yearly, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**: For starting inventory or assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Asset Class**: Can be classified as "inventory" or "investment" <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Transactions Window

This section allows for entering detailed transactions for income, expense, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:08]</a>. Clicking "add income" automatically adds an income entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:17]</a>.

Key transaction fields include:

*   **Amount**: The monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Document**: An option to attach relevant documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Workflow for Monitoring

To [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | set up a personal finance tracker in Notion]] for a small business:
1.  Start by setting up different accounts under various heads (expenses, liabilities, income, assets) in the "Start Here" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  Add relevant opening balances for assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:10]</a>.
3.  Continuously enter details for every business transaction in the "Transactions Window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:15]</a>.

This process automatically updates all summary sections, allowing users to view entire business finances at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:21]</a>. The [[databases_required_for_tracking_net_worth_in_notion | databases required for tracking net worth in Notion]] are implicitly built into this template structure.

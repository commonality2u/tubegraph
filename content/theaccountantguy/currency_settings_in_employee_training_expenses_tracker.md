All currencies within the tracker can be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## General Currency Customization

To change a specific currency, you can access the currency settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This feature is part of the overall [[customizing_a_business_expense_tracker_in_notion | customization]] available within the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Changing Currency in Specific Views

When viewing data in a table format, such as the training expenses section, you can modify the currency display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>:
*   Switch the view to "table view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   Click on this setting to choose any currency of your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Changing Currency in Dashboard Overview

*   Click on any of the numerical information displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   The currency, such as a dollar sign, is embedded within the formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   This aspect is fully [[converting_currency_and_custom_templates_for_invoices | customizable]] to suit specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

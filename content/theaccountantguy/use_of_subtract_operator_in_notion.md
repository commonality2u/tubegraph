The subtract operator in Notion is a formulaic method used to [[finding_difference_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference between two numbers]] within a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This operator is one of two primary formulas for this purpose, the other being the [[using_minus_sign_to_find_difference_in_notion | minus sign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Notion Database

To utilize the subtract operator, you must first set up a database in Notion:
1.  Create a new database by typing a forward slash `/` and selecting "database" from the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  The first property in the database is typically the title property, indicating the purpose of the entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  Assign number properties to at least two different columns within your database. These will be the numbers between which you want to [[finding_difference_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Applying the Subtract Operator

After setting up your database with number properties, you can add a formula property to calculate the difference:
*   The subtract operator is used within a formula property to [[finding_difference_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference between two numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   This operator requires two numbers as input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It then calculates and returns the [[finding_difference_between_numbers_in_notion | difference between them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   For example, if you have "Number 1" and "Number 2" as inputs, the subtract operator will output the [[finding_difference_between_numbers_in_notion | difference between both]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Alternative Method

In addition to the subtract operator, you can also use the [[using_minus_sign_to_find_difference_in_notion | minus sign]] (`-`) in a formula to [[finding_difference_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference between two numbers]] in a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

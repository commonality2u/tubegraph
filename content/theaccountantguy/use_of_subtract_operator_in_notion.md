When working with databases in Notion, you can find the [[finding_differences_between_numbers_in_notion | difference between two numbers]] using formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Two primary methods involve the [[subtract_numbers_in_notion | subtract operator]] and the [[finding_differences_between_numbers_in_notion | minus sign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Database Setup
To begin, you need to create a database in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This can be done by typing a forward slash (`/`) and then "database" to select from the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

Within this database, ensure the following properties are set up:
*   A `Title` property, which indicates the purpose of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Two distinct `Number` properties to hold the values between which you want to find the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Using the Subtract Operator
One way to calculate the difference is by employing the [[subtract_numbers_in_notion | subtract operator]] within a formula property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
The [[subtract_numbers_in_notion | subtract operator]] is designed to take two numbers as input and then calculate their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, if you have "Number 1" and "Number 2" as your input properties, the formula using the [[subtract_numbers_in_notion | subtract operator]] will yield their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Using the Minus Sign
Alternatively, you can achieve the same result by using the [[finding_differences_between_numbers_in_notion | minus sign]] (`-`) directly in your formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This method also allows you to [[finding_differences_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference between both numbers]] given in your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Both the [[subtract_numbers_in_notion | subtract operator]] and the [[finding_differences_between_numbers_in_notion | minus sign]] provide effective ways to [[finding_differences_between_numbers_in_notion | find the difference between two numbers]] in a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

The Subscription Expenses Tracker allows users to [[handling_subscriptions_and_recurring_payments_in_notion | track all subscription expenses]] and easily edit various details, including billing periods and transaction information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Subscription Overview and Categories
The "Subscription Overview" section provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Subscriptions are organized under "Active" and "Cancel" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Each entry shows the subscription name, total expenses incurred, and the billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Editing Billing Periods
To change a subscription's billing period, simply click on the existing period, and a list of options will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While it's possible to change the name of a billing period, it is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. You can select any preferred billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Managing Subscription Groups
The "Expenses" section divides subscriptions into different classifications, such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Groups
*   **Add a New Group**: Click the plus (+) icon to [[adding_and_organizing_new_subscription_groups | add a new subscription group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Edit Existing Groups**: To edit an existing group, click on it and change its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Underneath each classification, you'll see the subscription name, total expenses, and the percentage each subscription contributes to the overall expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Quick Actions for Subscriptions
A "quick action" button allows you to "add subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. When clicked, it automatically adds a new subscription under a "note" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   You can move this new subscription to any desired classification by clicking on the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   To edit the full details of this quick-added subscription, click the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Transaction Section for Detailed Editing
The "Transaction section" is where you [[tracking_and_updating_subscription_transactions | feed all details and book expenses]] for subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This section provides views for both "Active subscriptions" and "Cancel subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with newer months appearing at the top, and includes the total sum of expenses for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Editing Transaction Details
Within the transaction section, you can input or modify various details:
*   **Status**: A checkbox indicates if a subscription is currently active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Checking this box means the subscription is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Subscription Account**: You can select the specific subscription account from a list populated by all subscriptions added previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Billing Period**: This value is automatically pulled from what was set in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Payment Date**: Choose any date for the subscription payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Amount**: Enter the amount of the subscription expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Renewal Date**: The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the payment date and the set billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, a monthly Netflix subscription paid on September 30th will show October 30th as the next renewal date, calculated as 30 days or a month from the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This applies to annual and weekly subscriptions as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Cancelling Subscriptions
To cancel a subscription, simply click the checkbox next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This action automatically changes its [[managing_subscription_categories_and_statuses | status to "canceled"]], and it will be reflected in the "Cancel subscription" view and the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Customizing Currency
The tracker also allows you to change the currency displayed in the dashboard to suit your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

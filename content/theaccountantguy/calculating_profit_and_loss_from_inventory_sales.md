The inventory tracking template includes a transaction section that simplifies the process of calculating profit and loss for inventory sales and purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This feature is integrated within the broader [[tracking_investments_and_inventory_values | inventory portfolio]] and [[tracking_inventory_status_and_transactions | inventory status]] views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Profit and Loss Calculation

To [[profit_and_loss_reporting_in_notion | calculate profit and loss]] for any sale, you must input the purchase price associated with that specific sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

For example, if bread is sold for $40, and its manufacturing cost was $10, you would enter $10 as the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The template then automatically calculates the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

If you made purchases of different [[setting_up_inventory_categories | raw materials]] to create a [[managing_inventory_categories_and_subcategories | finished good]] like bread, you would evaluate the total cost of these finished goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Alternatively, if you purchased the finished product directly, you would enter its purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Example Calculation

A sale of bread for $40 with a cost of $10 per unit yields a $30 profit per unit ($40 - $10 = $30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. If 30 units were sold, the total profit would be $900 ($30 x 30 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

This functionality helps users to [[calculating_profit_and_loss_in_notion | calculate profit and loss in Notion]] and provides insights into [[income_and_expense_management | income and expense management]] relating to inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The template also supports [[customizing_templates_and_calculating_sales_data | customizing templates and calculating sales data]] through automated population of values based on entered prices and units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

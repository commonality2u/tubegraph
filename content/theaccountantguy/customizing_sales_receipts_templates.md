This article explores how to utilize and customize sales receipts templates, focusing on a dedicated tracker template and a tool for generating PDF documents for sales receipts.

## Sales Receipts Tracker Template

The sales receipts tracker template is designed to help keep track of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It features a [[setting_up_a_sales_receipts_database | sales receipts database]] that contains essential information for tracking sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Database Fields
The database includes the following fields:
*   Receipt number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Receipt date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Payment method (with several options) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Name of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Business address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Customer details (a relational property linked to another database with client information) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Description of items sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Quantity of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   Unit price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

For each sales record, multiple descriptions, quantities, and unit prices can be added per row for different items sold within a single sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. These are summed up in the subtotal column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The template also includes a tax rate and computes the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, along with a notes column for relevant payment information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Sales Receipt Summary
The template provides a sales receipt summary at the top, displaying the total sales made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> and the total units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   If additional columns are added for descriptions and quantities, the formulas for the subtotal and total amount need to be updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   The quantity sold column also needs to be updated if more quantities are added for corresponding descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   The average sales value is calculated as total sales divided by units sold, providing key performance indicator (KPI) information for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Client Summary
A client summary section shows total sales for each client, the total quantity of sales made to each client, and the average sales price per client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This section can be [[customizing_and_filtering_sales_data | customized]] as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## PDF Output for Generating Sales Receipts

A tool called PDF output.com can be used to generate [[using_templates_in_pdf_output_for_generating_receipts | sales receipts PDF documents]] for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

    *   New rows can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, and individual rows or items can be deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
2.  Click "Download all PDF" to download all the generated PDFs in one go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

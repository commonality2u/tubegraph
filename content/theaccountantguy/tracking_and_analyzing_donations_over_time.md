This article outlines how to utilize a charity donation tracker to organize and analyze contributions to various charities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The tracker is structured into three main sections: fund setup, donations overview, and summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The initial step involves setting up donation categories and individual funds within those categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Categories
Donations are initially divided into default categories such as Health, Environment, and Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These existing categories can be edited or new ones can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Individual Funds
Under each category, specific funds can be set up, such as American Red Cross, WHO, and Care funds under Health; Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, and The Rainforest Foundation under Environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

To add a new fund, click the "add funds" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. New funds are initially unclassified and can be moved to an existing category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Once placed, details can be edited by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Key details to add for each fund include:
*   **Name of the fund** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   **Opening Balance:** The amount of donations made to this fund at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted Donation:** The desired donation amount for the specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Start Date:** When you began donating to this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Target Date:** The end goal date by which you aim to reach the targeted donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Funds can also be deleted by clicking the three-dot icon and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Recent Donations

This section records individual donations and provides a monthly breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. More recent months appear at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

For each donation, you can enter:
*   **Date:** When the donation was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Period:** The month and year of the donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. New periods can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Fund:** Select the specific fund from those set up previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Recommended Amount:** A calculated figure showing how much needs to be contributed monthly from the start date to reach the targeted amount by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This helps estimate the required monthly contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Amount:** The actual donation amount made for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Status Indicator:**
    *   A checkmark indicates that the actual contribution exceeded the recommended requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   A crossmark indicates the donation falls short of the requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

New donation entries can be added automatically with the current date by clicking the "add donation" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview

This section presents a quarterly breakdown of all donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Each quarter includes the months within it (e.g., Q1: January, February, March) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

For each month within a quarter, you can see:
*   **Total Donations Made** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Total Donation Requirement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Requirement Met** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Color-coded status:**
    *   **Red:** Donation is falling short of the requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
    *   **Green:** Enough donations have been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   **Blue:** Total donation equals the donation requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

The top of the quarterly overview also displays a calculated total donation amount for all combined months within that quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. All figures automatically update as more funds are added to the donations page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

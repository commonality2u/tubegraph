[[managing_finances_with_notion | Managing finances with Notion]] is streamlined with a dedicated Investment Portfolio tracker, which allows users to track all their investments and monitor profits and losses with ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This system features sections for the overall portfolio, individual investments, and detailed transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Investment Portfolio Overview

The tracker provides a clear view of an individual's investment performance:

*   **Portfolio Section**: This section displays the investment value and available units at the end of a financial year or after all transactions are completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. It also indicates the investment percentage, showing each investment's proportion of the total portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss Section**: Integrated within the portfolio view, this section summarizes the total profit and loss for each investment category, such as stocks and cryptos, after all transactions are accounted for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. A total summation of profit or loss is available for each section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions for Profit/Loss

The core of [[utilizing_the_transaction_and_profit_loss_sections_in_notion | tracking transactions and profit/loss]] lies in the detailed transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>:

*   **All Transactions View**: This view lists all buy and sell activities. For each transaction, users input the date, description, transaction type (buy/sell), the specific investment account (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin), the number of units, and the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. The amount is automatically calculated by multiplying units by price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Buy and Sell Views**: Separate views for "buy" and "sell" transactions allow for focused input. When buying, the system calculates the buy amount automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss from Transactions**: The dedicated profit and loss section within the transactions view allows users to see the profit or loss generated by each individual transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. By inputting the buy price for a sold investment, the system reflects the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### Profit/Loss Calculation Example

If 30 units of Apple stock were sold for $40 each, resulting in a sales value of $1,200, and the initial buy price was $10 per unit, the profit is calculated as the difference between the sell and buy price multiplied by the units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. In this example, ($40 - $10) \* 30 units = $900 profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Streamlining Data Entry

Quick action buttons facilitate efficient data entry:

*   **Add Investment**: This button quickly adds a new investment entry, allowing users to specify details like opening balance, opening units, and assign it to categories like stocks or crypto, or create new categories such as "bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Buy Investment**: Clicking this button automatically creates a new line item in the "buy" view, pre-filled with the current date, ready for users to add transaction details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Sell Investment**: Similarly, this button generates a new entry in the "sell" view, allowing for quick input of selling information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

This comprehensive approach allows users to [[tracking_income_expenses_assets_and_liabilities_in_notion | track income, expenses, assets, and liabilities in Notion]], specifically focusing on investments, and gain a clear understanding of their financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

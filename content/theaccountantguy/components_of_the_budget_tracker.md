This article provides an overview of the key components and features within the [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | Notion Budget Tracker Template]], designed to help fulfill budgeting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Core Components
The [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | budgeting tracker]] is built around five main components: Income, Expense, Debt, Bills, and Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For each component, users can specify a targeted or budgeted amount:
*   **Income**: Set a goal amount for each income component for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Expense**: Set a budget amount, which automatically updates as expenses are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Debt, Bills, Savings**: Similar to expenses, targeted amounts can be set for these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

For all components, the tracker displays the percentage of the budgeted amount incurred or achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Additionally, a "budget status" indicates whether spending has exceeded the budgeted amount or remained within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Overview Sections
On the left side of the tracker, an overview section provides detailed insights for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. A drop-down menu allows users to select specific components (Income, Expense, Debt, Bills, Savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

For each selected component, the overview shows:
*   Specific income or expense amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   Goal or targeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   Total percentage of the goal achieved or budget incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
This overview is a cumulative display across all months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Below the main overview, a [[monthly_budget_tracking | monthly overview]] provides a month-wise summary for each category and element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Users can add as many categories as needed for each component, and these will automatically update in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Transaction Entry
Transactions are [[entering_and_tracking_transactions_in_notion_budget_planner | entered]] into the tracker using [[using_quick_action_buttons_in_a_budget_tracker | quick action buttons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:14]</a>. Clicking an "Income" or "Expense" button automatically adds a new entry to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:24]</a>.

For each transaction, the following details are entered:
*   **Detail**: A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Date**: The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Month**: The month of the transaction, which can be typed in (e.g., "Jan 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Year**: The year of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Category**: The specific category for the income or expense (e.g., Salary, Side Hustle, Food, Entertainment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:03:00]</a>. Categories can be edited or new ones created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Code**: A unique identifier for the source of the income or expense, often combining the category and month/year for easy tracking across periods (e.g., "Food Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount**: The amount budgeted for that specific category at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount**: The actual income or expense amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Monthly Summaries and Dynamic Filtering
The [[monthly_budget_tracking | month-wise summary]] at the bottom of the tracker updates automatically as transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:44]</a>. When new months or categories are added, they dynamically appear in the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:03]</a>.

The summary sections can be dynamically filtered by year or month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:22]</a>. Users can add filters to view data for:
*   A particular year (e.g., 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   A specific month (e.g., January) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:41]</a>.
This allows for focused analysis of [[monthly_budget_tracking | monthly budget performance]] or annual trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Funds Balance
The "Funds Balance" view provides a quick glance at the financial position at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:32]</a>. It shows:
*   Total income for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   Total spending (derived from expenses, debt payments, bills, and savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   The remaining balance amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:32]</a>.
This view also supports dynamic filtering by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Customization
Users can [[customizing_budget_tracking_templates | customize]] the template to fit their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:14]</a>. This includes:
*   Adding new income or expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   Changing the currency for numerical values from dollars to other options available in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:15]</a>.

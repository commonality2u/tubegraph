The Employee Schedule Template is designed to help organizations keep track of their employees' schedules and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06"></a>. It offers different views to monitor work hours, leave, and overall performance.

## Key Views for Performance Tracking

The template features dedicated sections for monitoring employee hours and performance:

### 1. Task Schedule

Before performance can be tracked, employees enter their daily task information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08"></a>. This includes:
*   **Shifts**: Tasks are divided by shift (e.g., first, second, third) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50"></a>.
*   **Time Details**: Start and end times for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59"></a>.
*   **Task Details**: Specific information about the task being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10"></a>.
*   **Employee Linkage**: Tasks are assigned to specific employees who have been added in the employee details section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15"></a>.
*   **Attendance**: Employees can mark their attendance as "present," "on leave," or "day off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40"></a>.
*   **Task Status**: The status of a task can be updated (e.g., "in progress," "completed," "not started," or "not applicable" for days off/leave) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48"></a>.
*   **Auto-Computation**: The template automatically calculates the hours an employee has worked on a specific task based on the entered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33"></a>.

### 2. Monthly View

The Monthly View provides a summarized overview of employee hours and leave for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19"></a>. It breaks down the year into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25"></a>. For each month, this view displays:
*   **Total Hours Worked**: The total hours employees have worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29"></a>.
*   **Total Hours on Leave**: The total hours employees have been on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30"></a>.
*   **Total Hours (Overall)**: A summation of both working hours and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33"></a>.

This view offers a quick overview of monthly performance and overall employee engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38"></a>.

### 3. Employee Performance

For a more granular look, the Employee Performance section allows users to examine the same data on an individual employee basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45"></a>. Here, for every employee, you can see:
*   **Hours Worked**: The hours an individual employee has worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57"></a>.
*   **Hours on Leave**: The hours an individual employee has been on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59"></a>.
*   **Total Hours (Combined)**: The combined total of their worked and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00"></a>.

This view helps in understanding individual contributions and attendance patterns.

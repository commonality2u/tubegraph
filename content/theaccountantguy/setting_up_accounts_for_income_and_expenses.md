To effectively [[tracking_finances_expenses_and_investments | track personal finances]] using the Notion setup, the initial step involves [[how_to_set_up_accounts_using_a_cash_flow_template | setting up accounts]] for income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>. This setup is part of a larger tracker that includes sections for net worth targets, a summary, debt, budget, savings, bills, subscriptions, and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18"></a>.

## Navigating to the Account Section

The process begins by navigating to the **Account section** located under the "get started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36"></a>. This section displays all income and expenses relevant to your personal finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40"></a>.

## Examples of Account Types

Common examples of accounts include:
*   **Income**: Salary, Side Hustle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46"></a>
*   **Expenses**: Groceries, Utility Bills, Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51"></a>

## Adding and Modifying Accounts

### Modifying Existing Accounts
To modify an existing income or expense account, simply click on the "edit" button associated with that account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55"></a>. This action will open a modification panel where you can make changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00"></a>.

### Adding New Accounts
To add a new income or expense account, click on the "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12"></a>. This will open a new account setup panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15"></a>.

### Setting Up New Account Details
When [[setting_up_revenue_and_expense_accounts_in_notion | setting up revenue and expense accounts in Notion]], you will need to input several details:
1.  **Account Name**: Type the name of the new account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10"></a>.
2.  **Opening Balance**: For income and expense accounts, the opening balance can generally be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14"></a>.
3.  **Classification**: [[setting_up_business_expense_categories | Expenses]] can be classified according to specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31"></a>. Common classifications include:
    *   Bills (e.g., Groceries, Utility Bills) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37"></a>
    *   Subscriptions (e.g., Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42"></a>
    *   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31"></a>
    *   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31"></a>
    Users can [[setting_up_expense_categories_and_budgets | classify expenses]] as per their own needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28"></a>.
4.  **Payment Frequency**: Set how frequently a payment is expected for the account (e.g., Monthly, Annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46"></a>. For instance, utility bills might be set to a monthly frequency, while some subscriptions could be annual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51"></a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00"></a>.

Once accounts are set up, the next step is to head over to the transactions view to start [[adding_transactions_to_track_income_and_expenses | adding transactions to track income and expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51"></a>.

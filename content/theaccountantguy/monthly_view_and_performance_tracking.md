The employee schedule template in Notion provides dedicated views for tracking employee performance, including a monthly overview and individual employee performance breakdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Monthly View

The Monthly View displays information for all months, which are divided into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This view helps in understanding the overall performance during the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

It provides the following key metrics for each month:
*   Total hours worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Total hours on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Total hours, which is the summation of working hours and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>

This view offers a quick overview of performance and how employees have performed in totality during the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Employee Performance

For a more granular look, the Employee Performance section displays the same information as the Monthly View but is broken down by individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This allows for individual employee performance tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

For each employee, the Employee Performance view shows:
*   Hours worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Hours on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
*   Total hours in totality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

The data for these views is automatically computed based on the information entered in the [[employee_schedule_template#Task Schedule|Task Schedule]] section of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

This template is customizable to fit specific organizational needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

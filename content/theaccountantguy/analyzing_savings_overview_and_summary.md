This article outlines how to effectively analyze your savings overview and summary within the template, providing insight into your emergency funds and financial progress.

## Overview of Savings and Summary Sections

The template includes a comprehensive summary section at the top, which displays three key components:
*   Fund Setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

The main summary section reflects all savings made and necessary contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The savings overview provides a glance at all savings accumulated to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Fund Setup and Categorization

Emergency funds are organized into categories, such as "Financial Safety," "Asset Protection," and "Health and Wellness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. These categories are customizable, allowing you to edit existing ones or add new groups as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

For each fund, you can define:
*   **Fund Detail:** A description of the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance:** An initial amount for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount:** The targeted savings amount for the emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Start Date:** When you begin contributing to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Target End Date:** The desired completion date for the fund goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

These settings automatically calculate the savings made to date for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## [[tracking_savings_and_net_worth | Savings Overview Details]]

The [[tracking_savings_and_net_worth | savings overview]] section organizes funds by their classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. For each emergency fund, specific line items provide a detailed view of its progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>:

*   **Total Savings:** This figure represents the sum of the fund's starting balance and all contributions made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. For example, a "Job Loss Fund" with a starting balance of $500 and contributions of $900 would show total savings of $1,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings:** This amount is directly pulled from the "Goal Amount" set in the fund setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved:** This metric shows the percentage of the total savings requirement that has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings Date:** The end goal date for the fund, as set during the fund setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Months Left:** The number of months remaining from the current date until the targeted end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This value updates automatically daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Contribution Required Per Month:** This indicates the monthly contribution needed to reach the targeted fund goal by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Overall Summary Analysis

At the top of the template, the summary section provides a high-level financial snapshot of all your emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>:

*   **Total Savings Made So Far:** This is the combined total of the opening balances of all your funds plus all contributions made across all entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Savings Required:** This represents the summation of all targeted savings amounts you have set for your various funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Difference:** The calculation of "Total Savings" minus "Savings Required" indicates your net progress towards your overall savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage:** This crucial metric shows how much of the targeted savings amount has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. For instance, if total savings are $10,350 and targeted savings are $40,000, it would show 26% achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

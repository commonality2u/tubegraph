He has developed a specific Notion template for [[tracking_net_worth_with_notion | tracking net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Overview of the Net Worth Tracker

The Notion net worth tracker is divided into three main sections to help calculate net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:
1.  **Get Started Section**: Used to specify your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  **Account Section**: Where you can specify all different accounts for personal finances, categorized into expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section**: Provides an overview of finances, displaying account closing balances and their proportion, and calculates net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   This section includes a "Net Worth" view which shows the net worth goal, total calculated net worth, the difference between the two, total growth, and percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   A "Transactions" view allows input of income, expenses, assets, and liabilities details to aid net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Setting Up the Tracker

### Get Started Section
To begin, set your net worth goal in the "Get Started" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. For example, you can set a goal of $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Changing this value automatically updates the entire database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Account Section
The "Account" section displays default accounts and allows for new additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Adding Accounts**: Click the "New" button under the relevant category (Income, Expenses, Assets, Liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   **Account Name**: For example, "Interest Income" for a new income account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    *   **Opening Balance**: Applicable for assets and liabilities, representing the value at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Income and expenses typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Classification (Tags)**: Assign tags like "other income" for interest income, "bills" for groceries, or "subscription" for Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. You can add custom categories or use existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   **Payment Frequency**: Specify how often payments are received or made (e.g., monthly for salary, quarterly for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Custom frequencies can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   **Opening Units & Asset Class**: These fields are primarily for [[setting_up_an_investment_portfolio_tracker_in_notion | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. For example, Bitcoin as an investment might have an opening balance of $100 and 10 opening units, classified under "crypto" and "Investments" as the asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. For other accounts, this field can be left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Savings can be classified as "savings" (e.g., car fund, education fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Liabilities like debt payments and loans can also be added with set payment frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Editing Accounts**: Click the pencil icon next to an existing account to open an edit window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
This section is fully customizable, and values can be edited at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Transaction Section
This section is crucial for [[tracking_income_expenses_assets_and_liabilities_in_notion | tracking income, expenses, assets, and liabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. It has four main views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities, plus an "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Transactions are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

*   **Adding a New Transaction**: Click "New" to populate fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
    *   **Date**: Select the transaction date; it automatically classifies into different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   **Description**: Add a description, e.g., "Salary Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   **Category**: This is automatically set (e.g., "income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   **Account**: Select the relevant account created earlier (e.g., "Salary account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   **Payment Mode**: How money is received or paid (e.g., "bank account" for income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   **Transaction Type**: Either "inflow" (money coming in, like income or new loan) or "outflow" (money going out, like expenses or loan repayment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: Specify the transaction amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
    *   **Document**: Attach any receipts or bills related to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Summary Section and Net Worth Calculation

After inputting accounts and transactions, the "Summary" section provides an overview and calculates net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Finances View
This view shows all expenses, income, assets, and liabilities as of the current date, along with the proportion each account contributes to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Net Worth View
This view displays five key statistical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>:
1.  **Net Worth Goal**: The target goal set in the "Get Started" section (e.g., $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This value can be changed directly within this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
2.  **Total Net Worth**: Calculated as total assets minus total liabilities (e.g., $6950 assets less $1600 liabilities equals $5350) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
3.  **Difference**: The difference between the Net Worth Goal and the Total Net Worth (e.g., $12,000 goal less $5350 net worth equals $6650 difference) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
4.  **Total Growth**: The closing net worth value minus the opening net worth value (derived from opening balances of assets and liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. For example, if opening net worth was $1000 and closing net worth is $5350, the growth is $4350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
5.  **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows what percentage of the net worth goal has been accomplished (e.g., $5350 net worth divided by $12,000 goal equals 45%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

As transactions are added, the net worth figures automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

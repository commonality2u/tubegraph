This article explains how to use a Notion template designed by Sanat Biswal, "The Accountant Guy," to [[utilizing_notion_to_monitor_net_worth_and_financial_goals | track your net worth]] and manage [[tracking_personal_finances_using_notion | personal finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The template is available for individuals, freelancers, and small business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Overview of the Net Worth Tracker

The [[building_a_net_worth_tracker_using_notion | net worth tracker]] in Notion is divided into three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:

1.  **Get Started Section**
    *   Used to specify your [[utilizing_notion_to_monitor_net_worth_and_financial_goals | net worth goal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  **Account Section**
    *   Allows you to specify all different accounts for your [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | personal finances]], categorized as [[using_notion_for_tracking_expenses | expenses]], [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | income]], assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section**
    *   Provides an overview of your entire finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   Displays all added accounts with their corresponding closing balances and proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   Features a dedicated "Net Worth" sub-section showing the net worth goal, total net worth calculation, the difference between the two, total growth, and percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   Includes a "Transactions" view for feeding in [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | income]], [[using_notion_for_tracking_expenses | expenses]], asset, and liability details to calculate net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts and Goals

### Setting Your Net Worth Goal
To begin, set your [[utilizing_notion_to_monitor_net_worth_and_financial_goals | net worth goal]] in the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. You can click on the existing amount (e.g., $10,000) and edit it to your desired goal, such as $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Changing this value automatically updates the entire database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Managing Accounts
The "Account" section displays default accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

*   **Adding a New Account**:
    *   Scroll down within a category (e.g., income, expense, assets, liabilities) and click the "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   A pop-up will appear for details. For example, adding "Interest Income" as a new income account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   **Opening Balance**: Income and [[using_notion_for_tracking_expenses | expenses]] accounts typically do not have an opening balance, but assets and liabilities can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This represents the value at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Classifying Accounts**:
    *   Assign a tag to classify the account, such as "Groceries" under "Bills" or "Netflix" under "Subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   You can select from existing categories or add your own, like "Other Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**:
    *   Specify how often you receive or make payments for an account (e.g., "monthly" for salary, "quarterly" for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. You can also add custom frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Opening Units and Asset Class (for Investments)**:
    *   These fields are primarily used for investments, such as Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   An investment like Bitcoin might have an opening balance (e.g., $100) and opening units (e.g., 10 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   The "Asset Class" for investments should be set to "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>; for other accounts, it can be left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   For savings (e.g., "Car Fund"), the classification can be set to "Savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Accounts**:
    *   Click on the pencil icon next to an account to open an edit window and modify its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Liabilities
Under the "Liabilities" section, you can add your [[using_notion_for_debt_tracking | debt payments]] and other loans, setting their respective payment frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions

The "Transactions" section allows you to record all financial activities. It has four main views: [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | Income]], [[using_notion_for_tracking_expenses | Expense]], Asset, and Liabilities, along with an "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Transactions are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Adding a New Transaction
1.  Click the "new" button within any transaction view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
2.  **Date**: Select the transaction date. Changing the date automatically classifies it into the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  **Description**: Add a brief description (e.g., "Salary Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
4.  **Category**: This is automatically set based on the view (e.g., "Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
5.  **Account**: Select the specific account related to the transaction (e.g., "Salary Account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
6.  **Payment Mode**: Indicate how the money was received or paid (e.g., "Bank Account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
7.  **Transaction Type**:
    *   **Inflow**: Money coming into your account (e.g., [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | income]] transactions, obtaining a new loan, or selling an asset) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   **Outflow**: Money going out of your account (e.g., [[using_notion_for_tracking_expenses | expenses]], purchasing an asset, or repaying a loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
8.  **Amount**: Enter the transaction amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
9.  **Document**: Attach any receipts or bills by embedding a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Understanding the Summary Section

After inputting all transactions and accounts, the "Summary" section calculates your net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Finances View
This view shows the current standing of all [[using_notion_for_tracking_expenses | expenses]], [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | income]], assets, and liabilities. It displays the specific amount for each account and its proportion to the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Net Worth View
This view provides five key statistical figures:
1.  **Net Worth Goal**: The goal you set earlier (e.g., $14,000, then $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This value can be adjusted directly from this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
2.  **Total Net Worth**: Calculated as the difference between your total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. For example, $6950 (assets) - $1600 (liabilities) = $5350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
3.  **Difference**: The difference between your Net Worth Goal and your Total Net Worth (e.g., $12,000 - $5350 = $6650) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
4.  **Total Growth**: The closing net worth value minus the opening net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The opening net worth is derived from the opening balances specified for assets and liabilities (e.g., $1900 + $900 = $1000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
5.  **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows how much of your net worth goal has been accomplished (e.g., $5350 / $12,000 = 45%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

Your net worth figures automatically update as you add new transactions and deal with different items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

This article details how to find the difference between two numbers within a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The process involves [[using_formulas_in_notion | using two different formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>: the [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] and the minus sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Setting Up the Database

To begin, create a new database in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>:
1.  Type a forward slash `/` and then `database` to open the list of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  The first property of the database will be the title property, which indicates the purpose of the action being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  Assign number properties to two different columns where the numbers for which you want to find the difference will be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Methods for Finding the Difference

Once your database is set up with two number properties, you can apply a [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] to calculate the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Using the Subtract Operator

The [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] is one method to find the difference between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, if "Number 1" and "Number 2" are provided as inputs, the formula will yield their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Using the Minus Sign

Alternatively, you can use the minus sign (`-`) to find the difference between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This method functions similarly to the [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] by subtracting one number from another.

By utilizing either the [[use_of_subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] or the minus sign in a formula property, you can effectively find the difference between two numbers within a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

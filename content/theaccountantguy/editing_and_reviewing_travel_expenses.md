This article details how to utilize a travel expense tracker to [[classifying_and_managing_travel_expenses | keep track of all your travel expenses and plan ahead]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The system includes sections for accounts, expenses, and an overall summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Setting Up and Classifying Expenses

To begin, you set up different expense categories under the "accounts" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Expenses are typically classified under categories such as Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Expense Sources

*   **Adding a New Source:** To quickly add a new expense source, click on the "add expense source" button, which automatically adds it to the travel category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Editing Details:** Click the pencil icon next to an expense source to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For example, you can change a source name to "Metro" and set a budgeted amount like $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Moving Categories:** An expense source can be moved to a different category, such as "Meals," by clicking the three dots next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Adding New Top-Level Categories:** To create an entirely new expense group separate from existing categories like Travel, Meals, and Lodging, click the plus sign on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. You can also edit existing groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Reviewing Expenses and Budget Performance

Once accounts are set up and budgeted amounts are assigned to each expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, the "expenses" section allows for [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | tracking expenses against a budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

This view displays:
*   Total incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   The budgeted expense set for that item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense that has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

For instance, if flight expenses are $2,000 against a $1,000 budget, it shows as 200% and is indicated in red, signifying an overspend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Conversely, if breakfast expenses are $100 against a $300 budget, it shows as 33% and is indicated in green, meaning it's within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This provides a quick, at-a-glance view of where expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Overall Summary

The summary section offers an [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | overview of expenses and budget tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It shows:
*   Total budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Total incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The difference between the two totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   A percentage reflecting total expenses divided by budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. For example, 59% means 59% of the budgeted expense has been reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Booking and Adding New Expenses

Expenses are classified under the same three categories: Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Quick addition buttons are available for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Steps to Add an Expense:
1.  **Select Category:** Click on a quick addition button, for example, "add travel expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This adds a new expense entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
2.  **Add Details:**
    *   **Description:** Enter a description for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Trip Info:** Specify details about the trip, such as "Trip to Paris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This can be edited by clicking the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **Account:** Select the specific expense account, e.g., "Train" for a travel expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   **Amount:** Enter the expense amount, e.g., $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Once an expense like $100 for a train is booked, it immediately reflects in the expenses summary under "Train" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. If a budgeted expense (e.g., $200 for train) is set, the system will reflect the percentage spent (e.g., 50%) and indicate it in green if within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This allows for continuous [[managing_different_types_of_business_expenses | management]] and planning of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

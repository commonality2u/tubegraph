The Notion Formula Chatbot is designed to assist [[using_formulas_in_notion | Notion users]] who find it challenging to create formulas for their specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This chatbot helps derive the exact formula needed when [[using_formulas_in_notion | using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Getting Started

Before [[interacting_with_the_notion_formula_chatbot_and_testing_it_with_different_questions | interacting with the chatbot]], users must input their OpenAI API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. After entering the API key, the GPT model needs to be selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Generating an OpenAI API Key
To generate an OpenAI API key, users can click on the question mark icon within the chatbot interface, which provides a link to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. On the OpenAI platform, navigate to "API Keys" and click "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Users should copy this generated key and save it, as it will not be visible again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Once the key is pasted into the chatbot, a message confirms that the API key has been entered, allowing users to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### OpenAI Free Credits
When creating an OpenAI account, users typically receive a $5 free credit that can be used for testing the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This free credit is usually limited to the GPT 3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Selecting a GPT Model
The chatbot offers two GPT models:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo**: This is an older model and is slightly less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. It is available for free accounts and for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The demonstrations in the video were performed using this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **GPT 4106 Preview**: This model is more accurate and provides better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. It is recommended for users on a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Interacting with the Chatbot

The chatbot interface is divided into three main sections:
*   **Info Section**: Provides details related to the chatbot and includes an embedded explanatory video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Chat Section**: Where users [[interacting_with_the_notion_formula_chatbot_and_testing_it_with_different_questions | interact with the bot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Give Section**: Contains a donation button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

To begin [[interacting_with_the_notion_formula_chatbot_and_testing_it_with_different_questions | interacting]], simply type a message in the chat section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The chatbot instantly generates responses to user questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Examples of Formula Questions
The chatbot can provide [[using_formulas_in_notion | Notion formulas]] for various scenarios:

*   **Adding Two Numbers**:
    When asked "What is the formula to [[using_formulas_to_add_numbers_in_notion | add two numbers in Notion]]?", the chatbot responds that `property A + property B` can be used, where Property A and B are the input numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

*   **Finding Time Difference Between Dates**:
    For a question like "What is the formula to find the difference between the birth date and today's date in years in Notion?", the chatbot suggests using the `dateBetween` formula, specifying 'years' as the unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **If-Condition Logic**:
    A more complex query, such as "If number one is greater than number two, I want to generate number one as the output, otherwise I want to generate number two as the output," is also handled fluently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The chatbot provides the corresponding `if` condition formula with a detailed explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The chatbot provides immediate responses and explanations for the formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For optimal results, users may need to provide better prompts, including proper examples or references to what they are trying to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Customization and Additional Features

### User Image
Users can upload an image, which will update the user icon displayed next to their questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

From the dropdown, users can choose "Light" for a light background, "Dark" to return to the dark theme, or "System settings" to customize colors and font family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Left Panel Visibility

This is particularly useful for smartphone or other device users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

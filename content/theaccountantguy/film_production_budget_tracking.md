Film production involves numerous expenses that require careful tracking. A dedicated [[components_of_the_budget_tracker | film production budget tracker]] can be utilized to manage all related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Template Overview
The tracker is presented as a template, featuring a table that systematically lists each expense, its category, and the corresponding amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Customization and Input
*   **Defining Categories**: Users can define their own expense categories by clicking a pencil icon, with updates reflected bidirectionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Updating Budgeted Values**: The budgeted expense value can be updated directly within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Entering Actual Expenses**: Expense amounts can be entered, and these updates are also reflected bidirectionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Real-time Updates**: All values are updated instantly upon entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## [[summary_and_analysis_of_film_production_expenses | Expense Summary]]
A dedicated summary section provides a concise overview of the financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This section includes:
*   The budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and actual figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

This offers a complete [[budgeted_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | summary of total expenses]], showing how current spending compares to the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Managing Categories
Within the category section, users have several management options:
*   Add a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Edit an existing category using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Delete a particular category via a three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

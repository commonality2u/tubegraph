A film production budget tracker is a tool designed to help keep track of all expenses related to film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Template Features

### Expense Tracking
The template includes a table that lists all expenses individually, along with their respective categories and the recorded expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Users can enter expense amounts, and these updates are reflected across the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### [[expense_categorization_in_film_production | Expense Categorization]]
Each expense is associated with a specific category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Users have the flexibility to define their own categories, which updates throughout the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | Budget vs Actual Tracking]]
The template provides a summary section that details:
*   The budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The percentage of expenses relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

This summary offers an overview of total expenses and how they compare to the current budget status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This feature supports [[budget_summary_and_tracking | budget summary and tracking]] and [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | tracking expenses against budget]].

## Template Customization and Management
The film production budget tracker is completely customizable to meet specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Key management features include:
*   **Defining Categories:** Users can define their own expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Updating Budgeted Values:** Budgeted expense values can be updated directly within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories:** New categories can be added using a "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Editing Categories:** Existing categories can be edited via a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories:** Categories can be deleted through a three-dot menu option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

This flexibility allows for [[monthly_budget_management_and_updates | monthly budget management and updates]] and adaptation to project-specific needs.

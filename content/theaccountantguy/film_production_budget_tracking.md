A film production budget tracker is a template designed to help [[managing_film_production_expenses | keep track of all expenses related to film production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This tool facilitates [[budgeting_and_expense_tracking | budgeting and expense tracking]] specifically for film projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Core Functionality

The tracker features a table that lists individual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Each entry includes:
*   The expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Its respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The category is reflected directly in the entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   The ability to enter the expense amount, which updates the tracker instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Customization

The template is fully customizable to meet specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Categories**: Users can define their own categories by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Changes to categories are updated bidirectionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. New categories can also be added via a "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, and existing ones can be edited or deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Budgeted Expenses**: The budgeted expense value can be updated directly within the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. All values update instantly once these changes are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Summary Section

The summary section provides a comprehensive overview of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It includes:
*   The total budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The percentage of expenses relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

This summary helps in [[understanding_and_tracking_budgeted_versus_actual_expenses | comparing budgeted and actual film expenses]] and provides a quick overview of the current financial status of the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The monthly budget planner in Notion is designed to help users [[budget_management_with_notion | budget for each month]] by providing an organized way to track and categorize expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The system utilizes an underlying "expense details database" where all financial information is entered, which then calculates and updates all related figures automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Overview of the Monthly Budget Planner

The Notion monthly budget planner features four main views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
*   **Expenses Overview**: This view lists various expense categories, such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For each category, it displays the total expense amount, the budgeted amount, the percentage of the budgeted amount incurred, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is still under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview**: Presents the same expense details discussed above but formatted by month, allowing users to see all expenses at a glance for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview**: Displays the exact same information as the monthly overview but presented in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary**: Offers a complete overlook of expenses in a yearly format, grouping all expenses together to provide an overall performance summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## [[entering_and_categorizing_transactions_in_notion | Entering and Categorizing Transactions in Notion]]

To begin [[tracking_expenses_with_notion | tracking expenses with Notion]], transactions are entered into the "expense details" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Expenses are categorized by month, with the most recent months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Steps to Enter a Transaction
1.  **Add New Entry**: Click on "new" to create a new transaction record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  **Date**: Enter the transaction date; the month will automatically update accordingly (e.g., entering April 1, 2024, will place it in the April month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  **Expense Detail**: Type in the specific expense, e.g., "Wi-Fi expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  **Period**: Select the corresponding period (e.g., "Feb 2024"). New periods can be added if not already displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
5.  **Year**: Select the year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  **Category**: Choose the type of expense from predefined categories (e.g., "Utilities"). Users can also [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | add their own categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
7.  **Expense Code**: This field is used to segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "Utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  **Expense Amount**: Input the actual amount of the expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

It's important to distinguish between the "expense amount" column, used for booking the actual expense, and the "budget amount" column, used at the start of the month to set a budget for a specific expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## [[setting_up_expense_categories_in_notion | Setting up Expense Categories in Notion]] and Budgets

At the beginning of each month, users can [[budget_management_with_notion | set up a budget]] for specific expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Steps to Set a Budget for a Category
1.  **Date**: Select the first day of the month (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  **Expense Name**: Enter the name of the expense for which the budget is being set (e.g., "Food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  **Period and Year**: Select the appropriate period and year, similar to entering a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  **Category**: Select the relevant expense category (e.g., "Food"). When setting a budget, the expense name and the category name typically remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
5.  **Expense Code**: Input the expense code, which combines the category and the month/year (e.g., "Food Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
6.  **Budget Amount**: Enter the budgeted amount in the "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once entered, these figures automatically update the financial overviews at the top of the planner for the respective months and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Analyzing Categorized Expenses

After booking all expenses, the Notion template allows for deep analysis of financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Period View**: Clicking on a "period" (e.g., "Feb 2024") opens a new window displaying all transactions booked for that period, including the amounts and whether they were actual expenses or budget entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Year View**: Similarly, clicking on a "year" shows the budgeted amount, expense amount, expense as a percentage of budget, and the status for the entire year, along with all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Category View**: Users can also view how much expense has been booked for a particular category. This view displays the expense amount, budgeted amount, percentage, and status for that category, including all related transactions and their amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View**: The "expense code" allows users to see how much has been booked for a specific category within a particular month, comparing it against the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

These views enable users to [[using_notion_for_expense_management | track their finances]] effectively and understand their spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Customization

The Notion monthly budget planner can be [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | further customized]] to suit individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

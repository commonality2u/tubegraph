### [[managing_budget_versus_actual_expenses | Managing Budget Versus Actual Expenses]]
For every category, the tracker displays both a [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_expenses | budgeted expense amount]] and an [[comparing_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | actual expense amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

*   **Setting Budgeted Expenses**
    Users can [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_expenses | set their own budgeted expense amount]] for each category by clicking on the budgeted expense amount field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Changes to these figures immediately update the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

*   **Tracking Actual Expenses**
    Specific expenses are listed in a table, and as amounts are entered, the categories at the top automatically update with the [[adding_and_managing_expenses | respective actual expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Summary Section**
    The summary section provides a clear overview, displaying the total [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_expenses | budgeted expense amount]] and the total actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

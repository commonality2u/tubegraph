In Notion, you can [[creating_a_database_in_notion | create a database]] to perform calculations, such as finding the product of two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Once a [[creating_a_database_in_notion | database]] is set up, you can [[assigning_properties_in_notion | assign properties]] to numbers and apply formulas to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Database Setup

A basic [[setting_up_and_using_databases_in_notion | database]] for calculating products includes several [[setting_up_notion_database_properties | properties]]:
*   **Name of the operator** This [[assigning_properties_in_notion | property]] is a title [[setting_up_notion_database_properties | property]], typically named "multiply operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Number 1** This is a number [[setting_up_notion_database_properties | property]] where the first number is input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Number 2** This is another number [[setting_up_notion_database_properties | property]] for the second input number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Calculating the Product

The product of two numbers in a Notion [[setting_up_and_using_databases_in_notion | database]] can be calculated using two different formula methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Using the Multiply Operator Formula

One method involves using a "multiply operator" formula [[setting_up_notion_database_properties | property]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In this formula, the two numbers are provided as inputs to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. For instance, if the numbers are 2 and 3, the product will be 6 using this formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Using the Multiply Symbol

Another method for calculation is to use a formula [[setting_up_notion_database_properties | property]] that directly incorporates the multiply symbol (`*`) between the two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

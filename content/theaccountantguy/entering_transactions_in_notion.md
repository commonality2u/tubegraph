This business cash flow template in Notion allows you to [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | track]] and [[organizing_financial_transactions_in_notion | organize]] financial [[utilizing_the_transaction_and_profit_loss_sections_in_notion | transactions]] to gain insight into your business's cash flow. [[entering_transactions_and_budgeting_in_notion | Entering transactions]] is core to operating the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Overview of Transaction Views

The template provides specific views for different transaction types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>:
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
*   **Expense** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
*   **Asset** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>
*   **Liability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>
*   **Investments**: Allows specifying units and price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Inventory**: Allows specifying units and price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

When viewing a specific section like "income," transactions are divided by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## How to Add Transactions

To add a transaction, you can use the dedicated buttons on the left side of the template: "Add Income," "Add Expense," "Add Asset," and "Add Liability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Clicking one of these buttons automatically adds a new transaction with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The following details can be entered for each transaction:

*   **Date**: The date can be changed using a calendar pop-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Period**: Specify the relevant accounting period, such as "January 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief explanation of the transaction, e.g., "Sales Revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Account**: Select the specific account related to the transaction from a list of predefined accounts (e.g., Sales Revenue account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. These accounts are set up in the "Account Section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode**: Indicate how the payment was received or made, such as "cash" or "bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Type of Cash**: Classifies the transaction based on business activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>:
    *   **Operating**: Activities related to core business operations, like sales revenue or salary payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
    *   **Investing**: Investments made for the business, such as stock or mutual fund investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
    *   **Financing**: Activities related to raising loans or debt for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Transaction Type**: Denotes the flow of cash in the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>:
    *   **Inflow**: Cash coming into the business (e.g., income transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   **Outflow**: Cash going out of the business (e.g., expense transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   For assets and liabilities, assess whether cash is coming in or going out to select the appropriate type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Documents**: Option to attach relevant documents like sales receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate**: If applicable, entering a tax rate will automatically calculate the tax amount based on the entered transaction amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

The same principle for [[entering_and_tracking_transactions_in_notion_budget_planner | entering]] and [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | tracking]] transactions applies to expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. For investments and inventory, specific fields like units and price are available to calculate values and profit/loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Automatic Updates

Once transactions are entered, the template automatically updates key financial summaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>:

*   **Cash Flow Overview**: The [[summary_and_transaction_sections_in_notion | summary section]] on the left, showing opening balance, total inflow, cash outflow, and closing balance, updates as transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Overview**: Displays monthly cash flow movement (inflow, outflow, and net balance) divided into quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Business Activity**: Provides a quick overview of operating, investing, and financing activities, including their respective inflow, outflow, and net balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Troubleshooting Updates
Figures might sometimes take a moment to update. If they don't, simply click on the sum/balance calculation area and reselect "sum" or "balance" to force an update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

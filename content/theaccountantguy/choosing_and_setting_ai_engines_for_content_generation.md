Visen is a platform designed to [[ai_content_generation_for_notion | create AI generated content on your Notion workspace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. To begin using Visen for content generation, initial settings need to be configured, including the selection and setup of an AI engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Accessing Settings

The settings tab can be accessed by clicking the gear icon on the home screen or by selecting "settings" from the sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Selecting an AI Engine

Within the settings tab, the "AI engine" section allows you to choose between available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Available AI engines include:
*   Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

If Gemini is selected, the corresponding Gemini API key must be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. If GPT is selected, the OpenAI API key needs to be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Generating Gemini API Key

To obtain a Gemini API key:
1.  Navigate to `AI Studio.google.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
2.  Click on "get API key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
3.  Create a new API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
4.  Copy the generated key and paste it into the "AI API key" section within Visen's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Gemini offers free access to its engines, though with certain usage limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This makes it a suitable option for testing the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Generating OpenAI API Key (for GPT)

To obtain an OpenAI API key:
1.  Head over to `platform.openai.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
2.  Go to the "API Keys" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  Click on "create new secret API key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
4.  A new secret key will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
5.  Copy this key and paste it into the appropriate field in Visen's settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike Gemini, the OpenAI API key is a paid service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Saving Settings

After defining all necessary settings, including the AI engine and API key, click the "Save" button to apply the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. All settings entered are saved in local storage, ensuring data privacy as they are not stored on external clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Users can also clear these settings from local storage by clicking the "clear" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

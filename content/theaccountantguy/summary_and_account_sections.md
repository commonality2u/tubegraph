The Paycheck Budget Tracker is designed to help users track their paycheck payments and budget effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The tracker is divided into two main sections: the Summary section on the left and the Account section on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This organization helps in [[sections_in_the_paycheck_tracker__records_payments_and_summary | records payments and summary]].

## Summary Section

The Summary section, located on the left side of the tracker, provides a [[summary_section_of_notion_bills_tracker | summary view]] of your financial activity related to expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This section aids in [[using_a_summary_section_to_track_payment_totals | using a summary section to track payment totals]] by displaying key financial figures:

*   **Total Budgeted Expenses** The total amount you have set aside for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Total Incurred Expenses** The actual expenses you have spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Difference** The variance between your total budgeted expenses and your total incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Budgeted Expense** This metric shows how much of your allocated budget has been spent to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Account Section

On the right side of the tracker is the Account section, where users manage their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This section facilitates [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_notion | managing accounts and transactions]].

Users can add expenses under three default categories:
*   Fixed Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

The categories can be customized by clicking on them and setting a new category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Once categories are set, users can input their budgeted amount for each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Integration with Transactions

After setting budgeted amounts, users proceed to the transaction section to log all related transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. These transactions automatically update the expense view, reflecting the total budgeted amount, incurred expenses, and the percentage of budgeted expense incurred for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This overview is similar to [[overview_and_analysis_of_expenses_in_notion | overview and analysis of expenses]].

### Quick Action Buttons

The tracker also features quick action buttons to streamline data entry:

*   **Add Transaction** Automatically adds a new transaction with the current date, allowing users to quickly input details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Add Expense Source** Creates a new expense under one of the predefined heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. New expense sources can be moved and placed under any specific expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The integrated nature of these sections allows users to keep track of budgeted payments and manage their finances effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

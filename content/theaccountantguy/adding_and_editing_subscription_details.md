The subscription expenses tracker helps manage [[tracking_subscription_transactions_and_payments | all subscription expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

The "subscription overview" section provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

It presents subscriptions categorized into:
*   Active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

Within each category, details shown include the subscription name, total expenses incurred, and the [[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | billing period]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The [[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | billing period]] can be changed by clicking on it and selecting an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While the name of the [[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | billing period]] can be changed, it is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## [[tracking_subscription_transactions_and_payments | Tracking Subscription Transactions]]

The transaction section is used to record all subscription expense details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It shows views for both active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> and canceled subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with later months appearing at the top, along with the total sum of expenses for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Adding Transaction Details

To add transaction details for a subscription:

2.  **Subscription Account**: Select the specific subscription account from a list populated by previously added subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  **[[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | Billing Period]]**: This value is pulled automatically from the top-level setting for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  **Payment Date**: Choose the date of the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
5.  **Amount**: Enter the subscription expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

For example, if a Netflix subscription payment on September 30 had a monthly [[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | billing period]], the next renewal date would be October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

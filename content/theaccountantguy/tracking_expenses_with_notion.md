This article details how to utilize a monthly budget planner template in Notion to track and manage expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The system is designed to help users budget for each month and monitor their financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Overview of the Budget Planner

The Notion monthly budget planner features four primary views to provide a comprehensive financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

*   **Expenses Overview** This section displays various expense categories, such as shopping, entertainment, food expenses, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it shows the total incurred expense amount, the budgeted amount, the percentage of the budgeted amount spent, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview** This view organizes all expenses by month, allowing users to see a quick glance of their spending for each period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** Similar to the monthly overview, this view presents expense information in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Summary** The summary section provides a complete annual expense overlook, consolidating all expenses to give a high-level overview of overall financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

To use the budget planner, all expense information is entered into the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Expenses within this database are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Steps to Enter a Transaction

1.  **Click "New"**: Begin by clicking the "New" button to add a new transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  **Enter Date**: Input the date of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The system automatically adjusts for the corresponding month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  **Expense Detail**: Provide a description of the expense, for example, "Wi-Fi expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  **Select Period**: Choose the relevant period (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Users can add new periods if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  **Select Year**: Specify the year of the expense (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  **Assign Category**: Select the appropriate category for the expense from predefined options (e.g., "utilities", "food", "shopping", "entertainment") or add a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
7.  **Expense Code**: Input an expense code to segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "Utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  **Expense Amount**: Enter the amount of the actual expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The database includes two main columns for amounts: "expense amount" for actual spending and "budget amount" for setting budgets at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Setting a Budget

At the beginning of each month, users can set budgets for specific expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Steps to Set a Budget

1.  **Select Date**: Choose the first day of the month for which the budget is being set (e.g., "February 1") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  **Expense Name**: Enter the name of the expense for which the budget is being set (e.g., "Food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  **Select Period**: Choose the relevant monthly period (e.g., "February") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  **Select Year**: Specify the year (e.yt-timestampg., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
5.  **Assign Category**: Select the category for the budgeted expense (e.g., "food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For budgets, the expense name and category name should typically be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
6.  **Expense Code**: Input the expense code (e.g., "Food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
7.  **Budget Amount**: Enter the planned budget amount in the "budget column" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once budgets are set and expenses are continually added, all figures in the overview sections automatically update, providing real-time insights into monthly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This template can be used for [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | tracking personal finances in Notion]] or for [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]].

## Analyzing Financial Data

The budget planner allows for detailed analysis of financial information through various clickable elements:

*   **Period View**: Clicking on a specific period (e.g., "Feb 2024") reveals a new window showing all transactions booked for that period, including the details of the amount and whether it was a budget or an expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Year View**: Similarly, clicking on a year provides a view of the budgeted amount, actual expenses, expense as a percentage of the budget, and the budget status for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It also lists all transactions for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Category View**: Users can view how much expense has been booked for a particular category, showing the expense amount, budgeted amount, percentage, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It also displays all related expenses for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View**: This allows users to see the amount booked for a specific category within a particular month compared to its total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

By utilizing these views, users can effectively keep track of their finances and understand their spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

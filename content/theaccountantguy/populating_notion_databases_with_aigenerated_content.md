Wien is a platform designed to help users [[creating_ai_generated_content_on_notion_pages_and_databases | create AI-generated content directly onto their Notion workspace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This content can be generated for either a Notion page or a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A Notion page is a simple blank page, while a database is structured with rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Generating Content for a Notion Page

For a Notion page, the process involves selecting the "notion page" option and providing the page's URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A specific prompt, such as "write me a block of 100 words on Notion," is then entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The AI will then generate the content directly onto the specified Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Populating a Notion Database with AI Content

To [[integrating_aigenerated_content_into_notion | integrate AI-generated content into a Notion database]], follow these steps:

1.  **Select Database Type**
    Choose the "notion database" option within Wien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
2.  **Provide Database URL**
    Copy and paste the URL of the Notion database into the designated section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
3.  **Define Prompt**
    If the database has multiple topics or entries across its rows, a single prompt can be used to generate content for each of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For example, a prompt like "write me a block of 100 words on the topic" will instruct the AI to generate content relevant to each specific topic in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
4.  **Content Generation**
    Once the prompt is set, the AI will begin populating content into the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The content is generated row by row, ensuring that every entry in the database receives its corresponding AI-generated text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This functionality allows users to efficiently [[creating_ai_generated_content_on_notion_pages_and_databases | generate AI content]] for multiple entries within their [[creating_databases_for_people_and_events_in_notion | Notion databases]], making it a powerful tool for content creation and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

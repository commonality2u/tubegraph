This guide demonstrates how to set up automated debt payment reminders that are delivered directly to your WhatsApp, ensuring you receive timely notifications on the due date of your loan payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This system is completely customizable for various uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Example: Car Loan Reminder

An example demonstrates a car loan payment due on September 23 for an amount of $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The WhatsApp message received for this reminder is structured as a "debt payment reminder alert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The message includes:
*   A greeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   The type of loan (e.g., car loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   The due date (e.g., September 23) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   The amount due (e.g., $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   A "Pay Now" button that, when clicked, redirects you to your bank portal or chosen payment link (e.g., PayPal) to repay the loan instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This feature allows for [[integrating_payment_links_with_reminder_alerts | integrating payment links with reminder alerts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Setting Up Reminders

To [[receiving_timely_payment_reminders_through_whatsapp | receive timely payment reminders through WhatsApp]] and [[using_automated_notifications_for_loan_payments | use automated notifications for loan payments]], the first step is to [[creating_templates_for_loan_payment_reminders | create a template for each loan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### Creating a Loan Template
1.  Click on the drop-down menu and select the "new template" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
2.  Input the loan details, such as the loan type (e.g., car loan) and the repayment amount (e.g., $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

### Scheduling Recurring Notifications
To [[scheduling_recurring_bill_payment_notifications | schedule recurring bill payment notifications]], you can set up repetition for the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Repetition Frequency**: You can set the repetition to be on a monthly basis, meaning the loan information will populate each month in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   **Repetition Day**: Specify the day of the month for the repetition (e.g., the 16th) and a specific time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This ensures that the line item for the loan gets added to the database automatically every month on the chosen day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Adjusting Notification Timing
You can choose when to receive the notification relative to the actual due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Early Notification**: To receive a notification "X" days before the due date, input the number of days (e.g., 7 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. For instance, if a loan is due on September 23, setting it to 7 days will trigger a notification on September 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **On Due Date**: If you want the notification on the same day as the due date, set the value to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

Once the recurring template is set for each loan, an automation is triggered to send the payment notification message to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This process applies to various scenarios, including [[setting_up_bill_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | setting up bill payment reminders on WhatsApp]], [[automating_subscription_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | automating subscription payment reminders on WhatsApp]], [[setting_up_repayment_notifications_for_credit_cards | setting up repayment notifications for credit cards]], and [[setting_up_scheduled_triggers_for_invoice_reminders | setting up scheduled triggers for invoice reminders]].

## Automation in Action

The system can automatically add new loan entries and trigger WhatsApp notifications. For example, an "education loan" can be set up to appear at a specific time on a specific date (e.g., 3:55 PM on September 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. When the specified time arrives, the new loan details are populated, and a payment alert is automatically triggered on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

This automation technique can be applied to any number of loans you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## Customization and Management

*   **Custom Messages**: You can create custom messages for your reminders based on your requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Deleting Templates**: Once a loan is repaid, you can simply delete its template to prevent repeated notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

For detailed instructions and relevant information, a separate video is available upon downloading the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

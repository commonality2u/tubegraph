This article provides an overview of managing employee records and tracking training attendance using a Notion-based [[notion_template_for_employee_payment_tracking | employee training expenses tracker]]. The dashboard offers a centralized view for both training overviews and employee records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Training Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard provides two key views:

A crucial component of the [[how_to_track_net_worth_using_notion | Notion net worth tracker]] is the ability to monitor your financial position on a monthly basis, offering a clear breakdown of assets and liabilities. This section provides an overview of your total assets, total liabilities, and net worth for each month, alongside the change in net worth over the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It also includes detailed breakdowns of your specific assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Monthly Net Worth Overview

The monthly net worth overview specifies four key figures for each month:
*   Total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   Total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Net worth for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   Change in net worth for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

This section is linked to the [[net_worth_goal_and_progress_tracking | net worth database]] and displayed in a gallery layout on the primary dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Assets Breakdown

The assets breakdown provides a detailed breakup of all assets, showing their individual proportions relative to the total asset amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   It lists individual assets, classified into five categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   For each asset, the total amount from all months combined is rolled up from earlier databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The proportion of each asset to the total value of all assets combined is calculated and represented visually, such as with a green bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Liabilities Breakdown

Similar to the assets breakdown, the liabilities breakdown details four types of liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. It specifies the corresponding amount and proportion of each liability to the total liability amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Both the assets and liabilities breakdowns are linked to their respective databases and are displayed in a gallery layout on the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Underlying Databases

To enable the monthly net worth and financial breakdown, the tracker utilizes several interconnected databases:

### Assets and Liabilities Database
This database is fundamental for [[tracking_assets_liabilities_and_net_worth_in_business | recording all assets and liabilities]] for each specific month during the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Asset Description**: Specifies up to five types of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**: A number property indicating the asset's value at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Amount**: Shows additions or deletions of assets for the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Closing Balance**: Calculated by adding the `Opening Balance` to the `Amount` during the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   The `Closing Balance` of each month must be copied and pasted as the `Opening Balance` for the subsequent month for all assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Assets Breakdown and Liabilities Breakdown Databases
These databases essentially provide a breakup of all assets and liabilities, showing their individual proportions to the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   They list the assets and liabilities with their total amounts rolled up from the `Assets and Liabilities Database` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The percentage of each asset or liability relative to the total value is calculated using a formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Net Worth Database
This database is where the core monthly net worth calculations occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Total Assets**: Considers the closing balance of assets for each month, rolled over from the `Assets and Liabilities Database` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Total Liabilities**: Considers the closing balance of liabilities for each month, rolled over from the `Assets and Liabilities Database` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Net Worth**: Calculated by deducting total liabilities from total assets for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Change in Net Worth**: Calculated by deducting the closing net worth from the opening net worth for the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

These databases collectively ensure comprehensive [[monitoring_investments_and_net_worth | monitoring investments and net worth]] on a monthly basis, providing a detailed financial snapshot.

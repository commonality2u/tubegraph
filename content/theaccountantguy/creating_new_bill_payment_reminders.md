Sanat Biswal, also known as "the accountant guy," demonstrates how to [[setting_up_bill_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | set up bill payment reminders on WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This system allows users to [[receiving_whatsapp_notifications_for_bill_payments | receive WhatsApp notifications for bill payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## How to Set Up a New Bill Payment Reminder

To create a new bill payment reminder and [[setting_recurring_notifications_for_bills | set recurring notifications for bills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:

1.  **Start a New Template**: Click on the drop-down menu, then select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **Input Bill Details**:
    *   Write the bill name (e.g., "Mobile bill") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
    *   Specify the bill amount (e.g., $1500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
3.  **Set Recurrence**:
    *   Click "back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   Click the drop-down again, then the three dots, and set the bill to repeat on a recurring basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
    *   Choose the frequency, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   Specify the exact time for receiving the notification (e.g., 11:55) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> and the day of the month (e.g., the 20th of every month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once saved, the system will be set to repeat this notification every month on the specified date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation and Notifications

This system requires the help of an [[automation_of_recurring_payment_notifications | automation]] tool like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The entire automation setup within Pabbly Connect includes a detailed explanation and guide when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Once the automation is configured, notifications will be automatically sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For example, if a "Mobile bill" is set to notify on the 20th of September at 11:55, a new item will automatically be added and a WhatsApp notification will be sent shortly after the set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The notification typically arrives within a minute of the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The subscription expenses tracker provides sections for overview, categorization, and transaction management, allowing users to efficiently [[handling_subscriptions_and_bill_payments | handle subscriptions and bill payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

The "Subscription Overview" section offers a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Within this section, subscriptions are categorized into two main views:
*   **Active Subscriptions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   **Cancel Subscriptions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

Underneath each category, users can find the name of the subscription, the total expenses incurred, and its [[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | billing period]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The [[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | billing period]] can be changed, though modifying its name is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Expenses Section

The "Expenses" section further divides subscriptions into various classifications like "infotainment," "education," and "music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   New groups can be added by clicking a plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Existing groups can be edited by changing their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   Within each classification, the subscription name, total expenses, and the percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription expenses are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   A "quick action" button allows for adding new subscriptions, which initially appear under a "note" category and can then be moved to an appropriate classification, such as "active mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. A pencil icon is available to [[adding_and_editing_subscription_details | edit subscription details]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction" section is where users [[tracking_subscription_transactions_and_payments | feed payment details]] and [[tracking_subscription_transactions_and_payments | book expenses for subscriptions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   It includes dedicated views for "Active subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> and "Cancel substitution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top, along with the total sum of expenses for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   A checkbox allows users to mark a subscription as active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Details such as the subscription account (pulled from added subscriptions), [[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | billing period]] (pulled from top-level settings), payment date, and amount can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the [[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | billing period]] and payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, a monthly Netflix subscription paid on September 30 will have a renewal date of October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This applies to annual and weekly subscriptions as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   To cancel a subscription, users can simply click a checkbox, which automatically moves it to the "cancel" status, reflecting in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

This system facilitates a quick addition of subscriptions and automatic updates based on entered details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The tracker also includes a tutorial on how to change the currency displayed on the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The Sales Performance OS is a template designed to help businesses track and manage their sales performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Sales Dashboard Overview

The sales dashboard features three primary components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, providing a comprehensive [[sales_dashboard_components | overview of sales data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>:

*   **Salesperson**: Displays individual sales performance, including achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage of target achieved, and whether the target was met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A "Target achieved" status is displayed if sales exceed the target, otherwise "Target not achieved" is shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel**: Tracks sales performance based on their source, such as website, Instagram, or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Users can add custom categories for channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Sales Location**: Monitors sales made to different geographical locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

All three components are organized by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Detailed Overviews

On the left side of the dashboard, detailed overviews are available for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:

*   **Salesperson Overview**: Shows total sales, sales units, and average sales per unit for each individual salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel Overview**: Presents total sales, sale units, and average sales for each sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Sales Location Overview**: Displays sales made to each location, along with average sales and sales units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

These overviews help track and understand business performance throughout the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Sales Transaction Management

Sales transactions can be added and managed directly within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The sales transaction input section mirrors the dashboard, focusing on salesperson, sales channel, and sales location details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

To add a transaction, users enter details such as:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   Account Details (salesperson information) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>
*   Sales Detail (what is being sold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   Month and Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   Client Detail (to whom the sale was made) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   [[customizing_sales_targets_and_codes | Sales Code]] (unique to each salesperson and transaction, e.g., "J. Carter-December-23") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   Sales Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   Sales Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Sales Unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>

These entries facilitate [[tracking_transactions_and_calculating_profitloss | tracking transactions]] and overall sales data management by channel and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Setting Sales Targets

Sales targets can be assigned at the beginning of each month for:
*   Individual salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   Sales channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Sales locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>

A "quick action" button allows for automatic assignment of these targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. For channels, a unique referral code is assigned, and for locations, a unique location tag is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Customization and Filtering

The dashboard is highly customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>:
*   **Editing Details**: Users can instantly edit salesperson details, including names and cover images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Adding Months and Years**: New months and years can be created and added to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Client Information**: Client names and other details like address, city, and state can be entered and managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Currency**: The currency used throughout the dashboard can be changed to a preferred choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Filtering**: Filters can be applied to view performance data for specific years or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This allows users to see trends for all months within a particular year, for example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

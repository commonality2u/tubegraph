This article details how to calculate the product of two numbers within a Notion database using two different formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Database Setup

To calculate the product of two numbers, a database needs to be set up with specific properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:

1.  **Name Property**: A "Title" property to identify the operation, often named "multiply operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  **Number Properties**: Two separate "Number" properties to input the values you wish to multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
3.  **Formula Properties**: Two "Formula" properties, one for each method of calculating the product.

## Methods for Calculating Product

Notion offers two distinct methods for multiplying numbers using formulas. Both are effective for [[using_formulas_in_notion | using formulas in Notion]] to [[using_notion_for_calculations | calculate]] a product.

### 1. Using the `multiply` Operator Formula

This method explicitly uses the `multiply` operator within a Notion formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example
> If you input `2` and `3` into the number properties, the `multiply` operator formula will yield `6` as the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol (`*`)

Alternatively, you can multiply two numbers by placing the `*` (asterisk) symbol between them in a formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This acts as a direct multiplication symbol within the formula.

Both methods enable the calculation of the product of two numbers in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

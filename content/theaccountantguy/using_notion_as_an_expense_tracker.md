This template is versatile and can be used for various needs, including [[using_notion_for_business_expense_tracking | business expenses]] or personal tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. It is also entirely customizable to suit your specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Key Features

### Expense Categories
The tracker features a category section at the top, typically starting with three predefined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These categories can be defined and customized to meet individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

*   **Renaming Categories**
    To rename a category, hover over it until a pencil icon appears. Clicking this icon allows you to type in a new name, which is saved by hitting "enter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Editing or Deleting Categories**
    Categories can be edited or deleted by clicking on the three dots next to the category name and selecting the "delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**
    A new category can be added by simply clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses
For every category, the tracker displays both a budgeted expense amount and an actual expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

*   **Setting Budgeted Expenses**
    The budgeted expense amount can be set by clicking on the designated field within the category section, allowing users to define their desired budget figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. For example, a total budget might be set at $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

*   **Tracking Actual Expenses**
    Below the categories, individual expenses are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. As amounts are entered into these expense fields, all corresponding categories are automatically updated to reflect the actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Summary Section
A dedicated summary section provides an overview of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It displays:
*   The total budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

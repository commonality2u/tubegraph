This article details how to utilize a credit card expenses tracker within Notion to manage and track financial transactions, emphasizing customization and budget setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system is presented by Sanat Biswal, also known as "the accountant guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This template can be [[customizing_finance_systems_in_notion_for_freelancers | customized]] to personal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Overview of the Credit Card Expenses Tracker

The tracker is designed to help users keep track of all credit card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It integrates several key sections for comprehensive financial management:

*   **Credit Cards Overview** Displays all added credit cards, showing the total amount due, amount repaid, and the remaining balance due for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. For example, a demonstration shows four credit cards: Student, Cash Back, Travel, and Rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Monthly Overview** Provides a summary of amounts due, repaid, and balances for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This section is [[creating_a_minimalistic_budget_planner_using_notion | customizable]] to individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Yearly Overview** Shows the total amount due, repaid, and balance due for different years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Expense Detail Section** This is where all expenses are entered in detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Expenses Overview** Offers a summary of all booked expenses categorized with total expenses, budgeted amounts, and whether spending is under or over budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This acts as a central place for [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | budgeting and tracking expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Notification Section** Alerts users to upcoming repayment dates and the number of days remaining until the next payment for each credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This helps in paying credit card debts on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Booking and Tracking Expenses

To begin [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | tracking expenses]], users must book them under the "Expense Details Overview" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The expense details include:
*   Date of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   Details of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Period (e.g., month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   Associated credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   Category for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   Expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Repayment amount (when a payment is made) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

Users can also enter an "opening balance due" for any balances carried forward from previous months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Adding New Information
When entering an expense, users can select an existing credit card or create a new one by typing its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Similarly, categories can be assigned from existing options or new ones can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Once expenses and repayments are entered, all top-level overviews automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Setting and Tracking Budgets

The "Expenses Overview" section is crucial for [[using_notion_templates_for_budget_management | budget management]] and [[budgeting_business_expenses_using_notion | budgeting expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Here, users can:
*   View total expenses incurred for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Set a "budgeted amount" for each expense category by simply clicking and entering the desired figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This allows for [[customizing_a_business_expense_tracker_in_notion | customizing]] the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   See a comparison between the expense amount and the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Determine if spending is "under budget" (within the set limit) or "over budget" (exceeded the limit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For example, if an expense of $5,300 is incurred against a $5,000 budget, it will reflect as "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Customization and Detailed Views

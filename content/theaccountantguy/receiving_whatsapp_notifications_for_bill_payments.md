This article details how to set up and receive automated notifications for bill payments directly on WhatsApp, as demonstrated by Sanat Biswal, "the accountant guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This system allows for [[tracking_payment_details_and_amounts_due | tracking payment details and amounts due]] and ensures timely reminders.

## Setting Up Bill Payment Reminders

The process involves [[setting_up_bill_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | setting up bill payment reminders on WhatsApp]] through a template-based system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Creating a New Reminder
To [[creating_new_bill_payment_reminders | create a new bill payment reminder]]:
1.  Click on the provided dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the name of the bill, such as "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
4.  Specify the bill amount, for example, $1500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Setting Recurring Notifications
After creating the bill template, you can [[setting_recurring_notifications_for_bills | set recurring notifications for bills]]:
1.  Click the dropdown menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots associated with the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Choose the frequency for the bill to repeat, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time and day when you want to receive the notification, e.g., 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once saved, the system will be set to repeat the notification every month on the specified date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation and Notification Delivery

The system relies on an automation tool like Pabbly Connect to send notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This setup facilitates the [[automation_of_recurring_payment_notifications | automation of recurring payment notifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### How Automation Works
*   The entire automation workflow is set up within Pabbly Connect, with a detailed explanation and guide included when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Once the automation is configured and a template is set on a recurring basis, notifications are automatically sent to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   The system demonstrates adding a new bill reminder for "Mobile bill" set for 11:55 AM on the 20th of September, which then appears in the list and triggers a WhatsApp notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Receiving Notifications
*   Notifications are sent directly to WhatsApp, similar to the example shown for a Wi-Fi bill with a due date of September 20th and an amount of $3000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   When a notification time is reached (e.g., 11:55 AM), the WhatsApp message is typically received within a minute or less (e.g., at 11:56 AM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   You will receive notifications on WhatsApp for every bill added and configured with recurring settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The Accounts Receivable and Payable Tracker is designed to [[tracking_income_and_expenses | track income and expenses]], specifically customer and vendor balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It provides various views and sections to manage and summarize financial activities.

## Overview of Sections

### Accounts View
This section allows users to set up customer and vendor details, including their opening balances and the number of invoices due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Users can add new customers or vendors via quick action buttons and edit their details, including initial outstanding balances and pending invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Receivable Section
The receivable section reflects all outstanding customer accounts and their details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It displays individual transactions, such as invoices with their dates and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Users can change the status of an invoice (e.g., pending, paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A checkbox allows marking an invoice as paid, which automatically adjusts the calculated outstanding balance displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Payable Section
Similar to the receivable section, the payable section provides details for each vendor transaction, including the invoice date, invoice number, status, and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Marking an invoice as paid will also adjust the outstanding balance for that vendor at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Summary Section
This section offers an overall summary of all transactions carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It displays the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance, calculated from all transactions entered into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Transaction Section
The transaction section is divided into receivable, payable, and quarterly summary segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

*   **[[adding_transactions_and_expenses | Adding Transactions and Expenses]]**: Users can input the date, period (divided into quarters), description, account name (receivable or payable), amount, invoice number, and status for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. These details automatically update across the entire tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. A 'paid' indicator allows users to specify if an amount has been paid, which affects the total outstanding balances for the concerned parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Quick action buttons facilitate [[entering_and_summarizing_transactions | entering transactions]] for both receivables and payables, automatically picking the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Transactions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

*   **[[summary_and_quarterly_payment_analysis | Quarterly Summary and Payment Analysis]]**: This segment provides a combined summary for all quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For each quarter, it shows the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance (receivable minus payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. A slider allows users to navigate through different quarters to view specific summaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The total amounts across all quarters are also reflected at the top, offering a comprehensive quarterly overview of financial activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

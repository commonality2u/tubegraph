[[introduction_to_wizzygen | Wizzygen]] is a platform designed to facilitate the creation of AI-generated content directly within a [[notion_workspace | Notion]] workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It offers two primary methods for content generation: targeting a [[using_wizzygen_with_notion_databases | Notion database]] or a [[using_wizzygen_with_notion_pages | Notion page]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A Notion page is a straightforward blank page, while a Notion database is structured with rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Generating Content for a Notion Page

To generate AI content on a Notion page, follow these steps:
1.  **Name the Connection**: Begin by providing a name for your connection, such as "notion page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
2.  **Select Target Type**: Choose the "notion page" option from the available selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  **Provide URL**: Copy the URL of your desired Notion page and paste it into the designated URL section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
4.  **Proceed to Prompt**: Click "next" to move to the content generation interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
5.  **Enter Prompt**: Input the desired prompt for AI content generation, for example:
    > "write me a block of 100 words on notion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
6.  **Generate Content**: Once the prompt is entered, the AI will generate and populate the content directly onto the specified Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Generating Content for a Notion Database

Generating AI content for a Notion database involves a similar but distinct process, allowing for bulk generation across multiple topics within the database:
1.  **Name the Connection**: Assign a name to your connection, for instance, "notion database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  **Select Target Type**: Select the "notion database" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
3.  **Provide Database URL**: Navigate to your Notion database, copy its URL, and paste it into the URL field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
4.  **Proceed to Prompt**: Click "next" to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
5.  **Enter Prompt**: Provide a prompt that instructs the AI to generate content for each topic or row in the database. For example, if the database contains multiple topics, you might use:
    > "write me a block of 100 words on the topic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
    > \[!INFO] Wizzygen will dynamically use the topic from each row in the database to generate relevant content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
6.  **Populate Database**: The AI will then proceed to generate content for each row in the database, populating the content in the designated sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This allows for efficient generation of content across various entries in a structured format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Through these methods, [[introduction_to_wizzygen | Wizzygen]] enables users to leverage AI for rapid content creation directly within their [[notion_pages | Notion pages]] and [[notion_databases | Notion databases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

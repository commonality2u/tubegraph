The Customer Payments Tracker is a template designed to [[tracking_transactions_and_invoice_statuses | track]] all customer payments in one location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Payment Summary

The tracker includes a summary section on the left side that displays key payment figures:
*   Total amount of payment due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   Payment amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   The difference between due and received amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Percentage of total payments received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

## Sections of the Tracker

The right side of the tracker is divided into three main sections:
1.  Customer section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
2.  Overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
3.  [[Managing transactions in Notion | Transaction]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

### Customer Section

This section allows users to set up a customer database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It is subdivided into "regular," "seasonal," and "occasional" customer types, which can be edited or expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Each customer entry includes the total payment amount due, which can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. New customers can be [[adding_and_managing_transactions | added]] and existing ones can be edited or deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Overview Section

The overview section displays the total payment received, the payment amount due, and the percentage of payment received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This data is populated from the [[Managing transactions in Notion | transaction]] section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### [[Managing transactions in Notion | Transaction]] Section

This is where individual [[managing_transactions_in_notion | transactions]] are recorded:
*   Users can [[adding_and_managing_transactions | enter]] the date of the [[managing_transactions_in_notion | transaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   A description of the [[managing_transactions_in_notion | transaction]] can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   The customer name for the [[managing_transactions_in_notion | transaction]] can be selected from a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   The amount of the payment received is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

#### Attaching Invoices

A dedicated document section is available within the [[managing_transactions_in_notion | transaction]] entry where users can attach the specific [[exporting_and_managing_invoice_documents | invoice]] related to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Once all [[managing_transactions_in_notion | transaction]] details are filled, the payment received amount in the overview and summary sections automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Customization

The entire template is customizable to meet specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

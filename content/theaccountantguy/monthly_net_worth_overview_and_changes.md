A monthly net worth overview provides a snapshot of your financial position for each month, detailing key financial metrics and highlighting changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This overview is a core component of a [[building_a_net_worth_tracker_using_notion | net worth tracker built using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Components of the Monthly Overview

The monthly net worth overview specifies the following for each month:
*   Total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   Total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Net worth for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Change in net worth for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

## Net Worth Database Calculations

This monthly overview is calculated within the "Net Worth Database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The values for total assets, total liabilities, and net worth are determined as follows:
*   **Total Assets** The closing balance of assets for each month is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Total Liabilities** The closing balance of liabilities for each month is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Net Worth** This is calculated by deducting the total liabilities from the total assets for the specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Change in Net Worth** This metric is derived by deducting the opening net worth from the closing net worth of the assets and liabilities for the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

All amounts used in these calculations are rolled over from the "Assets and Liabilities Database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

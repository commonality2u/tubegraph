A dedicated [[Expense Tracking in Notion | Notion]] template can be used to keep track of a restaurant operation's business expenses efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

*   **Define Budgeted Expenses** You can click on a value to define or adjust a new budgeted expense as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Track Actual Expenses** Actual expenses are automatically pulled from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Monitor Progress** A percentage indicator shows the proportion of actual expenses incurred compared to the budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Managing Expense Categories

The template provides options to manage your expense categories:

The personal finance tracker includes dedicated sections for managing and tracking both subscriptions and recurring bill payments, offering an overview of upcoming and past dues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Setting Up Bill Accounts

To start tracking bills, first navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
1.  Go to the "Expenses" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.
2.  Click "New" to add a new expense account, such as "Wi-Fi bills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.
3.  Classify the expense under "Bills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
4.  Set the [[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | payment frequency]], for example, "Monthly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This means the Wi-Fi bill is expected to be paid monthly and is classified under the bills section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

## Entering Bill Transactions

After setting up bill accounts, navigate to the "Transactions" section, specifically the "Expense" part, to enter bill payment details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.
1.  Enter the date of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.
2.  Add a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
3.  Specify the bill account (e.g., "Wi-Fi bill") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
4.  Select the payment mode (e.g., "Bank") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
5.  Choose "Outflow" as the transaction type, since money is being paid out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
6.  Specify the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

## Tracking Bill Payments

To get an overview of your bills, go to the "Summary" section and click on the "Bills" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. This section categorizes bills into two payment statuses:
*   **Upcoming Payments:** These are bills due in the future, based on the last payment date and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. For example, if a utility bill was last paid on August 17th with a monthly frequency, it will show September 17th as the next due date under upcoming payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>. This can also help in [[scheduling_recurring_bill_payment_notifications | scheduling recurring bill payment notifications]] by providing clear future payment dates.
*   **Past Payments:** This indicates bills that were due in the past but have not yet been paid for the current period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. For instance, if groceries are paid weekly and the last payment was August 20th, but no payment was entered for August 27th, it will appear under past payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

## Setting Up Subscription Accounts

Like bills, subscriptions are set up under the "Account" section, within "Expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.
1.  Click "New" to add a subscription expense, such as "Amazon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
2.  Classify the expense under "Subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
3.  Set the [[managing_billing_periods_for_subscriptions | payment frequency]], for example, "Quarterly" or "Annual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.
This process also covers [[adding_and_editing_subscription_details | adding and editing subscription details]].

## Entering Subscription Transactions

To record subscription payments, go to the "Transactions" section, under "Expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. This is how you handle [[tracking_subscription_transactions_and_payments | tracking subscription transactions and payments]].
1.  Select the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.
2.  Add a description (e.g., "Amazon subscription") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
3.  Choose the subscription account (e.g., "Amazon") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
4.  Select the payment mode (e.g., "Bank") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
5.  Set the transaction type to "Outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
6.  Enter the payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

## Tracking Subscription Payments

The "Subscription" view under the "Summary" section provides an overview of your subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. It uses the same "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments" logic as bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.
*   **Upcoming Payments:** Shows subscriptions where the next payment due date is in the future relative to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. For example, if a Netflix annual payment was on August 17, 2023, the next payment will be expected on August 17, 2024, and will be shown here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. These can also help in [[automating_subscription_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | automating subscription payment reminders on WhatsApp]] or [[setting_up_bill_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | setting up bill payment reminders on WhatsApp]].
*   **Past Payments:** Indicates subscriptions that had a due date in the past for which no payment has been recorded yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. If an Amazon quarterly payment was made on August 17, 2023, and the frequency is changed to weekly, it would expect a payment on August 24, 2023. If not entered, it would show under "Past Payments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
*   The subscription status (e.g., "Active") is also displayed, supporting [[categorizing_and_viewing_active_and_canceled_subscriptions | categorizing and viewing active and canceled subscriptions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. This status can be manually updated by editing the account properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.

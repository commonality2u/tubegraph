This article outlines how to set up and receive subscription payment reminders directly on WhatsApp, utilizing a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The process is demonstrated by Sanat Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Setting Up a New Reminder

To begin, you will use a database to [[automating_payment_reminder_alerts_using_databases | automate payment reminder alerts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:

1.  **Create a New Template**: Click on the dropdown menu and select the option to [[using_templates_for_subscription_payment_reminders | create a new template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This option is specifically for [[customizing_subscription_reminder_alerts | setting up subscription reminder alerts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  **Input Subscription Details**:
    *   Enter the name of the subscription (e.g., "Spotify") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
    *   Specify the subscription amount (e.g., $150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    *   Click "Background" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A new tablet will be added to your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## [[Creating recurring payment reminders | Creating Recurring Reminders]]

After adding the subscription, you need to set its repetition:

1.  **Access Repeat Options**: Click on the three dots next to the newly added item, then select "Repeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  **Set Repetition Mode**: Choose your desired mode of repetition, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This ensures the reminder for the specified subscription amount repeats monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  **Specify Time and Start Date**: A new window will appear, allowing you to set the exact time and when you want the repetition to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For example, you can set it to repeat every month on the 23rd at 11:56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
4.  **Save**: Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. A repetition arrow will appear, indicating that the reminder will automatically repeat monthly on the specified date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

This setup will automatically add a new line item in your database at the set time and date, triggering the WhatsApp notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Receiving WhatsApp Notifications

Once the reminder is set, you will receive a notification on WhatsApp:

*   The system will automatically add the subscription name to the database at the designated time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   You will then receive a payment reminder notification on your WhatsApp for the specified amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   These notifications will recur monthly on the set date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   The WhatsApp message includes a "pay now" link to facilitate direct payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

> [!example] Example WhatsApp Notification
>
> ```
> [Notification Text Example]
> Payment Reminder: Spotify, $150
> Pay Now: [Link to Payment]
> ```
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>

## Customization

You can [[customizing_payment_alert_messages | customize the reminder alerts]] received on WhatsApp entirely to your preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The template provides instructions and guides to set up this automation on your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

This article outlines how to manage and track your personal savings and investment accounts within a Notion-based personal finance tracker. The system is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of your financial assets and progress towards your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Managing Savings Funds

The tracker allows you to set up and monitor specific savings funds, such as an education fund or a car fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

### Setting Up Savings Accounts

To set up a savings fund:
1.  Navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Assets" part, as savings form a part of your assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
3.  Click the "New" button to add a new savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
4.  Provide a name (e.g., "Car Fund") and classify it under the "Savings" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
5.  Specify a "Goal Amount" for the fund by editing the account details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. This will enable the display of the total amount saved and the percentage achieved towards the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

### Adding Savings Transactions

To add contributions to your savings funds:
1.  Navigate to the "Transactions" view and select the "Asset" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
2.  Click "New" to create a new transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
3.  Enter a description (e.g., "Car Fund savings") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
4.  Select the relevant savings account (e.g., "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
5.  Choose your payment mode (e.g., "Bank") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
6.  Set the transaction type as "Outflow," as money is moving from your primary account to the savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
7.  Enter the amount you are contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

### Tracking Savings Progress
Contributions are reflected in the "Savings" section under the summary view, showing the total amount saved and the percentage of the goal achieved for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. This provides a clear overview of your [[tracking_contributions_and_progress_of_emergency_savings | progress of emergency savings]] and other savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Tracking and Managing Investments

The tracker includes an "Investment" tab to help you track various investments such as stocks and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

### Overview of the Investment Tab
The Investment tab provides an [[investment_tracking_and_dashboard_analysis | investment tracking and dashboard analysis]], displaying:
*   The total amount invested in each category (e.g., stocks, crypto) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   The number of units held for each investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
*   Profit or loss incurred from transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   The percentage each investment contributes to the total investment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

### Setting Up Investment Accounts
To set up investment accounts:
1.  Navigate to the "Accounts" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.
2.  Add a new investment account (e.g., "Apple Investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
3.  Specify an opening balance and opening units if applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
4.  Classify the investment (e.g., "Stocks" or "Crypto") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>, which helps in [[organizing_investments_into_categories | organizing investments into categories]].
5.  Crucially, set the "Asset Class" to "Investments" to ensure accurate calculation of your total investment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.

### Adding Investment Transactions
To record [[adding_and_managing_investment_transactions | investment transactions]]:
1.  Go to the "Transactions" section and select the "Assets" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
2.  Create a new transaction for a purchase or sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.
3.  Input the date, description, account, payment mode, and transaction type (inflow for purchase, outflow for sale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.

### Key Principle for Investment Transactions
*   **Purchases:** Always record the investment amount at its *cost price* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Sales:** When selling an investment, record the *cost value* of the units being sold, not the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. This method allows the tracker to correctly compute the profit or loss on the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. You can specify the units sold and the market price to calculate the total sales value and corresponding profit/loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.

> [!info] Note
> The system tracks the "total value of units available" at the end of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. The investment tab automatically computes profit or loss based on the cost value recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

The overall tracker allows for detailed [[managing_funds_and_balance_tracking | managing funds and balance tracking]], including investments, and contributes to the overall [[setting_financial_goals_and_net_worth_tracking | net worth tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

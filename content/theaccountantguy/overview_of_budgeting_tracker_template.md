This budgeting tracker is a comprehensive template designed to help fulfill various budgeting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It offers an [[managing_budget_and_expenditure_overview | overview]] of financial components and tracking capabilities.

## Core Components

The budgeting tracker integrates five primary components to manage finances:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

For each component, users can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For instance, income has a goal amount, and expenses allow for setting a budget amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. As expenses are incurred, the tracker automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Key Features

### Budget Tracking and Status

The template displays the percentage of the budgeted amount that has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Below this percentage, a budget status indicates whether expenses have exceeded or remained within the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This feature is consistent across all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Component Overviews

On the left side of the interface, a drop-down menu provides an [[budget_summary_and_tracking | overview]] of each financial component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. For example, selecting "income overview" shows all added income categories, their specific amounts, goal amounts, and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This [[income_and_expense_tracking_with_budget_targets | income and expense tracking with budget targets]] system is a compilation across all months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Transaction Input

Transactions are entered via "quick buttons" located below the main overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Clicking an "income" or "expense" button automatically creates a new entry for the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Input fields for transactions include:
*   **Detail** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   **Month and Year**: Users can type in the month and year, which automatically updates the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Category**: Specific categories for income or expense sources can be entered and edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Code**: A unique code tracks the source of income or expense, helping to collate data across different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount**: Set at the start of the month for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount**: The incurred income or expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Monthly Overview and Dynamic Filtering

A monthly [[budget_summary_and_tracking | summary]] is available at the bottom, providing a month-wise division of financial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. New months are automatically added as data is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

The template also supports dynamic filtering, allowing users to filter data for a particular year or month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This means users can view all values for a specific year or a specific month across all years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Funds Balance

A "funds balance" view shows the income and spending for each month, along with the remaining balance at the end of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This provides a quick glance at the account status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The balance updates automatically as income and expenses are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Customization
*   **Currency**: The currency can be changed from dollars to any other preferred currency within the number format options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

This template aims to solve all general budgeting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

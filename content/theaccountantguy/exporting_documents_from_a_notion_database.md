This article details the process of [[generating_pdf_documents_using_notion | generating PDF documents]] from a [[setting_up_and_managing_notion_databases_for_pdf_generation | Notion database]], specifically using boarding passes as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Overview
The process involves using a [[setting_up_and_managing_notion_databases_for_pdf_generation | Notion database]] containing specific details and a corresponding template to [[pdf_document_creation_with_notion_and_pdf_output | generate PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The tool used for this is referred to as "PDF output" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Process for Generating PDF Documents

1.  **Prepare Notion Assets**:
    *   A "boarding pass database" should be set up in Notion, containing all the necessary details for the boarding passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
    *   A "boarding pass template" is required, from which the PDF will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

2.  **Connect to PDF Output Tool**:
    *   In the connection details, specify "boarding pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
    *   Connect the relevant [[setting_up_and_connecting_notion_database_for_pdf_creation | Notion database]] by typing "boarding pass database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
    *   Select the "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

3.  **Load and Export Data**:
    *   The system will begin loading information from both the [[integrating_notion_database_with_pdf_output | Notion database]] and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    *   Once the information is fully loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, select the "export" option to initiate the [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database_rows | generation of PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Results

After a successful export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:
*   A "preview sample" can be accessed to confirm that the boarding pass has been generated with all the details from the [[using_notion_database_as_an_invoice_source | Notion database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   The generated PDF files can be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   The downloaded files can be extracted and opened to view the individual PDF outputs, each with potentially different names and contexts if multiple records were exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

This method allows for the efficient [[using_notion_for_generating_pdf_documents | generation of PDF documents]] from [[generating_pdf_documents_using_notion_databases | Notion databases]] using a dedicated PDF output tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

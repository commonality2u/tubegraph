This guide provides an overview of how to utilize a business cash flow template to [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | track your cash flow]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>

## Cash Flow Overview

The cash flow overview section provides a summary of your financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Key metrics include:
*   **Opening Balance**: The initial cash balance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   **Total Inflow**: The total cash received from all transactions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   **Cash Outflow**: The total cash disbursed through all transactions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Closing Balance**: The final cash balance, which updates automatically as transactions are entered. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

## Key Sections

On the right side of the template, there are three primary sections: Account, Quarterly Overview, and Business Activity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

### Account Section

This section allows you to set up and manage different accounts under various heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

*   **Assets**: Pre-specified assets include cash, bank, receivables, input taxes, and other receivables. You can add your own or edit existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. To edit an asset, click the pencil icon and enter the preferred name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**: This is the starting balance of an asset when you begin using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Classifications**: Categorize items (e.g., credit card as debt, quarterly income as quarterly payment frequency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. You can add new classifications or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: Define how often payments are received for specific items, useful for tracking income and expenses (e.g., interest income as quarterly payment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**: Relevant for investments or inventory, allowing you to specify the initial number of units (e.g., 10 units with a balance of 1300) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Asset Class**: Used for inventory (inventory asset class) or investments (investment asset class) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The same principles for adding and editing items apply to liabilities, income, and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. To add a new item, click "new" under the respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### [[overview_of_quarterly_cash_flow_and_business_activities | Quarterly Overview]]

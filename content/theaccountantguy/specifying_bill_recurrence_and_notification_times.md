This guide demonstrates how to set up recurring bill payment reminders on your [[setting_up_whatsapp_bill_payment_reminders | WhatsApp]] using a template system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This method allows for easy tracking and notification of upcoming bill payments, such as for a Wi-Fi bill due on September 20th for $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Setting Up a New Bill Reminder

To create a new bill payment reminder and [[steps_for_scheduling_payment_reminders_with_repetition | schedule payment reminders with repetition]]:
1.  Click on the provided drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Select "New template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the name of your bill, for example, "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
4.  Specify the bill amount, such as $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
5.  Click "Back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Setting Recurrence and Notification Times

After creating the bill:
1.  Click the drop-down menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots next to the bill entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Set the bill to repeat on a recurring basis, selecting "Every month" for monthly bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time and day you wish to receive the notification, for instance, at 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This setup ensures you receive a WhatsApp notification at the specified time monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation and Notifications

This system relies on automation, often facilitated by tools like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Once the automation is configured and the template is set to recur, notifications are automatically sent to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. An example showed a "Mobile bill" being automatically added and a notification sent to WhatsApp, arriving within approximately one minute of the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This demonstrates how you can effectively use [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | templates to automate bill payment reminders]].

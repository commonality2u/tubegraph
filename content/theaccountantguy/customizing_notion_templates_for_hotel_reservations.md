A Notion template is available for [[hotel_booking_tracking_using_notion_template | tracking hotel bookings]] and managing guest reservations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template is designed to help users keep track of various details related to hotel stays.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The template features two main KPI sections at the top to provide a quick overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:

*   **Bookings by Room Type** Shows the number of bookings made for different room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Underneath each room type, the number of guests who have booked that particular room is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests** Indicates how many guests have requested free pickup services (Yes/No) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Guest Booking Tracker Table

At the bottom of the template, a simple table allows for detailed entry of guest information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:

*   **Guest Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Email ID** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   **Contact Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **Special Request** A placeholder text field for any specific guest needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Arrival Date** Records the guest's arrival date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Departure Date** Records the guest's departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Room Type** A selection field for the specific room type booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Guest Count** The number of guests included in the reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup** A Yes/No option to indicate if free pickup is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Customization Options for the Notion Template

The template offers several options for [[customizing_notion_templates | customizing Notion templates]] to fit specific needs:

*   **Adding Time to Dates** Users can include time details for both arrival and departure dates by clicking on the date property and selecting "include time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Managing Room Types**
    *   Pre-defined room types are available for selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   New room types can be easily added by typing them directly into the "Room type" column, which automatically creates a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   The icon for a new room type can be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   Changing a room type in the table automatically updates the KPIs at the top, demonstrating two-way synchronization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Adding Guest Count to KPIs** While the guest count is present in the table, it is not displayed in the top KPIs by default. This can be added through further [[customizing_notion_templates | customization of the template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

The template is fully [[customizing_notion_templates | customizable]] to meet specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>. Entering details at the bottom of the table automatically reflects them in the KPIs at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:46">[03:00:46]</a>.

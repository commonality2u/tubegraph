The personal finance tracker includes a dedicated "Debt Payment Report" tab designed to help users monitor and manage their debts effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This section allows individuals to track total debts, interest and principal paid, and remaining outstanding loan amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This feature is crucial for [[managing_debt_and_loan_repayments | managing debt and loan repayments]] and offers a comprehensive overview of your financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## How to Set Up Debt Information

To begin [[tracking_debt_repayments_and_progress | tracking debt repayments and progress]], users need to input specific debt information:
*   **Debt Information:** Add details about each debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Loan Amount:** Specify the total loan taken for a particular debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate:** Enter the applicable interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Minimum EMI Payment:** Set the minimum EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) payment to be made each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This helps in [[setting_up_repayment_schedules | setting up repayment schedules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Additional Down Payment:** Record any down payment made at the time of obtaining the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Initial Repayment Date:** Input the first date a repayment was made towards the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Automatic Calculations

Once the initial data is entered, the tracker automatically calculates several key figures, providing a clear [[understanding_debt_overview_and_summary | understanding of your debt overview and summary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>:
*   **Loan Outstanding at Beginning:** Computes the initial outstanding loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Debt-Free Date:** Estimates when the debt will be paid off if minimum repayments continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Interest Repaid:** Shows the cumulative interest paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Principal Repaid:** Displays the cumulative principal amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Total Repayment Value:** The sum of interest and principal repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Repayment Percentage:** The percentage of the loan that has been repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Logging Debt Repayments

On the right side of the "Debt Payment" tab, users can log individual repayment transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. For each entry, specify the date and choose the relevant debt from a dropdown list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. After entering the EMI amount, the tracker automatically computes the interest value, principal value, and updates the loan outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

For instance, if a student loan payment of $3,850 is entered for January 31st, the system will reflect the interest and principal components of that payment, and the loan outstanding will be automatically reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This dynamic update system ensures accurate [[tracking_debt_payoff_progress | tracking of debt payoff progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

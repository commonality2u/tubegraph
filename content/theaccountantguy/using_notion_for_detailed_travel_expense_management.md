This article details how to utilize a [[setting_up_a_travel_expense_tracker_in_notion | travel expense tracker]] in [[using_notion_for_budgeting | Notion]] to manage and plan for travel expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template is designed to help users keep track of all travel-related expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Overview of the Tracker

The [[using_notion_as_an_expense_tracker | expense tracker]] is divided into three main sections:
*   **Accounts**: For setting up expense categories and their budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: Displays incurred expenses against budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Overall Summary**: Provides a high-level overview of all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Setting Up Accounts and Budgeted Amounts

The "Accounts" view allows for classifying expenses into categories like Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
For each category, you can set a budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

#### Adding and Editing Expense Sources
*   **Adding New Expense Sources**: Click the "Add expense source" button to automatically add a new source under the "Travel" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. You can then modify its name (e.g., "Metro") and set a budgeted amount (e.g., $1,500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Moving Expense Sources**: An expense source can be moved to a different category (e.g., "Meals") by clicking the three dots next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Sources**: Click the pencil icon to edit the details of an already added expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

#### Adding New Categories
To add a completely new expense category or group, click the plus sign on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Existing groups can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Understanding the Expenses View

The "Expenses" view shows the total amount incurred for each expense source, the budgeted amount set for it, and the percentage of the budget spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Exceeded Budget**: If actual expenses exceed the budget (e.g., a $2,000 flight against a $1,000 budget), the percentage (200%) is indicated in red, signifying overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Within Budget**: If expenses are within the budget (e.g., $100 for breakfast against a $300 budget), the percentage (33%) is shown in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

This view provides a quick glance at where your expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Overall Summary

The "Summary" section gives a complete overview of the total budgeted expense, total incurred expense, and the difference between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. It also calculates the total percentage of budgeted expense that has been spent (e.g., 59%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Booking Travel Expenses

Expenses are classified under three categories: Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Quick addition buttons are available for each category to easily book expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Steps to Book an Expense:
1.  **Select Category**: Click on the "Add travel expense," "Add meals expense," or "Add lodging expense" button depending on the type of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This automatically adds a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
2.  **Add Description**: Enter a description for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
3.  **Trip Info**: Specify the trip details (e.g., "Trip to Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This can be edited via the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
4.  **Select Account (Expense Source)**: Choose the specific expense source from the predefined list (e.g., Bus, Metro, Train, Flight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
5.  **Enter Amount**: Input the amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it updates the "Expenses" summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. If a budgeted amount is set for that expense source, the system will reflect how much of the budget has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

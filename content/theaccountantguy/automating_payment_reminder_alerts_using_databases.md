This article details how to [[creating_recurring_payment_reminders | set up recurring payment reminders]] and receive notifications directly on WhatsApp using a database system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Setting Up WhatsApp Subscription Payment Reminders

The process involves configuring reminders through a database, which then sends the messages to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Steps to Create a New Template

1.  **Access Template Options**: Click on the dropdown menu within the database interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
2.  **Create New Template**: Select the option to create a new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This provides an option for [[using_templates_for_subscription_payment_reminders | setting up a subscription reminder alert]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
3.  **Specify Subscription Details**: Input the name of the subscription (e.g., Spotify) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> and the subscription amount (e.g., $150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. After inputting details, click "background" or "Done" to add the new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Setting Repetition for Reminders

Once the template is added:
1.  **Access Repetition Settings**: Click on the three dots next to the newly added template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  **Set Repeat Mode**: Click on "repeat" and select the desired repetition frequency, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This ensures the reminder for the specified subscription amount repeats monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  **Configure Time and Date**: A new window will open to specify the exact time and date for the reminder to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For example, a reminder can be set for 11:56 AM on the 23rd of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
4.  **Save Settings**: After configuring, click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. A repetition arrow will indicate that the reminder is set to automatically repeat every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Receiving WhatsApp Notifications

Once the reminder is set, the system will automatically add a new line item in the database at the specified time and date each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Subsequently, a notification alert will be automatically received on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Notification Content

The WhatsApp notification will typically include:
*   A payment reminder for the specific subscription and amount (e.g., Spotify $150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   A "pay now" link to facilitate direct payment of the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Customization and Benefits

The reminder alerts received on WhatsApp are fully customizable to meet individual requirements, meaning there is no fixed template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This automation helps users [[benefits_of_automated_payment_reminders_for_timely_payments | pay subscription amounts on time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Instructions and a guide are provided with the template to help users set up the automation independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

This Notion-based tracker is designed to help businesses keep all their expenses organized under a single general ledger (GL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It simplifies [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | expense tracking]] and [[budgeting_and_tracking_in_notion | budgeting]] by providing a centralized system for [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]].

## Key Features

### Expense Categories
The tracker includes expense categories where you can define different expenses your business incurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

*   **Defining and Managing Categories**:
    *   Some predefined business expense categories are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
    *   Categories can be modified or changed by clicking on them and selecting "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
    *   Subcategories can be edited by clicking on the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
    *   New categories can be added by clicking "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

*   **Setting Budgeted Amounts**:
    *   For each category, you can set a budgeted amount for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    *   These budgeted amounts will automatically reflect in the expenses overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, changing an advertising budget from $100 to $5,000 updates the overview automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

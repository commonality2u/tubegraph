The accounts receivable and payable tracker includes a "transaction section" designed for organizing financial entries by specific periods, including quarters [03:09]. This section is divided into three main segments: receivable, payable, and quarterly summary [03:14].

## Transaction Segments

### Receivable Transactions
In the receivable segment, users can input various details for each transaction, including the date of the invoice [03:23]. A key feature is the ability to specify the period for which the transaction is raised [03:24]. Users can select one of four predefined quarterly periods from a dropdown menu [03:26]. Once these details, along with the description, account name, amount, and invoice number, are entered, the information automatically updates across the tracker [03:44]. For instance, an invoice created for a customer like Harry for $150 is reflected in the receivable section and other relevant areas [03:51]. Transactions within this section are automatically bated by month, with later months appearing at the top, and a number indicates the count of transactions for each month [04:40].

### Payable Transactions
Similar to the receivable segment, the payable section also allows for detailed entry of transactions [04:03]. Users can record the date, invoice number, status, and amount for each payable invoice [02:31]. The paid status can be marked with a checkbox, which affects the reflection of the amount in total balances [04:11]. Quick action buttons are available to add new receivable or payable entries, automatically populating the current date and relevant details for quick input [04:24].

## Quarterly Summary
The "quarterly summary" section provides an overall summary of all transactions carried out across different quarters [05:08]. For each quarter, it displays the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance (receivable minus payable) [05:13].

For example, by sliding a toggle, users can view specific quarterly data [05:22]. In the third quarter, if the total receivable is $1,150 (sum of $150 and $1,000) and the total payable is $250, the net balance displayed would be $900 [05:28]. This section offers a [[quarterly_overview_of_cash_flow | quarterly overview]] of financial activity, summarizing what is happening on both the receivable and payable sides [05:48]. The total amounts across all quarters are also reflected at the top of this summary [05:44].

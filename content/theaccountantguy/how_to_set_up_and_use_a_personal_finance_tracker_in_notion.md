The Notion personal finance tracker offers a comprehensive system to manage your financial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is structured into several key sections to provide a complete overview of your finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Core Sections of the Tracker

The tracker is primarily organized into three main sections:

*   **Account Section**: Where you define different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, including opening balances, payment frequency, and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Summary Section**: Provides an at-a-glance view of all your finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Within the summary, there are specific views for:

*   **Subscription**: Tracks subscription statuses and payment dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Net Worth**: Gives a total overview of your achieved net worth and how much you are lagging behind your target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Transaction Section**: Where all income, expense, asset, or liability transactions are fed, affecting all other sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Tracking Net Worth

To track your net worth, which is the difference between assets and liabilities, follow these steps:

### Setting a Net Worth Goal
First, go to the **Net Worth Goal section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
*   Specify your target net worth for the financial year (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. You can easily change this value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

### Viewing Net Worth Summary
Navigate to the **Net Worth section** under the **Summary** view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Goal**: Displays your set target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: This is automatically calculated as (Assets - Liabilities) from all recorded transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. For example, if total assets are $5,630 and liabilities are $1,300, the net worth is $4,330 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.
*   **Difference**: Shows how much you are lagging behind your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved**: Reflects the percentage of your net worth goal achieved (Total Net Worth / Net Worth Goal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **Total Growth**: This is the difference between your closing net worth (current) and your opening net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. The opening net worth is derived from the opening balances of assets and liabilities specified in the Account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. For instance, if opening assets were $1,900 and liabilities $900, the opening net worth was $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

## Tracking Investments

This section covers [[setting up an investment portfolio tracker in Notion|setting up an investment portfolio tracker in Notion]].

### Setting Up Investment Accounts
To track investments, navigate to the **Accounts tab** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. Investments are considered assets.
*   **Adding Investments**:
    *   Add an investment account (e.g., "Apple Investment," "Bitcoin Investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
    *   Specify the "Opening Balance" at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
    *   **Classification**: Classify the investment (e.g., "Stocks," "Crypto"). You can create new classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.
    *   **Opening Units**: Enter the number of units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
    *   **Asset Class**: Crucially, set the "Asset Class" to "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>. This is vital for the tracker to calculate the total value of investments in the dedicated investment tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

### Recording Investment Transactions
Investment transactions are recorded in the **Transactions > Asset section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Purchases**: Always record purchases at the **cost price** in the "Amount" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
    *   Example: 50 units of Apple stock at $10/unit, total value $500. The "Amount" should be $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.
*   **Sales**: When selling an investment, record the **cost value of the units being sold** in the "Amount" field, NOT the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.
    *   Example: Selling 30 units that were purchased at $10/unit. The "Amount" should be $300 (30 units x $10 cost price), even if sold for $40/unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.
    *   Recording the cost value of sold units allows the tracker to compute profit or loss on the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.

### Tracking Investment Overview
The **Investment tab** provides an overview of your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
*   It shows total investment amounts and the number of units available for each investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.
*   It displays profit or loss made from transactions (positive for profit, negative for loss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   It also shows the investment percentage, indicating each investment's proportion of the total investment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

## Couples Tracking Finances

The dashboard is applicable for couples who want to [[managing finances with Notion|manage finances with Notion]] together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.
*   In the **Account section**, you can split different categories of accounts (income, expenses, assets, liabilities) by individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.
*   For example, you can name income accounts "Salary by Him" and "Side Hustle by Her" to denote who earned it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   This allows couples to easily track everything while distinguishing individual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

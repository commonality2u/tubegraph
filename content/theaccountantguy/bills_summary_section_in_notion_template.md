The [[creating_a_bills_tracker_in_notion | Bills Tracker in Notion]] includes a dedicated [[using_the_summary_section_in_notion_expense_tracker | summary section]] to provide a concise overview of bill statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This section displays all bills with their relevant details, such as the amount due, the due date, the number of days remaining until payment, and the current payment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. When a bill's status is updated, for example, by clicking a checkbox, it automatically reflects under the "Bills Paid" subsection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Components of the Summary Section

The [[using_the_summary_section_in_notion_expense_tracker | summary section]] within the [[notion_bills_tracker_dashboard_overview | Notion Bills Tracker]] template is divided into three key subsections:

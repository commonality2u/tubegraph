Sanat Biswal, also known as "The Accountant Guy," demonstrates how to use a Notion template specifically designed to [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | track all tax payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This template provides a clear overview of tax liabilities through a quarterly tax payment section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

The top section of the template offers a tax payment summary, displaying three primary components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>:

### Accounts
This area is where you [[setting_up_notion_for_personal_finance_tracking | set up]] all your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources** are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources** allow for availing input tax credit to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The template initially includes "Services" and "Goods" as revenue sources and "Purchases" as an expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. New revenue or expense sources can be added using the "Quick Action" buttons on the left, such as "Add Revenue Source" or "Add Expense Source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A pencil icon allows for feeding in specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The count of revenue and expense sources updates automatically as they are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Financials
This section enables [[tracking_income_and_expenses_using_notion | tracking of all revenue and expense amounts]], along with corresponding tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
For instance, if $2000 in services revenue is entered, with a 10% tax rate, the total tax payable of $200 is reflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Similarly, input taxes from purchases are displayed, such as $10 from initial example transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. All figures in this section update automatically once details are fed into the transactions view at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes
This section displays the total tax payments due for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For each quarter, it shows:
*   Taxes Payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Input Tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Tax Liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

For example, if all current revenue and expense transactions relate to Quarter 3, the updated figures for taxes payable, input tax, and tax liability will be reflected specifically in Quarter 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Transaction Section

After [[setting_up_notion_for_personal_finance_tracking | setting up]] revenue and expense sources, individual transactions can be entered in the section below the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Transactions are categorized into "Revenue" and "Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Adding Revenue Transactions
1.  Click the "Add Revenue" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
2.  A new line item automatically appears with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
3.  Select the **Period** (e.g., September falls in Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
4.  Select the relevant **Account** (e.g., Goods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
5.  Enter the **Amount** (e.g., $1000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
6.  Input the **Tax Rate** (e.g., 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
7.  The "Tax Payable" is automatically calculated (e.g., $80), and this immediately updates the quarterly taxes and overall tax liability at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions
1.  Click the "Add Expense" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  A new expense line item is added with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
3.  Fill in details similar to revenue transactions: **Period** (e.g., Quarter 3), **Account** (e.g., Purchases), **Amount** (e.g., $500), and **Tax Rate** (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
4.  The "Input Credit" is calculated (e.g., $50), and the total input credit and overall tax liability update at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The template may take a moment to reflect the final updated tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Profit/Loss Section
At the bottom of the template, there is a profit/loss section which provides a quick overview of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. It shows:
*   Total Revenue earned from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Total Expenses booked so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   The overall Profit made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>

This comprehensive tax payment tracker simplifies the process of managing and understanding your tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

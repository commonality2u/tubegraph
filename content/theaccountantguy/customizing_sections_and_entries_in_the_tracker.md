The [[payments_tracker | customer payments tracker]] is a simple template designed to help users keep track of customer payments in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template is entirely [[customizing_notion_templates | customizable]] to fit specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Template Sections Overview

The tracker is divided into several key sections:

*   **Summary Section**: Located on the left side, this section provides a quick overview of financial metrics. It displays the total payment due, the amount of payment received, the difference between these two figures, and the percentage of total payments received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **Main Sections (Right Side)**: On the right, there are three primary sections:
    *   **Customer Section**: Used for setting up and managing the entire customer database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
    *   **Overview Section**: Displays summarized payment information, including total payment received, payment due, and the percentage of payment received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   **Transaction Section**: Where individual payment transactions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Customizing the Customer Section

The customer section allows for detailed organization and management of your customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Managing Subsections

The customer section is pre-divided into three subset sections: "Regular," "Seasonal," and "Occasional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

*   **Editing Subsections**: To edit any existing subsection, simply click on it and begin editing the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Adding New Subsections**: To add additional subsections, click the plus icon within the customer section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Managing Customer Entries

Under each subsection, individual customer entries are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Each customer entry displays the total payment amount that is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

*   **Editing Payment Amount**: To change the total payment amount due for a customer, click on the amount and enter the new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Editing Customer Name**: The customer name can be edited by clicking on the pencil icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Adding New Customers**: New customer names can be added to the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Deleting Customers**: Customers can be deleted by clicking on the three-dot menu icon next to their entry and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

The transaction section is crucial for updating the overall payment status. Users can enter various details for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>:

*   **Date**: The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Description**: A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Customer Name**: Select the customer name from a list of existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The payment amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Document Section**: An option to attach specific invoices related to the customer transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Once these transaction details are filled, the payment received amount in the overview section automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For example, if a transaction value is changed, the received payment figures will adjust accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

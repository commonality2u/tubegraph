The "Emergency Funds Setup" template in Notion helps users track their emergency funds effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This template is designed by An Biswal, also known as "The Accountant Guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The template features three main sections for comprehensive tracking:
*   **Fund Setup** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Savings Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Summary Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

## Fund Setup

The Fund Setup section allows users to define and organize their emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Categories
Funds are initially categorized into three types:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

Users can edit these existing categories or add new ones to suit their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. New categories can be added by clicking "add a group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Adding a New Fund
To add a new emergency fund, click the "add font button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A new fund will automatically appear under the "no classification tab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This new fund can then be moved to its respective category (e.g., Financial Safety) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Fund Details
Each fund can be configured with specific details by clicking the pencil icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Key fields include:
*   **Fund Detail**: A descriptive name for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance**: The initial amount available for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: The targeted savings amount for the emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Start Date**: The date when contributions to the fund begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Target End Date**: The date by which the total emergency fund is intended to be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The template automatically calculates the amount of savings made to date based on the contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Fund names can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Contributions Section

This section is where users log money deposited into their emergency savings funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Organizing Contributions
Contributions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. It also shows the number of contributions made for each specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Contribution Fields
Each entry includes:
*   **Date**: The specific date of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief note about the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Period**: The month and year of the contribution (e.g., March 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

*   **Amount**: The sum of money being contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Contribution Requirement and Status
A "Requirement" column shows how much contribution is needed each month to meet the targeted goal amount by the set end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   If the entered amount meets or exceeds the required amount, a tick mark or check mark appears, indicating the requirement has been met for that month and fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   If the contribution is less than the requirement, no tick mark appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Quick Action Button

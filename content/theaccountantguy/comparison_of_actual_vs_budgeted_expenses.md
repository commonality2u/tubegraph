A business budget template can be utilized to compare actual expenses against budgeted amounts, providing a clear overview of financial performance and aiding in [[managing_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | managing budgeted versus actual expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This template typically includes sections for accounts, expenses, and a summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Setting Up Budgeted Amounts

Within the "Account" section of the template, users can define various [[expense_categories_and_budget_updates | expense categories]] under broad heads such as Operational, Administration, or Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The system allows for adding entirely new categories or editing existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Once these categories are established, [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | budgeted amounts]] can be specified for each head of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Tracking and Comparing Expenses

The "Expenses" section provides a real-time comparison of current expenses against the predetermined budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This section automatically updates as transactions are recorded in the dedicated transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Key indicators within this section include:
*   **Over-budget expenses**: Indicated in red, showing a high percentage relative to the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Within-budget expenses**: Indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Summary of Performance

The "Summary" section offers a consolidated view of the overall financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It reflects:
*   The total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   The total expenses incurred to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   The difference between the total budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   The percentage of the total budgeted expense that has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

This comprehensive [[budget_and_actual_expenses_comparison | budget and actual expenses comparison]] helps businesses stay within their financial targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Transaction Entry

The "Transaction" section is crucial for [[budgeted_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | tracking budgeted versus actual expenses]] by allowing users to record individual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Transactions are typically organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Users can quickly add expenses by using dedicated buttons for different categories, such as an "operational expense" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Upon clicking, it automatically inputs the current date, allowing the user to add a description, associate the expense with a relevant account, and enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Dates can be adjusted if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This feature facilitates efficient [[monthly_budget_tracking | monthly budget tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Additionally, buttons are available at the top of the template to quickly add a new expense source or a new account under existing categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This allows for continuous [[expense_analysis_and_budgeting | expense analysis and budgeting]] and helps maintain the accuracy of [[budget_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | budget versus actual expenses tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

This article details how to utilize the subscription expenses tracker to [[introduction_to_subscription_expenses_tracker | track subscription expenses]], focusing on how to add and modify subscription entries and their associated payment details. The tracker allows users to categorize, monitor, and manage their various subscriptions effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Subscription Overview and Categorization
The tracker features a subscription overview section that provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Subscriptions are organized under "active" and "canceled" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Underneath each category, you will find:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   The total expenses incurred for that subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   The billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Modifying Billing Periods
The billing period can be changed by clicking on the existing period, which reveals various options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While it is possible to change the name of the billing period, it is recommended not to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. You can select any billing period as per your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Expenses Section
The expenses section divides subscriptions into different categories such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Categories (Groups)
*   **Adding a New Group**: Click on the plus icon to add a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Groups**: Click on an existing group to change its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Each classification in this section displays the subscription name, total expenses, and its percentage contribution to the total subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Quick Subscription Addition
A "quick action button" labeled "add subscription" is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Clicking this button automatically adds a new subscription, which initially appears under a "note subscription category" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Moving and Editing New Entries
*   **Moving**: Click on the three dots next to the newly added subscription to move it to any classification of your choice, such as "active mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Editing Details**: Click on the pencil icon to [[adding_and_editing_employee_and_payment_details | edit the details]] of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This acts as a quick addition button for subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Transaction Section for Expense Tracking
The transaction section is where you input all the details to book subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It features views for "active subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> and "canceled subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top, along with the total sum of expenses incurred for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Adding and Modifying Transaction Details
To add or modify a subscription transaction:
1.  **Status**: Use the checkbox to indicate if the subscription is currently active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Subscription Account**: Select the subscription account from a list pulled from the subscriptions added in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  **Billing Period**: This value is automatically pulled from the billing period set at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  **Payment Date**: Click and choose any date for the subscription payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
5.  **Amount**: Enter the amount of the subscription expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
6.  **Renewal Date**: The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the entered payment date and the set billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, a Netflix subscription paid on September 30 with a monthly billing period will have a next renewal date of October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This applies to annual and weekly subscriptions as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Canceling a Subscription
To cancel a subscription, simply click the checkbox in the transaction section. This action automatically changes its status to "canceled," which is then reflected in the overview section as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Quick Transaction Addition
You can quickly add a new subscription transaction by clicking "space subscription," which automatically adds a new entry, allowing you to input the details as required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Customization
The tracker also includes a quick tutorial on how to change the currency displayed in the dashboard, allowing users to select different currencies as per their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

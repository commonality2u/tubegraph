Notion offers a small business bookkeeping template designed to help manage financial data, providing an overview of transactions, expenses, income, and overall financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This template is divided into three main sections: "Start Here," "Summary," and "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Template Setup: "Start Here" Section

The "Start Here" section is where initial business information and accounts are configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Account Setup
This section includes predefined categories such as expenses, liabilities, income, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Examples of accounts under these heads include:
*   **Expenses:** Purchase expense, utility bills, subscription, salaries and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   **Liabilities:** Accounts payable, taxes payable, accrued expenses, credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

Users can edit, delete, or add new accounts within these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Account Details
For each account, the following details can be set:
*   **Opening Balance:** Allows for carrying forward balances, particularly for liabilities and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Classification:** Accounts can be classified as bills, debt, or savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. For example, utility bills are classified as "bills," and subscriptions as "subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency:** Applicable for recurring payments (e.g., monthly, half-yearly, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Opening Units:** Used for tracking starting units of inventory or assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Asset Class:** Assets can be categorized as either "inventory" or "investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Transaction Entry

The "Transactions" window is where all business transactions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Users can add income, expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

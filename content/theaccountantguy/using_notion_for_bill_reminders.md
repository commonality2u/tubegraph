Sanat Biswal, also known as "The Accountant Guy," demonstrates how to set up bill payment reminders that are sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This system leverages [[Using Notion for personal finance management | Notion]] for tracking and an automation tool for sending notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Setting Up a New Bill Reminder

The process begins by creating a new entry in a [[Notion template setup for invoice reminders | Notion template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   An example Wi-Fi bill shows a due date of September 20th and a payment amount of $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   To create a new reminder:
    1.  Click on the drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
    2.  Select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
    3.  Enter the bill name, such as "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
    4.  Specify the bill amount, for instance, $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    5.  Click "back" to save the entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Setting Recurring Bill Reminders

Once a bill is entered, it can be set to recur automatically:
1.  Click the drop-down menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click the three dots next to the bill entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Set the bill to repeat on a recurring basis, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time for the notification, for example, 11:55 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Set the specific day of the month for the reminder, such as the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
6.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once saved, the system will automatically send a notification to WhatsApp at the specified time and day each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation Setup with Pabbly Connect

For the notifications to be sent to WhatsApp, the system integrates with an automation tool called Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   The entire automation setup in Pabbly Connect is provided and explained in a downloadable template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Once this automation is configured, notifications will be automatically sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Receiving WhatsApp Notifications

After setting up the recurring template and automation:
*   A new bill will automatically appear in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Subsequently, a notification will be sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Notifications are typically received within one minute of the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

This system allows for automatic, recurring bill reminders directly to WhatsApp for every bill added through the [[Notion template setup for invoice reminders | Notion template]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

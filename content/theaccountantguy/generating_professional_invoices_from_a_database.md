This article explains how to [[generating_professional_invoice_pdfs | generate professional invoices]] directly from a [[using_notion_database_as_an_invoice_source | Notion database]] using the [[generating_pdf_invoices_using_pdfoutput | PDFoutput]] tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This process leverages [[using_templates_and_databases_to_create_professional_pdfs | templates and databases]] to automate [[bulk_pdf_invoice_generation | bulk PDF invoice generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Components for Invoice Generation

### Invoice Template
An invoice template serves as the layout for the final PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Placeholders:** Key information fields, such as client name, client company, client address, city, state, and zip, are indicated by placeholder text enclosed in curly braces (e.g., `{client name}`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** These placeholders are designed to be replaced by data from a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Example Template:** A "professional invoice template" is used in this demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Database
A database, such as a [[using_notion_database_as_an_invoice_source | Notion database]], stores the specific details for each invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Columns:** It contains various columns corresponding to the template's placeholders, such as `client name`, `amount`, `bank name`, `client address`, and `client company` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Population:** For every row of information in the database, a corresponding PDF will be generated by populating the template with that row's data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Example Database:** A "professional invoice database" is used as the data source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Generating PDFs using PDFoutput

The process involves connecting the [[using_notion_database_as_an_invoice_source | Notion database]] and [[creating_professional_invoice_templates_in_notion | Notion template]] within the [[generating_pdf_invoices_using_pdfoutput | PDFoutput]] interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Initial Setup
1.  **Log In:** Access the [[generating_pdf_invoices_using_pdfoutput | PDFoutput]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  **API Keys:** Navigate to the "Help" section (by clicking 'H') to complete the steps required for enabling API keys. This is crucial for integrating with external services like [[using_notion_for_invoice_generation | Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Defining the Connection
1.  **Connection Name:** Provide a name for the connection, such as "invoice generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
2.  **Select Database:** Choose the specific database from the dropdown menu (e.g., "professional invoice database") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  **Select Template:** Similarly, select the corresponding template (e.g., "professional invoice template") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
4.  **Proceed:** Click "Next" to load and map the elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### [[mapping_database_elements_to_invoice_templates | Mapping Database Elements to Invoice Templates]]
[[generating_pdf_invoices_using_pdfoutput | PDFoutput]] automatically attempts to map database elements to template placeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Automatic Mapping:** The tool identifies database properties (left column) and connects them to template elements (right column) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For example, `client address` from the database maps to `{client address}` in the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Matching Names:** It is important that the placeholder names in the template (inside curly braces) exactly match the column names in the database for accurate automatic mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Manual Correction:** If a mapping is incorrect or incomplete (shown in gray), you can manually click on it and search for the correct database value to establish the link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Export and Generation
1.  **Export:** Click "Export" to begin the PDF generation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
2.  **PDF Status Column:** In the [[using_notion_database_as_an_invoice_source | Notion database]], a "PDF status" column will automatically get ticked as each PDF file is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  **Preview:** After generation, you can click "Preview sample" to review the output, ensuring all data is correctly populated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
4.  **Download:** Click "Download all" to download all generated PDF files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Customization
All elements in the template are customizable to fit specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The key is to ensure that placeholder text elements are consistently placed inside curly braces and that their names match the corresponding column names in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

This article provides an overview of how to utilize a business cash flow template to track cash flow and manage business activities. The template includes sections for an overview, accounts, quarterly summaries, business activity, and detailed transaction entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Cash Flow Overview

The template's cash flow overview provides a comprehensive look at your financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Summary Section
On the left side of the cash flow overview, a summary section displays the opening balance of cash, total cash inflow from all [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]], cash outflow from all [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]], and the closing balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These balances automatically update as you [[entering_and_summarizing_transactions | enter transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Account Section
On the right, the "Account" section allows you to set up and manage different financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

*   **Assets**: You can specify various assets like cash, bank accounts, receivables, and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Existing assets can be edited by clicking a pencil icon, or new assets can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Classifications and Payment Frequency**: For each asset, you can define an opening balanceâ€”the starting balance when you begin using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Assets can be categorized using "classifications," such as classifying a credit card as a debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. You can also specify a "payment frequency," which indicates how often you receive or make payments for a particular item, useful for tracking income and [[managing_different_types_of_business_expenses | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Opening Units and Asset Class**: "Opening units" are relevant for tracking investments or inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. An "asset class" can be assigned, such as "inventory" for inventory items or "investment" for investment items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Liabilities, Income, and Expenses**: The same principles for adding and editing items apply to liabilities, income, and [[managing_different_types_of_business_expenses | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. You can add new items by clicking "new" under any category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Quarterly Overview
The "Quarterly Overview" section provides a detailed view of cash flow movement for each month, divided into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. It shows inflow (cash coming into the business), outflow (cash going out of the business), and net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This section automatically updates as [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]] are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Business Activity
The "Business Activity" section categorizes cash flow into three types: operating, investing, and financing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

*   **Operating Activities**: These include activities related to the core operations of the business, such as salary payments or revenue receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Investing Activities**: This category covers investments made by the business, such as stock or mutual fund investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Financing Activities**: These involve activities related to raising loans or debt to run the business, or their repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## [[Entering and summarizing transactions | Entering and Summarizing Transactions]]

The core of [[utilizing_the_transaction_section_for_expense_management | expense management]] and cash flow tracking in the template is the [[using_a_transactions_tab_for_finance | transactions tab]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Transaction Views
The transaction section offers several views: income, [[managing_different_types_of_business_expenses | expense]], asset, liability, investments, and inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Each view shows previously added [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]], sorted by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Adding an Income Transaction (Detailed Example)
To add a new transaction, use the buttons on the left: "add income," "add expense," "add asset," or "add liability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Clicking "add income" automatically adds an income transaction with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

*   **Date and Period**: The date can be changed using a calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. You can also specify a financial period (e.g., "January 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Description and Account**: Enter a description for the income (e.g., "sales revenue") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Then, select the relevant account from a dropdown list (e.g., "sales revenue account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode and Amount**: Specify how the payment was received (e.g., cash or bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Enter the amount of money received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Cash Flow Type (Operating, Investing, Financing)**: Select the type of business activity this cash flow relates to:
    *   **Operating**: For day-to-day business affairs like sales revenue or salary payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   **Investing**: If funds are put into investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
    *   **Financing**: For taking or repaying loans or debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Transaction Type (Inflow/Outflow)**: This denotes the direction of cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Income [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]] are "inflow" as cash comes into the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, while [[managing_different_types_of_business_expenses | expense]] [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]] are "outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. For assets and liabilities, assess whether cash is coming in or going out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Documents and Tax Rate**: You can attach supporting documents, such as sales receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. A tax rate can be entered to automatically calculate the tax amount on the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Managing Other Transactions (Expenses, Assets, Liabilities, Investments, Inventory)
Similar buttons on the left are used to add expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. For investments and inventory, specific sections allow you to track units, purchase/sale prices, and automatically calculate profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This includes [[tracking_transactions_and_balances_for_investments | tracking transactions and balances for investments]] like stock purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, and managing inventory values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## Updating Financial Data
All calculations and [[summary_and_reporting_of_financial_transactions | summaries]] automatically update as [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | transactions]] are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. If figures do not update immediately, you can manually refresh them by clicking on the balance and selecting "sum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

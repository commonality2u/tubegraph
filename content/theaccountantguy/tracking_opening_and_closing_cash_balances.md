The business cash flow template offers a summary section to help users [[tracking_transactions_and_balances_for_investments | track their cash flow]], including opening and closing balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Overview of Balances
The cash flow overview, located on the left side of the template, displays a summary section that includes:
*   The opening balance of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   The total inflow of cash from all entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   The total cash outflow from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   The final closing balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

When setting up different accounts, such as assets, you can specify an "opening balance" for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This represents the starting balance of the asset when you begin using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## How Balances Update
These opening and closing balances automatically update as transactions are entered into the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This applies to all updates within the template, including the total cash inflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> and the overall summary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

If the figures do not update immediately, you can manually refresh them by clicking on the sum and balance options, which will automatically update the displayed amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

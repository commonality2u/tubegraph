The employee paycheck tracker is a simple template designed to [[using_templates_for_employee_payment_tracking | keep track of all your employee payments]] in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Template Sections

The template is divided into three main sections: Records, Payments, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Records
The records section stores all pertinent details about an employee, including:
*   Their status (e.g., permanent employee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Payments due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Number of months payment is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Payment basis (monthly or hourly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   The amount being paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

This section serves as a [[employee_record_management | complete record of all the employees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Employees can be added by clicking "new," or new categories can be added by clicking a "plus" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. [[managing_employee_details_and_departments | Existing departments]] can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Payments
The payment section displays:
*   Total paycheck due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   Balance paycheck due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   Any advance amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

A [[personal_finance_tracking | personal finance tracker]] spreadsheet can be used to track income and expense details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This type of spreadsheet typically includes three main tabs: the Dashboard, Transactions, and Budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. After inputting budget estimations and transaction details, the Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of your financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Data

Before analyzing, information needs to be populated in the other tabs:
*   **Budget Tab**: Feed in details related to income and expense accounts, specifying the amount for each month in relation to budgeted expenses or income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Accounts should be categorized as income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Transactions Tab**: Add new transactions, including the date, details of the transaction, category (linking to accounts specified in the budget tab), and the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This tab also includes a formula-driven column to specify whether the transaction is an income or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Utilizing the Dashboard

The dashboard section allows for the analysis of your income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. All analysis is controlled by filtering options such as category, period, and type of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Key Analytical Views

*   **Overall Summary**: You can view a summary of all income and expenses for a specified period (e.g., an entire year) and for all accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This summary will display the total income, total expense amount, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Income Overview**: This section specifies the different sources of income earned during the filtered period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Expenses Overview**: Similar to the income overview, this section details your expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Monthly [[personal_finance_tracking | Personal Finance]] Overview**: A detailed view that specifies the income and expense details for each month, along with the net balance for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Status Call-up**: This feature indicates whether expenses have been exceeded or not, based on predefined criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Filtering and Customization

The dashboard allows for flexible filtering to gain specific insights:
*   You can filter to see the total income detail for an entire period and for all accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   The category can be changed to focus on individual sources of income or specific expense categories, such as "salary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Changing the category will update the entire view to show only details relevant to that selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

This dashboard section helps in performing thorough analysis of your income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

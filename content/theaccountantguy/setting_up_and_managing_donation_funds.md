The presented Notion template is a [[charity_donation_tracking_using_notion | charity donation tracker]] designed to organize all your charitable contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It features a "Donation Funds Overview" at the top, which includes three main sections: Fund Setup, Donations Overview, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The "Fund Setup" section is where you [[organizing_donations_by_categories | organize donations by categories]] and individual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Categorizing Donations
Donations are initially divided into three predefined categories: Health, Environment, and Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Editing Categories**: Existing categories can be edited by clicking on them and typing in a new name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: A new category can be added by sliding the bottom slider to the right and clicking the plus icon, which prompts you to create a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Funds
Underneath each category, individual funds are listed, such as American Red Cross, WHO, and Care Funds for Health, or Sierra Club and The Nature Conservancy for Environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Adding a New Fund**: Click the "Add Funds" button to create a new fund. It will initially appear without a classification, requiring you to slide to the right and then move it to an appropriate category using the three dots icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Editing Fund Details**: Once a fund is placed, click the pencil icon to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   **Name**: Input the name of the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   **Opening Balance**: Enter the amount of donations made to this fund at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. For example, $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   **Targeted Donation**: Set the desired total donation amount for this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. For example, $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   **Start Date**: Define when you began donating to this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For example, January 1, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   **Target Date**: Set the deadline by which you aim to reach the targeted donation amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, December 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Deleting a Fund**: Click the three dots next to a fund and select "Delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Recent Donations

The "Recent Donations" section [[adding_and_managing_expenses | tracks individual donations]] in a month-wise split, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Donation Details**: Each entry includes:
    *   **Date**: The date of the donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

    *   **Period**: The month and year of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. New periods can be created by typing the date and clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   **Fund**: Select the specific fund from those set up in the "Fund Setup" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   **Recommend**: This figure suggests how much you need to contribute monthly from the start date to reach the targeted amount by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. For example, Sierra Club might require $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: Input the actual donation amount made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

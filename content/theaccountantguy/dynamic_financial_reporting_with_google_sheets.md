## How to Use the Reporting Section

To utilize the dynamic reporting:
1.  **Select a Category**: Use the drop-down menu in the reporting section to choose the desired financial category, such as "expense," "income," "sinking fund," or "debt details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
2.  **Select a Month**: Double-click on the date field to open a calendar and select any date within the specific month you wish to analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
3.  **View Updates**: The report will automatically reflect the data for the selected month and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. For example, selecting January for income would show the total income for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### Examples of Dynamic Updates:

*   Changing the month for income will automatically update the income report and its accompanying pie chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   Switching from "income" to "expense" in the drop-down will display the expense analysis for the chosen month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   Selecting "sinking fund" for January will show all January details, and changing it to February will update for February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

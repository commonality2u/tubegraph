This guide outlines how to utilize an [[using_employee_schedule_templates | employee schedule template]] to [[tracking_employee_tasks_and_shifts | keep track of employee schedules]] and monitor their performance and hours worked within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template offers four main views to facilitate this tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Overview of Views

The template provides distinct sections for comprehensive employee oversight:
*   **Employee Details:** Lists all employee information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Task Schedule:** Helps input all [[tracking_employee_tasks_and_shifts | tasks for employees]] based on different dates and [[tracking_employee_tasks_and_shifts | shifts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Monthly View:** Displays months divided into quarters, showing hours worked and leave taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Employee Performance:** Shows exact information broken down by individual employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Employee Details

The "Employee Details" section is where new employees are added and their information managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   New employees can be added by clicking "new" and filling in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Categories such as operations, marketing, and finance can be set up, and new categories can be added or existing ones edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   When adding an employee, details like name, employee ID, contact information, department, position, and email ID can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This section forms the foundation for [[employee_record_management | managing employee details and departments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Task Schedule

Once employee details are entered, the "Task Schedule" section is used for [[tracking_employee_tasks_and_shifts | entering task-related information for employees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This view helps monitor daily performance and hours:
*   Tasks are divided into different [[tracking_employee_tasks_and_shifts | shifts]] (e.g., first, second, third shift) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Users can enter a start time and an end time for tasks, indicating the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   Task details can be added, and employees can be linked to specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   The system automatically computes the hours an employee has worked on a specific task based on the entered time information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Employees can mark their attendance as "present," "on leave," or "day off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This assists in [[tracking_and_updating_attendance_and_training_dates | tracking attendance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   The status of a task can be updated to "in progress," "completed," "not started," or "not applicable" (e.g., if on leave or day off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Monthly Performance View

After entering task schedules, the "Monthly View" provides an aggregated perspective on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>:
*   Months are divided into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   It displays the total hours an employee worked for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   It also shows the total hours an employee has been on leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   A "total hours" metric is provided, which is the summation of working hours and leave hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   This view offers a quick overview of overall monthly performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Individual Employee Performance

For a more granular look, the "Employee Performance" section allows monitoring individual employee contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>:
*   This view displays the same information as the monthly view but specifically for each employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Users can see the hours an employee worked, the hours they were on leave, and their total hours in totality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

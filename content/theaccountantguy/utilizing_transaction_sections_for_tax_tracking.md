This article explains how to use a Notion template designed by Sanat Biswal, "The Accountant Guy," to [[notion_tax_payments_tracking_template | track all your tax payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The template provides a summary section for quarterly tax payments, allowing users to view tax liabilities at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

The top section of the template displays a tax payment summary, which includes three main components: Accounts, Financials, and Quarterly Taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Accounts
The "Accounts" section is where you set up all your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources:** These are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources:** These allow for input tax credit to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The template initially includes "Services" and "Goods" as revenue sources and "Purchases" as an expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. You can add new revenue or expense sources using quick action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The number of revenue and expense sources automatically updates as new ones are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Financials
The "Financials" section allows you to [[tracking_and_managing_transactions_for_cash_flow | track your revenue and expense amounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It also tracks the corresponding tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For example, $2,000 in services revenue might have a tax payable of $200 (based on a 10% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Similarly, purchases can generate input taxes, such as $10 in input taxes for purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. All details entered in the transaction section at the bottom of the template update the top summary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes
The "Quarterly Taxes" section reflects all tax payments due for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. For each quarter, it displays the taxes payable, input tax, and the final tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. If transactions are booked for a specific quarter, like Quarter 3, the figures for that quarter will be updated accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This provides a summary view of your [[tracking_quarterly_tax_payments_using_notion | quarterly tax obligations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Transaction Section
After setting up your revenue and expense account sources, you can utilize the transaction section to [[adding_transactions_to_track_income_and_expenses | add individual income and expense entries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Transactions are classified into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This allows for detailed [[using_transaction_entries_in_notion_for_expense_tracking | tracking and management of financial activities]] for tax purposes.

### Adding Revenue Transactions
To [[utilizing_the_transaction_section_for_expense_entry | enter a revenue transaction]]:
1.  Click the "Add Revenue" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This automatically adds a new line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
2.  Select the **period** (e.g., Quarter 3 for September) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Choose the relevant **account** (e.g., Goods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
4.  Enter the **amount** (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
5.  Specify the **tax rate** (e.g., 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   The template automatically calculates the tax payable based on the entered rate (e.g., $80 for $1,000 at 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
Once entered, these details instantly update the quarterly taxes and other summary sections at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions
Similar to revenue entries, to add an expense transaction:
1.  Click the "Add Expense" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This adds a new expense line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  Fill in details such as the **period** (e.g., Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
3.  Select the relevant **account** (e.g., Purchases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
4.  Enter the **amount** (e.g., $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Input the **tax rate** (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   The template calculates the input credit (e.g., $50 for $500 at 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
Expense entries also update the overall tax liability and input credit figures in the summary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Profit and Loss Section
The template also includes a [[profit_and_loss_section_in_notion_for_tax_purposes | profit and loss section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This section displays:
*   Total revenue earned from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   Total expenses booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   The total profit made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

This comprehensive approach allows users to effectively [[tracking_construction_business_expenses | track expenses]] and manage tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

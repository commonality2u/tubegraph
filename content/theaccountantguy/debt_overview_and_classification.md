The [[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | debt overview]] section of a debt payment tracker categorizes [[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | debt]] based on different payment frequencies, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This section provides a comprehensive breakdown of each [[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | debt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

*   **[[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | Loan]] Amount** The total amount of the [[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | loan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Customizing and Managing Categories

Users can add new [[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | debt]] categories or installment periods, such as "weekly," to tailor the tracker to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The system typically includes common payment schedules like annual, monthly, quarterly, and weekly repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

[[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | Debts]] can be moved between different repayment schedules (e.g., from monthly to quarterly), and all associated repayment schedules and details automatically update accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Debt Entries

New [[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | debt]] entries can be added to the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Initially, new entries may appear under a "no payment frequency" column, from which they can then be assigned to a specific payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Existing [[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | loan]] details can be edited directly, with changes automatically updating across all relevant sections of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Wizzygen is a platform designed to create AI-generated content directly within your [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Notion]] workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To begin using Wizzygen, initial settings must be configured, primarily involving the "Connections database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Accessing Wizzygen Settings
You can navigate to the settings tab by clicking the gear icon on the home screen or selecting "settings" from the sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Defining the Connections Database
The "Connections database" is the initial setting that needs to be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This database is where Wizzygen stores all the different connections you establish between the platform and your [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Notion]] workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Steps to Define the Connections Database
1.  **Open Template**: Click on the icon to the right of the "Connection database" setting. This action will open a new Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  **Duplicate Template**: On the opened template page, click "Duplicate" to copy it to your local [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Notion]] workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   A pop-up will appear, allowing you to select the specific [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Notion]] workspace where you want to duplicate the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   Click "Add to private" to complete the duplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This will automatically add the "Connections database" to your [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
3.  **Copy URL**: Once the database is duplicated, copy its URL from the top of the Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
4.  **Paste URL in Wizzygen**: Return to Wizzygen's settings tab and paste the copied URL into the "Connections database" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Connecting the Database to Wizzygen Integration
After duplicating the "Connections database" into your [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Notion]] workspace, you must connect it to the Wizzygen integration:
1.  **Access Connections**: In your duplicated [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Notion]] database, click the three dots in the top right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
2.  **Select Integration**: Scroll down and select the "Connections" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Type "Wizzygen" (or the name of your integration) and select the internal connection you have created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
3.  **Confirm**: Click "Confirm" to establish the connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This links your [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Notion]] template to Wizzygen via the internal integration secret key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This connection needs to be done only once for the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Saving Settings
Once all necessary settings are defined, including the Connections database and other configurations like the AI engine and [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Notion]] internal integration secret, click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. All settings are saved in your local storage, ensuring privacy and security as they are not stored on an external cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. You can clear these settings from local storage at any time using the "clear" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Managing Connections
The "Connections database" in [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Notion]] lists all created connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. You can manage these connections by sorting, filtering, or deleting them as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   From the "Connections" tab in Wizzygen, you can select any particular connection to resume your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   To delete a connection from Wizzygen, go to the "Connections" tab, click the three dots next to the connection, and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

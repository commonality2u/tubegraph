Setting a net worth goal is a fundamental step when [[tracking_net_worth_in_notion | tracking net worth in Notion]] using a dedicated tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This goal serves as a target for your financial journey and helps in assessing your progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## How to Set Your Net Worth Goal

Within the net worth tracker, you can specify your desired net worth goal in the "Get Started" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

1.  Navigate to the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  Locate the "Net Worth Goal" entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
3.  Click on the displayed amount (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
4.  Edit the value to your desired net worth target, for example, $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

As soon as you enter this value, the entire database automatically updates to reflect this new goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Understanding Your Progress Towards the Goal

The net worth section provides a comprehensive overview of your financial status relative to your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Key figures include:

*   **Net Worth Goal**: The target you have set (e.g., $14,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: Your current net worth, calculated as assets minus liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The gap between your net worth goal and your total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows how much of your net worth goal you have accomplished so far (e.g., 45% if your total net worth is $5,350 and your goal is $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Updating Your Net Worth Goal

Your net worth goal is not static and can be adjusted as your financial situation or aspirations change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

1.  Access the net worth view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
2.  Click on the existing net worth goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
3.  Change the value to your new desired goal (e.g., from $14,000 to $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Changing this value will automatically update all related calculations in the net worth overview, allowing you to continually assess your [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals | savings targets and goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This feature is crucial for [[calculating_and_tracking_savings_goals | calculating and tracking savings goals]] and maintaining an accurate [[monthly_net_worth_overview | monthly net worth overview]].

The [[creating_an_expense_tracker_with_notion | Notion Expense Tracker]] allows users to manage all their expenses in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A key component of this tracker is the ability to define and manage expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## [[categorizing_expenses_in_notion | Expense Categories]] Overview

The tracker features a dedicated category section at the top, which initially displays three different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Each category can be customized to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For every category, there is both a "budgeted expense amount" and an "actual expense amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. These amounts are automatically updated as expenses are entered into the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## [[modifying_and_updating_expense_categories_in_notion | Renaming Categories]]

To rename a category:
1.  Hover over the desired category, and a pencil icon will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
2.  Click on the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
3.  Rename the category as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
4.  Hit enter to save the new category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## [[modifying_and_updating_expense_categories_in_notion | Deleting Categories]]

2.  Select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_notion | Managing Category Budgets]]

Users can set their own budgeted expense amounts for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. By clicking on the "budgeted expense amount" for a category, you can adjust the figure to your requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The total budgeted amount in the summary section of the tracker will reflect these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

This [[using_notion_for_expense_management | Notion]] template is highly customizable and can be used for various needs, whether for personal or business expense tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

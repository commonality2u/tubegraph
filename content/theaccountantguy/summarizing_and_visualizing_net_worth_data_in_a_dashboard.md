The [[creating_and_using_a_notion_net_worth_tracker | Notion Net Worth Tracker]] incorporates a primary dashboard designed for summarizing and visualizing financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This dashboard pulls information from various databases to present a comprehensive financial overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

The dashboard includes several key sections for [[analyzing_financial_data_using_the_dashboard_section | analyzing financial data]]:

### Summary Section
This section provides an [[overview_of_net_worth_goal_and_progress_tracking | overview of net worth goal and progress tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It is linked to the net worth goal database and displayed in a gallery layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The calculated components include:
*   **Net Worth Goal Amount** The target amount to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth at Present** The current net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Amount Required to Reach Goal** The difference between the goal and current net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Total Growth Achieved** The growth in net worth since January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Net Worth Achieved** The proportion of current net worth to the targeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Monthly Net Worth Overview
This section provides a [[monthly_net_worth_breakdown_including_assets_and_liabilities | monthly net worth breakdown including assets and liabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It is linked to the net worth database and also set out in a gallery layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. It specifies:
*   Total assets for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Total liabilities for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Net worth for the month (assets less liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Assets Breakdown
This dashboard component provides a breakdown of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It is linked to the assets breakdown database and displayed in a gallery layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It details:
*   Individual assets, classified into five categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

*   The proportion of each asset to the total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Liabilities Breakdown
Similar to the assets breakdown, this component provides a detailed view of liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. It is linked to the liabilities breakdown database and presented in a gallery layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. It specifies:
*   Four types of liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

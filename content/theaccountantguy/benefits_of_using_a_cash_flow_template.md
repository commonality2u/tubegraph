A business cash flow template is designed to help users track and manage their cash flow efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool provides a comprehensive overview of a business's financial movements, allowing for better decision-making and financial planning.

## Cash Flow Overview

The template includes a dedicated "Cash Flow Overview" section that summarizes key financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This summary displays:
*   **Opening Balance**: The starting cash balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Total Inflow**: The total cash received from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Cash Outflow**: The total cash spent through all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Closing Balance**: The final cash balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

These balances automatically update as transactions are entered, providing real-time insights into the business's cash position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Account Management

The "Account Section" of the template allows users to [[how_to_set_up_accounts_using_a_cash_flow_template | set up and manage different accounts]] under various categories such as assets, liabilities, income, and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Customization Options
Users can [[customizing_budget_templates | customize]] account details to fit their specific needs:
*   **Adding/Editing Accounts**: Existing accounts can be edited, or new accounts can be added by clicking a pencil icon or "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This allows for specific naming, such as "new asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**: Users can specify the starting balance for each asset when beginning to use the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

New classifications can be added or existing ones edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **[[classification_and_payment_frequency_in_cash_flow_management | Payment Frequency]]**: For income and expenses, the frequency of payment or receipt can be specified (e.g., quarterly for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Opening Units and Asset Class**: These fields are relevant for inventory and investments, allowing users to track units and categorize assets (e.g., inventory asset class, investment asset class) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Overview of Cash Flow Movements

The template provides two detailed overviews for tracking cash flow movements:

### Quarterly Overview
The "Quarterly Overview" section offers an [[overview_of_cash_flow_movements_in_quarterly_and_business_activities | overview of cash flow movement]] for each month, divided into different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Inflow**: Cash coming into the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Outflow**: Cash going out of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Net Balance**: The difference between inflow and outflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

This section automatically updates as transactions are entered, providing a quick summary of monthly cash flow within each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Business Activity
The "Business Activity" section categorizes cash flow into three main types of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>:
*   **Operating Activities**: Related to the core operations of the business, such as salary payments or revenue receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Investing Activities**: Pertaining to investments made by the business, such as stock or mutual fund investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Financing Activities**: Involving raising loans or debt to run the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Each category displays its respective inflow, outflow, and net balance, offering a clear picture of cash flow by business function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Transaction Entry and Management

The template allows users to [[tracking_and_managing_transactions_for_cash_flow | track and manage transactions]] through different views, including income, expense, asset, liability, investments, and inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Adding Transactions
Users can add new transactions by clicking "add income," "add expense," "add asset," or "add liability" buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The template automatically pre-fills the current date, which can be changed using a calendar tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Transaction Details
For each transaction, various details can be entered:
*   **Period**: Specify the relevant month or period (e.g., January 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief description of the transaction (e.g., "sales revenue") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Account**: Select the relevant account from the list set up in the account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode**: Indicate how the payment was received or made (e.g., cash or bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Type of Cash Flow**: Categorize the transaction as operating, investing, or financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Transaction Type**: Specify whether it's an "inflow" (cash coming in) or "outflow" (cash going out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Income transactions are typically inflow, while expenses are outflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Documents**: Attach relevant documents like sales receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate**: Incorporate a tax rate to automatically calculate tax amounts on transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

All entered transactions automatically update the total cash inflow, outflow, and net balance figures in the overview sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. If figures do not update immediately, clicking on sum or balance options can refresh them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Investments and Inventory
The template also supports tracking investments and inventory, allowing users to record units, prices, and calculate profit or loss on sales and purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

By centralizing all cash flow information and providing customizable tracking, the template helps businesses maintain accurate financial records and understand their financial position at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

Subscription payment reminders received via WhatsApp are fully customizable to meet individual requirements, meaning there is no fixed template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Instructions and guides for setting up this automation are available upon downloading the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Setting Up a Custom Subscription Reminder

To [[setting_up_whatsapp_subscription_payment_reminders | set up subscription payment reminders]] that are customized to your needs, follow these steps:

1.  **Access the Database**: Reminders are set up through a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  **[[creating_templates_for_recurring_payment_reminders | Create a New Template]]**: Click on the dropdown menu and select the option to create a new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
3.  **Specify Subscription Details**:
    *   Enter the name of the subscription (e.g., "Spotify") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
    *   Specify the subscription amount (e.g., $150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
4.  **Set Repetition**:
    *   Click on the three dots next to the newly added entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   Select "repeat" and choose the desired mode of repetition, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This ensures the reminder for the specified subscription and amount is repeated monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
5.  **Define Start Time and Date**:
    *   A new window will appear where you can specify the exact time and date for the reminder to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   For example, you can set it to repeat every month on the 23rd at 11:56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
6.  **Save the Reminder**: Click "Save" to finalize the setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. An arrow icon will indicate that the reminder is set to repeat automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Receiving Alerts

Once set, the system will automatically add a new line item in the database at the specified time and date each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Subsequently, a notification alert for the payment reminder will be received directly on your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. These alerts include a "pay now" link to facilitate direct payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This enables timely payment of subscription amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

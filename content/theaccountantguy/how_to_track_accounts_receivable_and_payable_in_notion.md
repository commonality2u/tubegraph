The Accounts Receivable and Payable Tracker in Notion is designed to help users track all customer and vendor balances efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This system allows for comprehensive [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | income and expense tracking]] by managing money owed to your business (receivables) and money your business owes to others (payables) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Accounts Section

The "Receivable and Payable Account" section at the top of the tracker has four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The primary view is the "Accounts" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Setting Up Accounts
In the "Accounts" view, you can set up details for both your customers and vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This includes their opening balances and the number of invoices due against those balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

*   **Adding Customers/Vendors**: Quick action buttons on the left allow for quickly adding new vendors or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Once added, a pencil icon allows for editing their details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Feeding in Balances**: After adding details, you can input the opening balance (the starting receivable or payable balance) and the number of pending invoices against that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Receivable Section

This section reflects all receivable accounts and their respective details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For each customer, the outstanding amount is prominently displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Tracking Transactions
It shows all transactions carried out, such as invoices raised against specific customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

*   **Invoice Status**: The status of each invoice can be changed (e.g., from 'due' to 'paid') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Marking Payments**: By checking a box, you can indicate if an invoice has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. If marked as paid, the amount will not be calculated in the total outstanding balance displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Unchecking the box will recalculate the outstanding balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Payable Section

Similar to the receivable section, the payable section displays details for each vendor transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

*   **Transaction Details**: This includes the invoice date, invoice number, status, and the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Marking Payments**: Users can mark invoices as paid or unpaid, which automatically updates the outstanding balances displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Summary Section

The summary section provides an overall financial snapshot of all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

*   **Key Metrics**: It reflects the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. These figures are calculated from all transactions entered in the sections below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section is divided into three main segments: Receivable, Payable, and Quarterly Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Receivable Segment
Here, individual receivable entries are detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

*   **Entry Details**: Includes date, period (broken down into quarters), description, account name (customer), amount, invoice number, and invoice status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Automatic Updates**: Once these details are entered, they automatically update throughout the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Paid Status**: A "paid" checkbox indicates if an amount has been settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. If checked, the amount will not be included in the total balances for the concerned person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Quick Actions**: A quick action button allows for adding a new receivable entry, which automatically picks the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Organization**: Entries are categorized by month, with the latest months appearing at the top, along with a count of transactions for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Payable Segment
Similar to the receivable segment, this displays detailed payable entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

*   **Quick Actions**: A quick action button for adding a new payable entry is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary
This section provides an overview of all transactions, broken down by quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

*   **Quarterly Breakdown**: For each quarter, it shows the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Total Amount**: The cumulative total amount is also reflected at the top of this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

The paycheck budget tracker includes features like [[quick_actions_for_investment_management | quick action buttons]] and [[setting_up_revenue_and_expense_sources | expense sources]] to streamline budget management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. These tools help users manage their budgeted payments and finances efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Quick Action Buttons

The tracker offers [[quick_actions_for_investment_management | quick action buttons]] for convenient data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Add Transaction Button
Clicking the [[tracking_and_entering_transactions_in_a_business_expense_tracker | "Add Transaction"]] button automatically creates a new transaction entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Users can then input the specific details for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Expense Sources

The tracker also provides an [[setting_up_revenue_and_expense_sources | expense source]] feature to categorize spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Add Expense Source Button
The "Add Expense Source" button automatically adds a new expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Initially, it might be added under a default head, such as "fixed expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Users can adjust the category of these expenses to fit their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Moving Expense Sources
After an [[setting_up_revenue_and_expense_sources | expense source]] is added, it can be relocated to any of the defined expense heads (e.g., fixed expense, variable expense, or savings and investments) by clicking the three dots next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

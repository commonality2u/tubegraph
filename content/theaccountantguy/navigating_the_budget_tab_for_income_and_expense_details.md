The Budget Tab is one of the three primary sections within the personal finance tracker spreadsheet, alongside the Dashboard and Transactions tabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This tab is essential for [[tracking_income_and_expenses | tracking income and expenses]] by allowing users to feed in initial details about their financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It's also crucial for [[setting_and_managing_budgets_for_expenses | setting and managing budgets for expenses]] and income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Feeding in Account Details

Before you can effectively track your finances, you need to populate the Budget Tab with relevant information:

*   **Account Setup**: Begin by inputting details related to your various income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Categorization**: Categorize each account as either an 'income' or an 'expense' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Monthly Budgeting**: Specify the budgeted amount for each account for each month throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These amounts represent either your budgeted expenses or your income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Goal Amount Column

The "Goal Amount" column automatically totals the monthly amounts you enter for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. As you input or adjust figures for any given month, the sum in the "Goal Amount" column will update instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

> ℹ️ **Formula-Driven Column**
> The "Goal Amount" column is formula-driven. If you [[adding_and_managing_expenses | add new]] line items, you must drag the formula down from an existing cell to ensure it copies over and correctly calculates the sum for new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Adding New Rows

If you need more rows to add additional accounts, you can easily do so:

1.  Navigate to the end of the tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  Select the desired number of rows you wish to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
3.  Click "Add" to insert new rows at the bottom of the sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Once you have set up all your accounts and their respective budget estimations in the Budget Tab, you can proceed to the [[using_the_transactions_tab_for_income_and_expenses | Transactions Tab]] to begin logging individual financial activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This comprehensive setup ensures effective [[tracking_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | tracking budgeted and actual expenses]].

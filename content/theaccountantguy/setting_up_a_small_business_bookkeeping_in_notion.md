1.  **Start Here Section**: Located at the top, for initial setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  **Summary Section**: Provides an overview of all entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
3.  **Transactions Window**: Where all business transaction details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

#### Editing, Deleting, and Adding Accounts

The Accounts Receivable and Payable Tracker in Notion helps users track all customer and vendor balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This system is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of financial transactions with customers and vendors.

## Accounts View

The "Accounts View" is the initial section within the receivable and payable accounts setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Here, users can:
*   Set up customer and vendor details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Input their opening balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   Specify the number of invoices due against those opening balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Quickly add a new vendor or customer using dedicated action buttons on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Once added, details can be edited by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Feed in the "opening balance," which is the starting balance of the receivable or payable, and the "invoices pending" against this amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Receivable Section

This section displays all receivable accounts along with their respective details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It shows customer details and all associated transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, including:
*   Transaction dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Invoice amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Invoice status, which can be changed among three available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   A checkbox to mark if an invoice has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. When an invoice is marked as paid, its amount is not included in the calculated outstanding balance at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
For each customer, a total outstanding balance is reflected at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Payable Section

Similar to the receivable section, the payable section provides details for each vendor transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It shows:
*   Date of invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Invoice number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Status of the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   Amount raised against the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   A "paid" checkbox that, when checked, removes the amount from the outstanding balance calculation at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Summary Section

The summary section provides an overall financial snapshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It reflects:
*   Total receivable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Total payable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
These figures are calculated from all transactions entered into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section is divided into three segments: Receivable, Payable, and Quarterly Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Receivable Segment
Users can enter detailed transaction information here:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   Period (selectable in quarters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Account name (customer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Invoice number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Status of the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
All fed-in details automatically update across the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. A "paid" column indicates if the amount has been paid; if checked, it won't reflect in the total balances for the concerned person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Quick action buttons "receivable entry" and "payable entry" allow for rapid data input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Entries are categorized by month, with later months appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Payable Segment
This segment functions similarly to the receivable segment for [[entering_transactions_and_managing_accounts_in_notion | payable transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary
The "Quarterly Summary" provides a consolidated view of all quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For each quarter, it displays:
*   Total receivable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Total payable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   Net balance (receivable less payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
The total amounts for all quarters are also reflected at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This provides a quarterly overview of the financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

This comprehensive tracker allows users to efficiently manage customer and vendor balances, providing quick overviews and detailed transaction insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

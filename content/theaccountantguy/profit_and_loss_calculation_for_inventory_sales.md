The profit and loss calculation feature within an inventory management template helps users determine the profitability of their sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This section is specifically designed for tracking the financial outcome of selling [[tracking_inventory_for_small_businesses | inventory]] items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Key Components
To calculate profit or loss for an [[tracking_inventory_for_small_businesses | inventory]] sale, two primary values are required:
*   **Sale Price** The price at which the item was sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Purchase Price / Cost of Manufacturing** The cost associated with acquiring or producing the item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Calculation
The system automatically calculates the profit or loss once the sale price and the corresponding purchase price or manufacturing cost are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

For finished goods, users can either:
*   Input the total cost of manufacturing, which includes the cost of various raw materials used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   Input the direct purchase price if the finished product was bought and then resold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

#### Example
Consider a sale of "bread":
*   **Sale Price:** $40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>
*   **Cost of Manufacturing:** $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   **Units Sold:** 30 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

The profit per unit is calculated as Sale Price - Cost of Manufacturing: $40 - $10 = $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
The total profit for 30 units would be $30 (profit per unit) Ã— 30 units = $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

This [[profit_and_loss_section_in_notion_for_tax_purposes | profit and loss section]] helps small businesses quickly understand the profitability of their [[managing_inventory_transactions | inventory transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

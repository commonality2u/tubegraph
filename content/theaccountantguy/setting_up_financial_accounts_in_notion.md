This article discusses how to [[using_notion_for_personal_finance_management | track personal finances]] using a Notion setup, focusing on the initial configuration of financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The system is divided into sections for net worth targets, accounts (income, expenses, assets, liabilities), and a summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Getting Started: The Account Section

The "Account" section is the primary place to set up and manage all financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This section allows you to specify different accounts for:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>

For each account, you can include opening balances, payment frequency, and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Setting up Income and Expenses

To [[setting_up_income_and_expenses_in_notion | start tracking income and expenses]], navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Adding/Modifying Accounts**: You can modify existing income (e.g., salary, side hustle) or expense (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Netflix) accounts by clicking the "edit" button, or add new ones by clicking "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Expenses can be classified based on your requirements, such as "bills" (e.g., groceries, utility bills) or "subscriptions" (e.g., Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Other classifications include "savings" and "debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: You can set how frequently an expense is expected to be paid (e.g., monthly for utility bills, annually for subscriptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**: Income and expense accounts typically do not have an opening balance, so this field can be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Setting up Liabilities (Debt)

To [[setting_financial_goals_in_notion | track debt payments]], go to the "Account" section and navigate to the "Liabilities" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

    *   Specify the name of the debt and an opening balance if applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   Classify the account as "debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
    *   Set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Debt**: Click the pencil icon next to an existing debt to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Setting up Assets (Savings)

To [[emergency_funds_setup_using_notion | set up specific funds for savings]], navigate to the "Account" section and then the "Asset" part, as savings are considered assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
*   **Creating a Savings Fund**: Create a new account (e.g., "Education Fund," "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
    *   Classify the account under the "savings" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
    *   You can set a goal amount for the savings fund by editing the account and specifying the "goal amount" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. This will reflect the total amount saved and the percentage achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

### Setting up Bills

To [[creating_and_managing_budgets_in_notion | manage bills]], go to the "Account" section and then to "Expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   Add new expenses (e.g., "Wi-Fi bills") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   Classify them under the "bills" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
*   Set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

*   Set the payment frequency (e.g., annual, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

### Setting up Investments (Stocks, Cryptocurrencies)

To [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | track investments]] in stocks, cryptocurrencies, or other areas, add them under the "Account" section as assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.
*   **Adding Investment Accounts**:
    *   Specify an opening balance (e.g., 0 at the start of the financial year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.
    *   Classify the investment (e.g., "stocks," "crypto"). You can create custom classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.
    *   Specify "opening units" if you hold units at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
    *   Crucially, select "Investments" as the "asset class" from the dropdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>. This helps calculate the total value of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

### Couples' Finance Setup

For couples, the Notion dashboard is equally applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:50]</a>. In the "Account" section, different categories can be split by individual. For example, "salary by him" and "side hustle by her" can denote income from different individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. This allows for [[using_notion_for_personal_finance_management | tracking personal finances]] for two individuals within the same system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

A business expense tracker is a tool designed to help keep track of all business expenses in one general ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This specific tracker offers features for managing expense categories, reviewing an expenses overview, and entering individual transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Expense Categories

The tracker allows users to define various expense categories that their business incurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
Users can:
*   Modify or change predefined expense categories by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Edit subcategories within a main category using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   Add new categories of their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   Set a budgeted amount for each expense category, which will be automatically reflected in the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

For example, setting a budget of $5,000 for "advertising" will cause other sections, like the expenses overview, to update accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Expenses Overview

The "expenses overview" section provides a summary of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It displays:
*   The total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   The budgeted expenses that were set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   A percentage indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is still within limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

This overview dynamically updates based on changes made to budgeted amounts in the expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Tracking and Entering Transactions

The "transaction side" is where users can start [[adding_and_managing_expenses | entering the expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The process for [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | tracking transactions and cash flow in business]] involves:
1.  **Choosing a Date**: Select the date of the expense, which will automatically populate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
2.  **Adding a Description**: Provide a description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
3.  **Selecting an Account**: Choose from predefined accounts or add new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
4.  **Entering the Amount**: Input the monetary value of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Summary

On the left side of the tracker, a summary provides a quick overview of financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This includes:
*   The budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   The total expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   The difference between actual and budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense that has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

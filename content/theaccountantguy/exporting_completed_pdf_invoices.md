[[Using PDF Output software for invoice creation | PDF Output]] is a tool designed to [[Generating PDF invoices using PDF output service | generate professional invoices]] directly from a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This process facilitates the [[exporting and managing invoice documents | exporting and managing invoice documents]] and [[exporting and managing PDF documents for business | PDF documents for business]] in bulk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Invoice Template Structure
A standard invoice template in Notion includes sections like "from" and "to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Key information such as client name, company, address, city, state, and zip are represented as placeholder text enclosed in curly braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Any element within curly braces in the template will be replaced with data from a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Notion Database Integration
For the database aspect, [[Using PDF Output software for invoice creation | PDF Output]] utilizes Notion database elements like client name, amount, bank name, client address, and client company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. For each row of information in the database, the corresponding data populates the template, generating a PDF document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Connecting to PDF Output
To use [[Using PDF Output software for invoice creation | PDF Output]]:
1.  Log in to the [[Using PDF Output software for invoice creation | PDF Output]] interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "help" section (marked "H") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
3.  Complete the necessary steps to enable API keys as instructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
4.  Define a connection name, for example, "invoice generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
5.  Select the specific Notion database (e.g., "professional invoice database") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
6.  Select the corresponding Notion template (e.g., "professional invoice template") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
7.  Click "next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Automatic Data Mapping
Once connected, [[Using PDF Output software for invoice creation | PDF Output]] loads all elements and values from both the database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. It automatically maps each database property (listed on the left) to its corresponding template element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For example, "client address" from the database maps to the "client address" placeholder in the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

It is crucial that the placeholder element names in the template match the column names in the database for automatic mapping to work correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. If a mismatch occurs, the element will appear in gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Users can manually click on the gray element and search for the correct matching value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Exporting and Downloading PDFs
After mapping is complete:
1.  Click "export" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
2.  Observe the "PDF status" column in the Notion database. This column, initially unticked, will automatically become ticked as PDF files are generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  Once the PDFs are generated, click "preview sample" to view an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The output shows a clean, populated invoice with all data from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
4.  To [[Bulk exporting and downloading generated PDF files | download all]] generated files, click "download all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This enables [[exporting bulk PDF documents from a database | bulk exporting PDF documents from a database]] and [[Bulk export of PDF documents | bulk export of PDF documents]] for various use cases, including [[setting up and exporting PDF receipts in bulk | setting up and exporting PDF receipts in bulk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Customization
All elements in the template are customizable according to specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The main principle is to ensure that all placeholder text elements are enclosed in curly braces and that their names precisely match the corresponding column names in the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

By following these instructions, users can connect their Notion database and template to [[Exporting Bulk PDFs with PDF Output Tool | PDF Output]] to efficiently [[Generating PDF invoices using PDF output service | generate and export PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

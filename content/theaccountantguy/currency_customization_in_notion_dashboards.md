Notion dashboards, such as the Employee Training Expenses Tracker, allow for complete customization of currency displays to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. All currencies within the dashboard are editable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Customizing Currency in Database Properties

To change the currency format for specific properties within a Notion database:
1.  Navigate to the relevant view, for example, by changing to a table view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
2.  Click on the property header (e.g., an expense column) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
3.  Select "Edit property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
4.  Within the property settings, locate the "Number format" option, which might initially show "US Dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
5.  Click on this option to change it to any currency of your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

This process enables [[customizing_currency_and_formats_in_notion | customizing currency and formats in Notion]] for individual data points within the database.

## Customizing Currency in Dashboard Overview (Formulas)

For currency displays in the main dashboard overview, such as total expenses or average expenses, the currency symbol is typically embedded directly within the formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
1.  Click on any of the informational elements at the top of the dashboard that display currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
2.  Within the formula editor, you can change the currency symbol (e.g., the dollar sign) to suit your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

This method allows for [[customizing_dashboard_currency | customizing dashboard currency]] in the aggregated financial metrics presented in the dashboard's summary sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Overview of Views

The planner offers four main views for managing finances:
*   Expenses Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   Monthly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Yearly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Summary of all booked expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

### Expenses Overview
This view presents categories like shopping, entertainment, food expenses, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For each expense category, it displays:
*   Total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Percentage of total budgeted amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   A status indicating if the budget was exceeded or if it's under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

### Monthly Overview
This section categorizes expenses by month, allowing for a quick glance at all expenses for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Yearly Overview
Similar to the monthly overview, this view presents the same information but in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Summary Section
This section provides a complete expense overlook in a year format, grouping all expenses to show overall performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Using the Expense Details Database

All information is entered into the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This database helps calculate daily incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. All expenses are categorized into months, sorted in descending format (later months appear on top) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Entering Transactions
To enter a transaction:
1.  Click on "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the date (e.g., February 1, 2024), which automatically modifies the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  Type in the expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Select the "Period" (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Custom periods can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the "Year" (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  Select the "Category" (e.g., "utilities"). Four initial categories are provided, but users can add their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
7.  Input the "Expense Code", which segregates expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Enter the "Expense Amount" in the designated column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The "Expense Amount" column is used for booking specific expenses, while the "Budget Amount" column is used at the start of the month to set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Setting a Budget
To set a budget for a specific expense category at the start of the month:
1.  Select the date (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  Enter the expense name for which the budget is being set (e.g., "Food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the "Period" (e.g., February) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Select the "Year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
5.  Select the "Category" (e.g., "Food"). The expense name and category name should be the same for budget setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
6.  Set the "Expense Code" as the category followed by the month and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
7.  Enter the budget amount in the "Budget Amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once entered, all figures at the top for the respective months and categories will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. As more expense information is added, the overview will automatically update, providing insights into monthly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Analyzing Finances

After booking expenses, various views can be used to extract financial information:
*   **Period View**: Clicking on a period (e.g., Feb 2024) reveals all booked transactions, including the amount and whether it was a budget or an expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Year View**: Clicking on the year shows the budgeted amount, expenses amount, expense as a percentage, and the budget status for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It also displays all transactions for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Category View**: This view indicates how much expense has been booked for a particular category, displaying the expense amount, budgeted amount, expense as a percentage, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It also lists all category-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View**: The expense code allows users to see how much has been booked for a specific category and month compared to the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

These views enable users to track their finances and understand their financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

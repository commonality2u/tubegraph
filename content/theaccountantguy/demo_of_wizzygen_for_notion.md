Wizzygen is a platform designed to generate [[AI content generation for Notion | AI-generated content]] directly within a [[notion_app | Notion workspace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This tool offers two primary options for content creation: within a [[notion_app | Notion page]] or a [[creating_database_in_notion | Notion database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A [[notion_app | Notion page]] is a simple blank page, while a [[creating_database_in_notion | Notion database]] is structured with rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Generating Content on a Notion Page

To generate content on a [[notion_app | Notion page]], a connection is established by naming it "Notion Page" and selecting the "Notion Page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The URL of the specific [[notion_app | Notion page]] is then copied and pasted into Wizzygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

After setting up the connection, a prompt can be entered, such as "write me a block of 100 words on Notion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Upon execution, the [[AI content generation for Notion | AI-generated content]] is populated directly onto the specified [[notion_app | Notion page]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Generating Content on a Notion Database

Wizzygen can also generate content within a [[creating_database_in_notion | Notion database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The process involves naming the connection (e.g., "Notion Database"), selecting the "Notion Database" option, and pasting the database's URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

For databases, content can be generated for multiple entries simultaneously. For example, if a database contains three topics, Wizzygen can be instructed to "write me a block of 100 words on the topic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This command triggers the AI to generate content for each topic within the database, populating the respective rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

This demonstrates how Wizzygen can be utilized to generate [[AI content generation for Notion | AI content]] efficiently for both [[notion_app | Notion pages]] and [[creating_database_in_notion | Notion databases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section, located at the bottom of the template, is used for [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses_in_notion | booking expenses]] under different expense heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

*   **Adding Details**: After adding an expense, users can input:
    *   A description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   Associate the expense to relevant accounts set up in the top section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Adding New Expense Sources/Accounts

Alternatively, clicking the "new" icon can quickly add an expense under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For example, to add a new account under the operational category, click the "new" button, then input the details and the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Anub Biswal, also known as "the accountant guy," presents a Notion template designed to track emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This template helps users monitor their emergency savings by providing a comprehensive overview of their financial safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template is structured into three main sections visible at the top:
1.  **Fund Setup:** Where individual emergency funds are defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
2.  **Savings Overview:** Provides a summary of all savings made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section:** Reflects all savings and required contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Fund Setup

The "Fund Setup" section allows users to categorize and define their emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

#### Categories
The template comes with three predefined categories:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

Users can edit these categories or add new ones by clicking on the edit option or "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

#### Adding a New Fund
To add a new fund, click the "Add Fund" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A new fund will automatically appear under the "No Classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Users can then move it to the desired category using the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

#### Fund Details
Each fund requires specific details to be entered by clicking the pencil icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
*   **Fund Detail:** A descriptive name for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance:** The initial amount in the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   **Start Date:** The date when contributions to the fund began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The template automatically calculates savings made to date from this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Target End Date:** The desired date by which the total emergency fund amount should be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Contribution Section

The "Contribution" section is where users record monthly contributions to their emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Contributions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

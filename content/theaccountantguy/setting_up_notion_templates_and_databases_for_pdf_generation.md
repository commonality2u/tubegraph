[[using_notion_templates_and_databases_for_pdf_creation | PDF documents]] can be generated in bulk using a Notion template and a Notion database with a tool like PDF output.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This process involves preparing your Notion workspace, connecting it to the PDF output tool, and mapping your data.

## Template and Database Structure

To effectively [[creating_notion_templates_and_databases_for_pdf_generation | create Notion templates and databases for PDF generation]], specific structural considerations are required:

*   **Notion Template Design**: The template should include elements enclosed in curly braces `{}`. These bracketed elements act as placeholders that will be replaced by data from your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Notion Database Setup**: A corresponding database is needed where each column header exactly matches the bracketed elements in your template, including spacing and capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Each row in this database represents a distinct document to be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Utilizing PDFoutput.com

PDFoutput.com is a tool designed to facilitate the bulk [[using_notion_database_and_templates_for_pdf_generation | generation of PDF documents]] from Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Initial Setup

1.  **Login**: Access PDFoutput.com and log in to your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
2.  **Duplicate Templates and Databases**:
    *   Navigate to the "Templates" section within PDF Output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   Locate the desired template (e.g., payment receipts) and its corresponding database link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   Click the "Duplicate" option for both the template and the database to add them to your local Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Ensure they are duplicated to the correct Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
3.  **Connect Notion to PDF Output**:
    *   On the PDF Output dashboard, click to add a database or template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   Grant permission by selecting your Notion workspace and then choosing the duplicated template and database pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
    *   The tool will then authenticate and connect the chosen Notion database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Mapping Data and Generating PDFs

1.  **Name the Connection**: Provide a name for your connection (e.g., "payment receipts") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
2.  **Verify Data Mapping**: PDF Output will automatically populate database properties and map them to the template elements if the naming conventions (including spaces and capitalization) are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   If there are any mismatches, you can manually map them by searching for the corresponding element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
    *   Filter and sorting options are available to manage properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
3.  **Create PDF**: Once mapping is confirmed, click "Create PDF" to initiate the [[generating_pdf_invoices_in_bulk_using_a_notion_database | bulk PDF generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The tool will process each row in your database to generate a separate PDF document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
4.  **Review and Download**: After successful export, you can preview a sample PDF or download all generated documents in a zip file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Advanced Features and Considerations

*   **Connections**: View previously created connections to quickly reload your database and template for subsequent generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Templates Library**: Explore a variety of predefined templates for different use cases, such as invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Upgrade Options**: Free plans include a "made with PDF output" watermark; upgrading to paid plans removes it and offers higher limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Settings**: Define page formats (e.g., A4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> and add additional templates and databases after the initial setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Feedback**: Use the feedback feature for any questions or issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Custom Templates**: Instructions are available for [[connecting_notion_templates_with_pdf_output | using custom PDF documents]] without relying on predefined templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

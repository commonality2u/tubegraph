This article explores how a monthly budget planner can be utilized for [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_against_set_budgets | budgeting for each month]] and [[tracking_finances_expenses_and_investments | tracking finances, expenses, and investments]] over various periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Overview of Planner Views

The planner offers four primary views to help users [[monitoring_budgeted_payments_and_finances | monitor their financial performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:

1.  **Expenses Overview**: Displays individual expenses with their [[overview_of_total_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | total expense amount]], budgeted amount, [[calculating_budgeted_versus_actual_expenses | percentage of total budgeted amount incurred as an expense]], and a [[monitoring_budget_versus_actual_expenses | status indicating whether the budget was exceeded or if expenses are under budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  **Monthly Overview**: Presents all discussed expenses in a monthly format, allowing users to see them at a glance for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
3.  **Yearly Overview**: Provides the same information as the monthly overview but presented in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
4.  **Summary Section**: Offers a [[managing_and_tracking_income_and_expenses | complete expense overlook]] in a yearly format, combining all expenses to provide an overview of overall financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Entering Transaction Details

To utilize the planner, users input information into the expense details database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. All expenses are categorized by month, with months sorted in descending order (later months appearing at the top) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

When entering a transaction:
*   **Date**: Any date can be entered (e.g., February 1, 2024), and the system automatically adjusts to the correct month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Expense Detail**: A description of the expense (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Period**: Select the specific month and year (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Users can add new periods if not displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Year**: Select the relevant year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Category**: Choose the type of expense (e.g., Utilities, Shopping, Entertainment, Food Expenses). Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Expense Code**: Used to segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "Utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Expense Amount**: This column is used to book the actual expense amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Setting Budgets ([[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | Setting and Tracking Budgeted Expenses]])

At the start of each month, users can [[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | set a budget]] for specific expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Select the date (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Enter the expense name for which the budget is being set (e.g., "Food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Select the period (e.g., February) and the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   Select the category (e.g., Food) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For budget setting, the expense name and category name should remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   Set the expense code, which includes the category and the month/year (e.g., "Food Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   Input the budget amount in the **Budget Amount** column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once a budget is set and expenses are continually entered, all figures in the overview sections are automatically updated, providing a clear picture of [[monitoring_budgeted_payments_and_finances | how the month is progressing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Data

The planner allows for detailed analysis of financial information after expenses are booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>:

*   **Period View**: Clicking on a specific period (e.g., Feb 2024) reveals all transactions booked for that period, detailing both expense and budget amounts, providing a quick glance at [[tracking_finances_expenses_and_investments | finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Year View**: Clicking on the year provides a similar view, showing the budgeted amount, expense amount, [[calculating_budgeted_versus_actual_expenses | expenses as a percentage]], and the [[monitoring_budget_versus_actual_expenses | status of the budget]] for the entire year, along with all yearly transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Category View**: Users can see how much expense has been booked for a particular category, including the expense amount, budgeted amount, percentage, and [[monitoring_budget_versus_actual_expenses | status]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It also lists all transactions related to that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View**: This allows users to see how much has been booked for a specific category within a particular month compared to the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

These views enable users to [[tracking_finances_expenses_and_investments | understand their finances]] and [[tracking_finances_expenses_and_investments | keep track of what is happening with their finances]] through the four different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

[[Creating and managing Notion pages and databases with Wizzygen | Wizzygen]] is a platform designed to help users generate AI-powered content directly onto their Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It offers the ability to create content on both Notion pages and Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. A Notion page is defined as a simple, blank page within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Generating AI Content on a Notion Page

To generate AI content on a Notion page using [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Wizzygen]], follow these steps:

1.  **Name the Connection**
    *   Provide a name for the connection being built, such as "notion page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  **Select Page Type**
    *   Choose the "Notion page" option from the available selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  **Provide Page URL**
    *   Copy the URL of the desired Notion page and paste it into the URL section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   Click "next" to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
4.  **Input Content Prompt**
    *   Enter a prompt describing the content you wish to generate. For example, "write me a block of 100 words on notion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
5.  **Generate Content**
    *   Once the prompt is entered, the AI will generate content directly onto the specified Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

This process allows for quick AI content generation on a Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. In addition to pages, [[creating_and_managing_notion_pages_and_databases_with_wizzygen | Wizzygen]] can also be used for [[creating_content_in_notion_databases | creating content in Notion databases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This article focuses on [[setting_up_a_finance_tracker_in_notion | setting up a finance tracker in Notion]] and customizing a Net Worth Tracker template, as well as general customization tips for [[notion_finance_templates | Notion finance templates]].

## Introduction to the Net Worth Tracker

The Net Worth Tracker template in Notion is designed to help users monitor their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It is one of many [[notion_finance_templates | Notion finance templates]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Sections of the Net Worth Tracker

The tracker is primarily divided into three main sections to help calculate net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:
1.  **Get Started Section**: Used for specifying your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  **Account Section**: Where you define different accounts for personal finances, including expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section**: Provides an overview of finances, displaying account closing balances and their proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This section also includes a dedicated Net Worth section to show the total net worth calculation, difference from goal, growth, and percentage of goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
4.  **Transactions View**: A dedicated section to record all income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, which feeds into the net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Customizing Your Net Worth Goal

To begin [[how_to_set_up_and_use_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | setting up and using your personal finance tracker in Notion]], you can set your net worth goal in the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The default goal can be edited by clicking on the amount and entering your desired figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Changing this value automatically updates other related calculations in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Managing and Customizing Accounts

The "Account" section allows for managing different financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Adding New Accounts
To add a new account, scroll to the desired category (e.g., income, expense, asset, liability) and click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. A pop-up will appear for you to fill in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:
*   **Account Name**: Specify a name for the account (e.g., "Interest Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**: For assets and liabilities, you can specify an opening balance, which is the value at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Income and expenses typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Assign a tag to categorize the account (e.g., "Other Income", "Savings", "Debt Payments") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. You can use existing categories or create new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: Indicate how often payments are received or made (e.g., "Monthly", "Quarterly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. You can also add custom frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Opening Units & Asset Class**: These fields are primarily for investments.*   **Opening Units**: For investments, specify the number of units you hold (e.g., 10 units of Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Asset Class**: For investments, classify the asset as "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. These fields should be left blank for other account types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Editing Existing Accounts
To edit an already added account, click on the pencil icon next to it, which will open an edit window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. You can then modify its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. All account settings are fully customizable and can be edited at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Recording and Customizing Transactions

The "Transactions" section is where you log all financial activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Transaction Views
Transactions are categorized into four views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities, with an "All" view combining them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Views are organized by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Adding a New Transaction
To add a transaction, click "New" within the respective view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>:
*   **Date**: Select the date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Description**: Briefly describe the transaction (e.g., "Salary Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Category**: This will automatically populate based on the view (e.g., "Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Account**: Select the relevant account you created earlier (e.g., "Salary account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode**: Choose how the money was received or paid (e.g., "Bank account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Transaction Type**: Specify whether it's an "Inflow" (money coming in) or "Outflow" (money going out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Income transactions are inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, expenses are outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Assets can be both (inflow for selling, outflow for buying) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, and liabilities can be both (inflow for taking a loan, outflow for repayment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Amount**: Enter the monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Document**: Attach any relevant receipts or bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Understanding Your Financial Summary

Once accounts and transactions are entered, the "Summary" section calculates and displays your financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Finances Overview
The "Finances" view shows the current standing of all expenses, income, assets, and liabilities, including the specific amount for each account and its proportion to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Net Worth Calculation
The "Net Worth" view provides key financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>:
*   **Net Worth Goal**: The target amount you set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This value can be adjusted directly from this view, which updates all calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: Calculated as the difference between total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The gap between your Net Worth Goal and your Total Net Worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Total Growth**: Represents the closing net worth value minus the opening net worth. The opening net worth is derived from the opening balances of assets and liabilities specified in the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows how much of your net worth goal has been accomplished (Total Net Worth / Net Worth Goal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

As transactions are added, your net worth automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Upgrading to a Comprehensive Finance Tracker

Beyond just net worth, a complete template for personal finances can track more, including:
*   Debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>
*   Budgeting requirements ([[customizing_the_notion_budget_template | customizing the Notion budget template]], [[customizing_budget_tracking_templates | customizing budget tracking templates]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>
*   Subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>
*   Investments and their current value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>

This comprehensive template is available as an upgrade, accessible via a navigation pane and link within the Net Worth Tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

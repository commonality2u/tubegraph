The [[task_scheduling_for_employees_in_notion | employee schedule template]] in Notion helps organizations keep track of employee schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This template includes four different views: Employee Details, Task Schedule, Monthly View, and Employee Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Employee Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

This view lists the details of all employees along with relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

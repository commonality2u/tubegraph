The employee training expenses tracker provides a dashboard with two main views: the training overview and employee records, both useful for [[using_notion_for_managing_employee_training_records | managing employee training records]] and tracking attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Training Overview

This section offers a comprehensive look at all planned trainings. For each individual training, the dashboard displays:
*   The training date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   The employee count, indicating how many employees are supposed to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   A percentage of attendance, showing how many employees have actually attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   The training expense incurred for each training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Employee Records

The employee record section lists employees by department, allowing for easy management of [[managing_departmental_training_data | departmental training data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
For each employee, the system shows:
*   The total number of trainings they have attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For example, "Steve has attended two out of three trainings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This provides a quick overview of expected vs. attended trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Their overall percentage of attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   The next scheduled training date, which can be easily set by clicking and selecting a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The system then calculates the remaining days until that training from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Managing Employee Details
The system allows for adding new employee records by clicking the "add employee" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. New employees are initially placed under a "no department" view until assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Employee details can be edited by selecting the employee and typing out the updated information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Training Records Section

This section is dedicated to [[managing_departmental_training_data | managing individual training sessions]] and recording attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>:
*   Users can set the date for each training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   Details about the training can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Employees are selected to attend specific trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   A checkbox allows users to indicate whether specific employees have attended the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   The attendance percentage for a training automatically updates based on these selections. For instance, if three employees are supposed to attend Training One and only one has attended, the attendance record will show 33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. If all three attend, it updates to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Multiple employees can be tagged to a training, and the attendance percentage will update automatically as more are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   New training records can be added using a quick action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Expenses Overview
The dashboard also includes an [[tracking_expenses | expenses overview]] displaying the total expense incurred for all trainings, the number of trainings conducted, and the count of employees expected to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It also calculates the average expense per employee, which updates automatically with transaction details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This provides a quick overview for [[tracking_expenses_against_budget | tracking expenses against budget]].

The accounts receivable and payable tracker can be utilized to [[tracking_invoice_payments_in_notion | track]] customer and vendor balances, including invoice statuses and payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This system allows for comprehensive management of financial inflows and outflows.

## Accounts Receivable and Payable Overview

The tracker features a receivable and payable account section with four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This includes an accounts view where customer and vendor details are set up, along with opening balances and the number of invoices due against those balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Quick action buttons are available to quickly add a vendor or customer, allowing for easy editing of their details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. After adding customer or vendor details, users can input the opening balance (starting balance of receivable or payable) and pending invoices against that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Tracking Invoice Statuses

In the receivable section, all receivable accounts and their respective details are reflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For each transaction, such as an invoice raised against a customer, the "invoice status" can be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. There are three statuses available to select from, allowing users to update them as applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Similarly, in the payable section, the status of the invoice is also displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Within the transaction section, users can also specify the invoice number and its status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Tracking Invoice Payments

The system facilitates [[tracking_payment_amounts_and_due_payments | tracking payment amounts]] for invoices:
*   **Checkbox for Payment** In the receivable section, if an invoice has been paid, users can click a checkbox next to the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Balance Calculation** When an invoice is marked as paid, its amount is no longer calculated in the total outstanding balance displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Conversely, unchecking this box will automatically recalculate the outstanding balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Payable Section** A similar "paid" checkbox is available in the payable section, which also affects the calculation of outstanding amounts at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Transaction Section** In the transaction section, the very first column includes a "paid" indicator, showing if the amount has been settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. If this is clicked, the amount will not be reflected in the total balances for the concerned person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Impact on Balances and Summaries

For each customer, an outstanding amount is reflected at the top, showing the amount due as of the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. A summary section provides an overall view of all transactions carried out, reflecting total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. These figures are calculated from all transactions entered in the sections below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

A quarterly summary is also available, combining data for all quarters to show total receivable, total payable, and net balance for each period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The total amount is also reflected at the top of this section, offering a quarterly overview of receivable and payable activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Adding Transactions

The transaction section is divided into three segments: receivable, payable, and quarterly summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. When details such as date, period, description, account name (receivable or payable), amount, invoice number, and invoice status are entered, the system automatically updates information across all relevant sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Quick action buttons are available to add a new receivable entry or payable entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. When a receivable entry is added, it picks up the current date, and users can then input the necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The system categorizes these details into months, with the latest month appearing at the top, and indicates the number of transactions for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

The primary dashboard of the [[using_notion_for_bill_tracking | Notion bills tracker]] provides an overview of various aspects of bill management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This dashboard is the main interface for users to monitor their financial obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Summary Section

The [[summary_section_of_notion_bills_tracker | summary section]] of the dashboard is divided into three key subsections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:

*   **Upcoming Bills**
    This subsection displays bills that are due soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. For each upcoming bill, it shows the amount due, the due date, the number of days remaining until payment is due, and the current payment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Clicking on a bill's status can update it to "paid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Past Due Bills**
    This section highlights bills that have not been paid by their due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It includes the expense amount, the original due date, the number of days past due, and the payment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Bills Paid**
    This area lists all bills that have been successfully paid on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Details shown include the amount, due date, and the bill's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Bills Distribution by Priority

This section categorizes bills based on their priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Bills are classified into low, medium, or high priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For each priority level, the dashboard shows the total amount of expenses incurred and the percentage of bills paid within that priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Bills Distribution by Category

Bills are also distributed across six predefined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>:

*   Entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

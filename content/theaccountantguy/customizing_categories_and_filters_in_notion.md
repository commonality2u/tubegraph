The Notion budgeting tracker template offers various options to fulfill budgeting needs, providing an overview of income, expenses, debts, bills, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Each of these five components allows users to specify targeted or budgeted amounts, such as a goal amount for income or a budget amount for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. As expenses are incurred, the tracker automatically updates, displaying the percentage of the budgeted amount spent and a "budget status" indicating if the expense is within or beyond the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Customizing Categories

The template provides an overview of different elements for each component, visible through a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. For income, this overview shows specific income amounts, goal amounts, and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Adding and Editing Categories

Users can add as many categories as they choose for each component (e.g., salary, side hustle, other sources for income; food, entertainment, shopping for expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. These new categories will automatically update in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Existing categories can also be edited by clicking on them within the entry details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This flexibility allows for detailed [[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | customization of expense categories]] and other financial classifications.

### Transaction Input and Coding

Transactions are entered via quick buttons for income, expense, debt, bills, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For each transaction, users input details such as the item/description, date, month, year, category, and a unique "code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

*   **Category:** Specifies the type of income or expense (e.g., "Food" for expenses, "Salary" for income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Code:** This field is used to collate specific sources across different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. For example, "Salary Feb 24" can be used to track salary for February 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. New codes can be created as needed when typing them in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount:** At the start of each month, a budget amount can be set for each specific source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount:** The actual income or expense amount is entered as the month progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Currency Customization

The currency format can be changed from the default dollar to any other preferred currency within Notion's number format options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Filtering Data

The tracker provides summaries that include month-wise divisions for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Dynamic Filtration

All data views in the template support dynamic filtering for specific years and months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
To apply filters:
1.  Click the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
2.  Add a filter for "Year" or "Month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
3.  Select the desired year or month from the options, or type in a specific value (e.g., "Jan" to see all January data across years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Funds Balance Overview

The "Funds Balance" section provides a monthly summary of total income, total spending, and the remaining balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Spending includes expenses, debt payments, bills, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This view also supports dynamic filtering by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

For specific [[customizing_notion_templates | customization needs]] beyond the default options, assistance is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

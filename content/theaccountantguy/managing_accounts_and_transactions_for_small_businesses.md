This article outlines how to set up and utilize a small business bookkeeping template in Notion to [[business_tracking_solutions | keep track of all bookkeeping needs]] for a small business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Template Overview
The template is organized into three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:
1.  **Start Here**: Used for initial setup and entering business-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  **Summary**: Provides an overview of all entered transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
3.  **Transactions Window**: Where all business [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transaction details are entered]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Getting Started: The "Start Here" Section

### Accounts Setup
The "Start Here" section includes an account section where you can categorize and manage your financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. These are divided into major financial heads:
*   Expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   Liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   Assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>

Under each head, different accounts are preset, such as Purchase Expense, Utility Bills, Subscription, Salaries and Wages for expenses, and Accounts Payable, Taxes Payable, Accrued Expenses, Credit Card for liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

You can modify existing items by clicking the pencil icon to edit details, or delete items using the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. To add new items, click "new page" under the respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

For every account, you can configure the following properties:
*   **Opening Balance**: Enter any carried-forward balances, especially for liabilities and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **[[classifying_accounts_for_financial_tracking | Classification]]**: Classify the account as bills, debt, savings, or other types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. For example, utility bills might be classified as "bills" and subscriptions as "subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: Specify how often payments occur (e.g., monthly, half-yearly, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**: Record starting units for inventory or assets when beginning the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Asset Class**: Choose between "inventory" or "investment" for asset accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Entering Transactions: The "Transactions Window"

The "Transactions Window" allows you to [[entering_transactions_and_managing_accounts_in_notion | add income, expense, asset, and liability transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Adding an Income Transaction
When you click "add income," a new transaction entry is automatically created with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Key fields to complete for each transaction include:
*   **Period**: Map the transaction to a specific month and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief explanation of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Category**: Automatically mapped (e.g., "income" if you clicked "add income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Account**: Select from the accounts set up in the "Start Here" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. New accounts added here will also appear in the "Start Here" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode**: How the payment was received or made (e.g., Bank Account, Cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Additional payment modes can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Transaction Type**: Designate as "inflow" (money coming in) or "outflow" (money going out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

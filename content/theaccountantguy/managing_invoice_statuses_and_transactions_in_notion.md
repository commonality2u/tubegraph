The Notion accounts receivable and payable tracker helps manage customer and vendor balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It provides a comprehensive system for [[tracking_invoice_payments_in_notion | tracking invoice payments]], monitoring outstanding amounts, and viewing overall financial summaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Accounts Receivable and Payable Section

This section, located at the top of the tracker, offers four different views to manage financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Accounts View
In the accounts view, you can set up details for your customers and vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This includes their opening balances and the number of invoices due against those balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

*   **Adding Accounts**:
    *   Customers and vendors can be added using quick action buttons on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
    *   Clicking "ADD vendor" or "ADD customer" creates a new entry, which can then be edited via a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Initial Setup**: After adding an account, you can input the opening balance (starting balance of receivable or payable) and the number of invoices pending against this amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Receivable Section
This section displays all receivable accounts along with their transaction details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

*   **Invoice Tracking**: It shows individual transactions, such as invoices raised against customers, including the date and invoice number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Invoice Status**: The "invoice status" field allows you to change the status of each invoice. Three status options are available to reflect the applicable case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Payment Tracking**: A checkbox indicates if an invoice has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. When checked, the paid amount is not included in the outstanding balance calculation at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Unchecking it will recalculate the outstanding balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Outstanding Balance**: For each customer, the total outstanding amount is reflected at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Payable Section
Similar to the receivable section, the payable section provides details for vendor transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It displays the date of the invoice, invoice number, status, and the amount raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The paid checkbox functions identically, helping to determine outstanding payable balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Summary Section
This section offers an overall summary of all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It reflects the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance, calculated from all recorded transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Transaction Section
The transaction section is divided into three segments: Receivable, Payable, and Quarterly Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Receivable Transactions
This segment tracks individual receivable entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Data Fields**: Each entry includes:
    *   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
    *   Period (selectable from four quarterly options) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
    *   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
    *   Account Name (customer name) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
    *   Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
    *   Invoice Number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
    *   Status of the invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
*   **Automatic Updates**: Once these details are entered, they automatically update across the entire system, including the receivable section described above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Paid Status**: A "paid" checkbox in the first column indicates if the amount has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. If checked, it will not be included in the total balances for the concerned person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Quick Entry**: Use the "Add receivable entry" button on the left to quickly add a new receivable transaction with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Organization**: Entries are categorized by month, with later months appearing at the top. A number indicates the count of transactions for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Payable Transactions
This segment functions similarly to receivable transactions but for payable entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The "Add payable entry" button allows for quick addition of new payable details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary
This section provides an overview of financial activity aggregated by quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For each quarter, it displays the total receivable amount, total payable amount, and the net balance (receivable minus payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The total amount for all quarters is also reflected at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

This comprehensive tracker allows users to quickly add new customer or vendor details and gain a quick overview of all receivable and payable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

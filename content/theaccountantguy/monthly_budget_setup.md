The personal finance tracker, developed in a Google Sheet, includes a dedicated "Monthly Budget" tab designed for setting and tracking monthly financial inflows and outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This tab helps users monitor all expenses and income, providing a clear overview of their financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Monthly Budget Tab Overview
The [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | Monthly Budget]] tab is structured with an expenses overview on the left and an income overview on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Highlighted areas within the tracker are automatically computed based on the data entered in the transactions area, so they do not require manual editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

#### Setting Up Expenses
To [[setting_budget_categories | set up expenses]]:
1.  **Input Expenses**: Begin by listing all recurring monthly expenses, such as gas bills, Wi-Fi bills, and phone bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
2.  **Specify Month/Date**: For each expense, select the corresponding month or a specific date within that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Double-clicking allows you to set any date for a particular month, which then updates for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
3.  **Set Budgeted Amount**: Enter the [[setting_and_adjusting_budgeted_amounts | budgeted amount]] for each expense category for the given month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
4.  **Track Performance**: The system automatically displays the actual expenses incurred, the difference between the budgeted and actual amounts, and indicates whether you are "under budget" or "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

To make an expense entry, navigate to the transactions area, select the date, choose the expense category from a dropdown, and input the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The actual expense figures for the month will update dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, reflecting your spending immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

#### Setting Up Income
The income section operates on principles similar to the expense section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Users can specify all income sources for respective months and set a targeted income amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. As entries are made, the income figures automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

#### Dynamic Overviews
The left side of the monthly budget tab provides a dynamic overview of expenses and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This includes:
*   **Total Budgeted Amount**: Calculated from the total budgeted amounts set for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Total Expenses Incurred**: The actual spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The variance between budgeted and actual amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

A graphical presentation of expenses is also available, with the left bar indicating the budgeted amount and the right bar showing the actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Changes in expense entries automatically update the graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Similarly, an income overview on the right displays the total targeted income, the actual income achieved, and the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. A graph illustrates the targeted income (left) versus actual income (right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This [[budgeting_and_savings_strategy | monthly budget]] tab is helpful for managing all types of expenses, including bills and subscriptions, as well as tracking all sources of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

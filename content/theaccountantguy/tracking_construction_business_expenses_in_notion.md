A specialized [[using_notion_as_an_expense_tracker | Notion template]] allows users to [[using_notion_for_business_expense_tracking | track business expenses]] specifically related to construction projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This template provides an efficient way to monitor project expenditures in one centralized location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Template Overview

The [[using_notion_as_an_expense_tracker | Notion template]] organizes expenses with distinct categories defined at the top of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each category, the template displays both a budgeted expense amount and the actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Users can modify values in this table, and the expense figures at the top will update dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Changing values in the bottom table instantly reflects updates corresponding to the categories at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

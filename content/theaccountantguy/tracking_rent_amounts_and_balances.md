This article demonstrates the use of a template designed for [[house_rent_payments_tracking_with_notion | tracking house rent payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It enables users to keep a clear record of rental payments and manage tenant information effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Overview of the Tracker

The template features a summary section at the top with four distinct views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:

### 1. Basic Information
This view allows for the addition of fundamental details, including tenants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Tenants can be classified under different property types owned, such as "apartment" or "duplex," with options to add custom classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

*   **Adding Tenants**: A dedicated "ADD tenant" button automatically creates a new tenant entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. New entries can then be dragged and placed under their respective property categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Detailed tenant information is entered by clicking a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### 2. Property Section
This section displays various property classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Under each property, the names of associated tenants are listed along with key financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

For each tenant, the following rent details are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>:
*   Total rent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   Rent amount that has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   Balance rent amount that is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Advanced rent that has been paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

### 3. [[viewing_rental_history_and_transactions | Rental History]]
This view provides a comprehensive rental history for all tenants who have made payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This history is compiled directly from the transactions logged at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### 4. Final Summary Section
A concise summary of overall rent collection and outstanding amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>:
*   Total amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   Amount that has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Outstanding rent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   [[tracking_transactions_and_payment_percentages | Percentage of rent collected]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

## Transaction Management

The transaction section offers three distinct views for [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | managing rental transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>:

*   **Rent Paid**: Displays all transactions where rent has been successfully paid, along with the respective tenants and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Rent Due**: Shows information for rent amounts that are due and have not yet been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Checking a box in this view marks the rent as paid, moving it to the "Rent Paid" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Quarterly Summary**: Provides a summary of rental payments and collections, including the balance due for each month within a given quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

To quickly add a new rental payment, a dedicated button is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

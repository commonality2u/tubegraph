The Monthly Budget Planner is a tool designed to help users manage their finances by [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_against_set_budgets | budgeting]] for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This system provides various views to track spending and adherence to budgets.

## Overview of the Budget Planner

The planner features four main views:
*   **Expenses Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Monthly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Yearly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Summary of All Expenses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

To utilize the planner, users enter information into the expense details database, which then calculates all incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Expenses Overview
This view displays a list of expense categories, such as Shopping, Entertainment, Food, and Utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For each category, it shows:
*   Total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Percentage of total budgeted amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   A status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or if spending is under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

### Monthly Overview
This section presents all discussed expenses in a monthly format, allowing users to see all expenses for a specific month at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Yearly Overview
Similar to the monthly overview, this view provides the same expense information but presented in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Summary Section
The summary section offers a complete expense overview in a year format, grouping all expenses together to provide a performance snapshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## [[adding_and_editing_expense_categories | Setting Up Expense Categories]] and [[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | Budgets]]

The system allows for [[creating_an_expense_categories_system | setting up]] and [[managing_and_editing_expense_sources_and_categories | managing expense categories]]. Initially, categories like Shopping, Entertainment, Food, and Utilities are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, but users can [[adding_and_editing_expense_categories | add their own categories]] as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### [[adding_and_categorizing_expenses | Entering Expenses]]

To [[adding_and_categorizing_expenses | add an expense]] transaction:
1.  Navigate to the "expense details" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Expenses are organized by month in descending order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  Click "new" to create a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
3.  **Date**: Enter the date of the expense (e.g., February 1, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The system automatically adjusts the month based on the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
4.  **Expense Detail**: Type in a description for the expense (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
5.  **Period**: Select the relevant month and year (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Users can add new periods if not already displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
6.  **Year**: Select the year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
7.  **Category**: Choose the type of expense from existing categories (e.g., "Utilities") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. New categories can be added here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
8.  **Expense Code**: This code helps segregate expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
9.  **Expense Amount**: Input the actual amount spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### [[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | Setting Budgets]]

To [[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | set a budget]] for a specific expense category at the beginning of a month:
1.  In the expense details, select the start date of the month (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  **Expense Name**: Enter the expense for which the budget is being set (e.g., "Food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  **Period**: Select the month (e.g., "February") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  **Year**: Select the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
5.  **Category**: Select the corresponding category (e.g., "Food category") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For setting budgets, the expense name and category name should generally be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
6.  **Expense Code**: Set the expense code as the category followed by the month and year (e.g., "food Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
7.  **Budget Amount**: Enter the budgeted amount in the dedicated "budget amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This column is distinct from the "expense amount" column, which is used for booking actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Once a budget is set, all figures on the top views (Expenses Overview, Monthly, Yearly, Summary) automatically update for the respective months and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Data

After [[adding_and_categorizing_expenses | booking expenses]] and [[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | setting budgets]], the system provides various ways to analyze financial performance:

*   **Period View**: Clicking on a period (e.g., Feb 2024) reveals a new window showing all transactions booked for that period, including amounts and whether each entry was a budget or an actual expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This offers a quick glance at finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Year View**: Clicking on a year shows a similar view, displaying the budgeted amount, expense amount, expense as a percentage, and budget status for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It also lists all yearly transactions with their amounts and type (expense or budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Category View**: This view details how much expense has been booked for a particular category, including the expense amount, budgeted amount, expense percentage, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It also lists all related transactions within that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View**: The expense code allows users to see the amount booked for a specific category and month in comparison to the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

By continuously adding expense information, all top-level views automatically update, providing ongoing insights into monthly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

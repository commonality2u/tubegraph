This article outlines how to use a personal finance tracker spreadsheet to manage income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The spreadsheet includes three main tabs: the Dashboard, Transactions, and Budget tabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. A "Start Here" tab provides initial instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## [[Monthly Budget Tracking | Setting Up Your Budget]]

The first step in [[using_notion_for_financial_tracking | personal finance tracking]] is to navigate to the "Budget" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Here, you will input details for accounts related to your income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Defining Accounts and Budgeted Amounts
You need to specify a budgeted amount for each month, whether it's for budgeted expenses or income goals for the respective accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Accounts should be categorized as either income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The "Goal amount" column is formula-driven and automatically totals the amounts entered for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

> [!TIP] Adding New Line Items
> When adding new line items, ensure you drag the formula from the "Goal amount" column down to the new entries so it copies correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. To add more rows, simply select the desired number of rows (e.g., 10 rows) and click "Add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## [[Tracking and Summarizing Business Finances | Recording Transactions]]

After setting up your budget estimations in the "Budget" tab, the next step is to add new transactions in the "Transactions" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Entering Transaction Details
In the "Transactions" tab, you will enter:
*   **Date:** The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Details:** A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Category:** Select the category from the accounts you previously added in the "Budget" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Income/Expense Type (Column E):** This column is formula-driven and indicates whether the transaction is an income or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Amount:** The monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Formula Copying
> Similar to the "Budget" tab, when adding new line items to the "Transactions" tab, drag the formula in column E down to the new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## [[Dashboard analysis for personal finance | Analyzing Your Finances]]

Once transactions are added, you can navigate to the "Dashboard" section to view the analysis of your income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Dashboard Features
The dashboard allows for dynamic analysis controlled by filters such as:
*   **Category:** Filter by specific income or expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Period:** Select a specific time frame, such as the entire year (e.g., 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Type of Reference:** Choose whether to view income, expenses, or both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Key information displayed on the dashboard includes:
*   **Summary:** Total income, total expense amount, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Income Overview:** Breakdown of different sources of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Expenses Overview:** Breakdown of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Monthly Personal Finance Overview:** Income and expense details for each month, including the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Status Callout:** Indicates whether expenses have exceeded the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

By adjusting the filters, you can gain insights into specific aspects of your finances, such as total income for a period or details for a particular income source like salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This powerful analysis tool allows for comprehensive [[portfolio_tracker | financial overview]] and [[mortgage_payment_tracking | tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

The personal finance tracker includes a dedicated "Sinking Fund Analysis" tab to help users manage and track their contributions towards various savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This section of the tracker operates similarly to the [[setting_budget_goals_and_tracking_progress | monthly budget]] tab, allowing for detailed tracking of contributions and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Setup and Input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
To set up a sinking fund, users need to specify the following information:
*   **Sinking Fund Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
*   **Goal Amount**: The total target amount for each sinking fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Monthly Contribution**: The amount the user intends to contribute monthly to each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Starting Sinking Fund Amount**: Any amount already saved for a specific fund at the time of setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. For example, if a home renovation fund has a $5,000 goal and a $400 monthly contribution, it might start with an existing $2,800 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Tracking and Analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>
The tracker automatically computes and displays key metrics for each sinking fund based on user entries:
*   **Amount Saved So Far**: Calculated from the entries made in the transactions section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Amount Left to Save**: The remaining amount needed to reach the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Total Progress**: The percentage of the goal amount achieved, calculated as total savings divided by the goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Estimated Completion Date and Months**: An estimated date and number of months to complete the fund, assuming consistent monthly contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Transaction Entry
On the right side of the "Sinking Fund Analysis" tab, users can record transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. To make an entry, users simply specify the date, select the relevant fund from a dropdown menu, and enter the contribution amount for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Sinking Fund Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
A dynamic overview on the left side of the tab summarizes the overall status of all sinking funds:
*   **Total Saving Fund Goal**: The combined total of all individual sinking fund goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Total Savings Made So Far**: The cumulative amount saved across all sinking funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Total Savings Left**: The total remaining amount needed to reach all sinking fund goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Visual Representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
A graph visually represents the progress for each sinking fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The green bar indicates the total savings made, while the black bar shows the amount still needed to reach the goal for each specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This offers a quick visual representation of savings progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Reporting Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
The reporting section of the personal finance tracker allows users to generate dynamic reports for sinking funds, similar to other financial categories like expenses and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Users can select "Sinking Fund Details" from a dropdown menu and choose a specific month to view the total amounts and percentage allocations for their sinking funds during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This feature helps in analyzing finances at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

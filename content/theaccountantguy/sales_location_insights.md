The "Sales Performance OS" template includes a component dedicated to understanding sales performance by location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:000">[00:04:000]</a>. This feature provides insights into where sales are being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:800">[01:11:800]</a>.

## Overview and Statistics

Within the sales dashboard, the sales location component displays key statistics on sales made to different geographical areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:800">[01:11:800]</a>. For each location, the following information is available:
*   Sales achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:900">[01:16:900]</a>
*   Targeted sales set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:900">[01:16:900]</a>
*   Percentage of targeted sales achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:900">[01:16:900]</a>
*   Status indicating whether the target was met ("Target achieved") or not ("Target not achieved") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:900">[01:16:900]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:000">[00:37:000]</a>.

These insights are broken down by month, allowing for a monthly view of sales performance per location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:000">[01:20:000]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:000">[01:31:000]</a>.

### Sales Location Overview Section

A dedicated "Sales Location Overview" section provides a consolidated view of location-based performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:400">[02:02:400]</a>. This section displays:
*   Total sales made to each location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:500">[02:06:500]</a>
*   Average sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:500">[02:08:500]</a>
*   Sale units (how many units were sold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:500">[02:08:500]</a>

This overview helps in [[tracking_sales_performance_by_salesperson | tracking sales performance]] and provides insights into the overall business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:700">[02:10:700]</a>.

## Tracking Sales Transactions by Location

Sales location information is integrated into the [[sales_transactions_and_customization_in_notion | sales transactions]] input process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:000">[02:19:000]</a>. When entering a transaction, you can specify the sales location details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:000">[02:34:000]</a>.

### Setting Targets and Entering Data
*   **Location Tag**: For every location, a unique "location tag" is specified, which includes the location name, month, and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:300">[03:37:300]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:200">[04:41:200]</a>.
*   **Targeted Sales**: At the beginning of each month, users can set targeted sales amounts for each individual location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:300">[04:05:300]</a>.
*   **Sale Amount**: As sales are made, the actual sale amount is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:900">[04:43:900]</a>.

### Quick Actions
A "quick action button" allows users to automatically assign targets for a particular month for sales locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:000">[05:11:000]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:100">[05:17:100]</a>.

### Customization and Filtering
The dashboard is customizable, allowing users to change the currency for all amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:900">[07:34:900]</a>. Users can also filter the data by year or month to view performance for specific periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:300">[08:15:300]</a>. For example, filtering by a specific year will display all months relevant to that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:700">[08:46:700]</a>.

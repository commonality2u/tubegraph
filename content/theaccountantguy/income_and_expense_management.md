Effective personal finance management is achieved by tracking income and expenses using a structured system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This approach allows for a comprehensive overview of financial activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## System Overview

A personal finance tracker typically includes three main sections:
*   **Net Worth Target:** To set a target for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Account Section:** To specify different accounts under income, expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Summary Section:** Provides an at-a-glance view of all finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts for Income and Expenses

To begin [[classifying_and_managing_income_and_expenses | tracking income and expenses]], navigate to the "Account" section in the 'Get Started' view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This section lists all income and expense accounts relevant to personal finances, such as salary, side income, groceries, utility bills, and subscriptions like Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Adding and Modifying Accounts
*   **Modify Existing Accounts:** Click the "edit" button on an existing account to open a modification panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Add New Accounts:** Click the "new" button to set up a new account for income or expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Account Details:** When creating a new account, specify the account name and optionally an opening balance (though income and expense accounts typically do not have one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Classifying and Categorizing Accounts
Expenses can be classified according to specific requirements, such as "Bills" (e.g., groceries, utility bills) or "Subscriptions" (e.g., Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Other classifications include "Savings" and "Debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Payment Frequency
Set a payment frequency for expenses, indicating how often a payment is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Examples include monthly for utility bills or annually for certain subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Recording Income and Expense Transactions

After setting up accounts, transactions are entered in the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This view offers five perspectives: an "All" view for all transaction types (asset, liability, income, expense) and specific views for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Steps to Enter a Transaction
1.  **Navigate:** Go to the relevant section (e.g., "Income" for income transactions or "Expense" for expense transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
2.  **Click "New":** To open a new transaction window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
3.  **Date Selection:** Choose the transaction date. Transactions are automatically bifurcated by month, with later months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
4.  **Description:** Add a brief description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
5.  **Category:** The category is usually pre-filled based on the view selected (e.g., "income" if in the Income view) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
6.  **Account:** Link the transaction to a specific account (e.g., "Salary" for income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
7.  **Payment Mode:** Select how the money was received or paid (e.g., "bank" or "cash") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
8.  **Transaction Type:**
    *   **Inflow:** For income transactions where money comes into the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   **Outflow:** For expense transactions where money goes out of the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
9.  **Amount:** Enter the transaction amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Tracking Income and Expenses in the Summary View

Once transactions are entered, the "Summary" view, specifically the "Finances" section, provides an overview of income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Total Income/Expenses:** Reflects the total amount earned or spent based on recorded transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Bifurcation and Contribution:** Shows the percentage contribution of each income or expense head to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Any changes in transaction amounts are quickly reflected in the summary view, including updated percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This provides [[dynamic_updates_of_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | dynamic updates of budgeted and actual expenses]].

## Budgeting

The "Budget" section under the "Summary" view helps set and track estimated income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. It shows incurred expenses and income, reflecting their percentage against the set budget targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Users can easily adjust budget amounts, and the percentages will update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This enables [[income_and_expense_tracking_with_budget_targets | income and expense tracking with budget targets]] and [[monthly_budget_management_and_updates | monthly budget management and updates]].

## Managing Funds and Balance Tracking

The tracker allows for [[managing_funds_and_balance_tracking | managing funds and balance tracking]] for various financial aspects beyond just income and expenses:

### Debt Payments
*   **Setup:** Debt accounts are set up under "Liabilities" in the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Users specify debt names, opening balances, classify them as "Debt," and set a payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Transactions:** Debt payments are recorded under the "Liability" section of "Transactions." Repayments are recorded as "outflow" transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Taking on new loans is recorded as an "inflow" transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Tracking:** The "Debt" view in the "Summary" section shows upcoming and past payments, indicating due dates and previous payment dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. It also displays the total loan amount, total repayment in percentage, and the amount still unpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Savings Funds
*   **Setup:** Savings funds are set up under "Assets" in the "Account" section and classified under the "Savings" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Users can set a goal amount for each savings fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   **Transactions:** Transactions for savings are added under the "Asset" section of "Transactions." Money transferred to a savings account is an "outflow" transaction from the bank account, being added to the savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
*   **Tracking:** The "Savings" section in the "Summary" view reflects the total saved amount, goal amount, and savings in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

### Bills
*   **Setup:** Bills are categorized as expenses under the "Account" section and classified as "Bills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. A payment frequency (e.g., monthly) is also set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
*   **Transactions:** Bill payments are entered under the "Expense" section of "Transactions" as "outflow" transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.
*   **Tracking:** The "Bills" section under "Summary" displays upcoming and past bill payments, similar to debt tracking, indicating the next due date or if a payment was missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

### Subscriptions
*   **Setup:** Subscriptions are categorized as expenses under the "Account" section and classified as "Subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. A payment frequency (e.g., annual, quarterly) is set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
*   **Transactions:** Subscription payments are entered under the "Expense" section of "Transactions" as "outflow" transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **Tracking:** The "Subscription" view in the "Summary" section shows upcoming and past subscription payments, due dates, and the subscription status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

## Net Worth Tracking

Net worth is the difference between assets and liabilities at the end of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

### Setting a Net Worth Goal
In the "Net Worth Goal" section, users specify a target net worth to achieve by the end of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

### Tracking Net Worth
The "Net Worth" section under the "Summary" view provides a glance at:
*   **Net Worth Goal:** The target set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth:** The current net worth, calculated as total assets minus total liabilities after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.
*   **Difference:** How much the current net worth is lagging behind the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved:** The total net worth divided by the net worth goal, showing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.
*   **Total Growth:** The closing net worth less the opening net worth (based on opening balances of assets and liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

This system provides a comprehensive view of [[classifying_and_tracking_income_expenses_assets_and_liabilities | classifying and tracking income, expenses, assets, and liabilities]], as well as [[tracking_income_expenses_and_cash_flow_movements | tracking income, expenses, and cash flow movements]].

## Additional Features and Tips

### For Couples
Couples can use this system by splitting different categories of accounts under each financial head (income, expenses, assets, liabilities) as per each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. For example, "Salary by Him" and "Side Hustle by Her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

### Viewing Specific Account Transactions
To quickly view all transactions related to a specific account (e.g., "Salary" or "Side Hustle"), simply click on that account within the "Finances" summary view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. A "View Transactions" option will appear at the bottom, which, when clicked, will populate only the transactions associated with that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.

### Template Compatibility
*   **Device Availability:** The template is available on all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Cost:** The Notion tool itself is free to use upon signing up with an email ID, with no extra charges for using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.
*   **Multiple Currencies:** Notion supports a wide range of currencies. To change the currency, navigate to any field with a currency sign (e.g., dollar sign), click on "Edit property," go to "Number format," and select the desired currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>. This needs to be done for all relevant views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

This article explains how to track and compare budgeted versus actual expenses, particularly for restaurant operations, using a specific template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Template Overview

A template is available to [[understanding_the_expenses_overview | understand and track business expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template organizes expenses into three main categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

For each category, the template displays:
*   A [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_expenses | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   The actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
    *   Actual expenses are automatically pulled from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   A percentage indicator that shows how much of the actual expenses were incurred in [[comparing_actual_vs_budgeted_expenses_and_calculating_differences | comparison to the budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Managing Expenses and Categories

### Setting Budgeted Amounts
To [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_expenses | define a new budget expense]], users can simply click on the existing budgeted value and input a new amount as required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Modifying and Adding Categories
The template allows for flexible [[adjusting_budget_and_actual_expenses | management of expense categories]]:
*   **Modifying Categories** - To modify any of the existing categories, click on the pencil icon associated with that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Changes made will automatically update throughout the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories** - A new category can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories** - To delete a category, click on the three-dot menu and select the delete option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Dynamic Updates
All expense values within the template update dynamically as figures are inputted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. For example, entering values in the expense table will instantly reflect updates at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This provides an easy way of [[managing_budget_versus_actual_expenses | managing budget versus actual expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Summary Section

The template includes a summary section that provides an [[understanding_the_expenses_overview | overview of financial performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This section displays:
*   The total [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_expenses | budgeted expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   The total actual expenses incurred, which are pulled from the detailed values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The difference between the total budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   The overall percentage of actual expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The subscription expenses tracker organizes subscriptions into various categories and views, allowing for a comprehensive overview and management of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

A "Subscription Overview" section provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Under the "categories view," subscriptions are primarily divided into two main statuses:
*   **Active Subscription** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Cancel Subscription** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

Within each of these status categories, users can view:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   The total expenses incurred for that subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   The billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>

## Expenses Section Grouping

The "Expenses" section further categorizes subscriptions into different groups based on their nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Examples of these groups include "infotainment," "education," and "music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Within each of these classifications or groups, you can see:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   The total expenses for that subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   The percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

## Customizing Subscription Categories

[[Customizing categories in Notion | Customizing categories]] within the tracker is flexible:
*   **Adding New Groups**: Users can add a new group by clicking on the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Groups**: Existing groups can be edited by clicking on them and changing the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Moving Subscriptions Between Categories**: When a new subscription is added using the quick action button, it initially appears under a "note subscription category" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. From there, it can be moved to any chosen classification, such as "active mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Transaction Section Categorization

The "Transaction section" provides views for [[tracking_subscription_transactions | tracking subscription transactions]]:
*   **Active Subscriptions View**: Displays all currently active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Cancel Subscription View**: Shows subscriptions that have been canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Within these views, subscriptions are further bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The total sum of expenses incurred for each particular month is also displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

The status of a subscription can be changed by clicking a checkbox; checking it indicates the subscription is active, while unchecking it moves it to "cancel" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

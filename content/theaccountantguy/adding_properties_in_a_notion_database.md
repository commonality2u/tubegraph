In Notion, a database is composed of a collection of properties that define the various types of data stored within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This powerful feature enables users to [[customizing_databases_in_notion | create custom databases]] for structured information management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Default Database Property
When you [[how_to_create_a_database_in_notion | create a new database]] in Notion, there is always a default property, which appears as the first column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This default property's type is always 'Title' and cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. In examples, this column is often used for the "Test Name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Required Properties for Calculations
To perform calculations, such as finding the sum of two numbers in a database, specific properties are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>:
*   Test Title property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>
*   Paper 1 [[assigning_number_properties_in_notion | number property]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>
*   Paper 2 [[assigning_number_properties_in_notion | number property]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>
*   Formula 1 Formula property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>
*   Formula 2 Formula property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>

## How to Add Properties

To add properties to a database in Notion:
1.  Click on the plus `+` symbol located at the top-right end of the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
2.  A list of options will appear, allowing you to select the desired property type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
3.  For example, select the [[assigning_number_properties_in_notion | number property]] and name it "Paper 1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
4.  To add calculation properties, add two more properties and set their type as 'Formula' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

After setting up these properties, your database will contain the necessary columns for inputting numbers and applying formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

The monthly budget tab within the personal finance tracker in [[using_google_sheets_for_finance | Google Sheets]] allows users to set and monitor their income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Layout and Key Features
The [[setting_and_monitoring_monthly_budgets | monthly budget]] tab is structured with an "expenses overview" on the left and an "income overview" on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Areas highlighted in the sheet are automatically computed based on entries made in the "transactions area" on the right side of the sheet and do not require manual editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Setting Up Expenses
To begin [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_google_sheets | tracking income and expenses]], users must first set their monthly expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This involves:
*   **Inputting expense categories** such as gas bills, Wi-Fi bills, and phone bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Setting the month** for each expense by double-clicking and selecting a date within the desired month (e.g., January 1 for January) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Defining the budgeted amount** for each expense for the respective month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For example, a budgeted amount of $1,400 for phone bills in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The sheet automatically displays the incurred expenses, the difference between the budgeted and actual amounts, and whether the user is "under budget" or "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Adding Transactions and Tracking Budget Status
To make an expense entry:
1.  Navigate to the transactions area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
2.  Select the date from the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
3.  Choose the specific expense category from a drop-down list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
4.  Enter the actual amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Once an entry is made, the actual expense amount for the corresponding month updates dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. If an expense exceeds the budgeted amount, the sheet will reflect an "over budget" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Income Tracking
The income section operates on similar principles to the expense section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Users can:
*   Set all income for respective months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Define targeted income amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   Entries in the transaction area automatically update the income overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Dynamic Overview and Graphical Presentation
The monthly budget tab provides a [[dynamic_financial_reporting_with_google_sheets | dynamic overview]] of income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This includes:
*   Total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

A graphical presentation shows the budgeted amount (left bar) versus the actual expense amount (right bar) for all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Similarly, for income, it displays the total targeted income, actual income achieved, and the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Changing expense entries updates these graphs automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

The monthly budget tab helps users manage various expenses, including bills and subscriptions, as well as track all sources of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

A personal finance tracker developed in [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_google_sheets | Google Sheets]] includes a dedicated "Monthly Budget" tab designed to help users set and monitor their income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This tab is one of five core sections in the tracker, alongside an investment dashboard, [[using_google_sheets_for_sinking_funds | sinking fund analysis]], a debt payment report, and a dynamic reporting section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

The monthly budget feature can be used for individual or business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Monthly Budget Tab Overview
The "Monthly Budget" tab is structured with an "Expenses overview" on the left and an "Income overview" on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Most highlighted fields within this tab are auto-computed based on entries made in the "transactions area" on the right side of the sheet, meaning they should not be manually edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Setting Up Expenses
To begin, users need to set their monthly expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Inputting Expense Categories and Dates** Users can input expenses like gas, Wi-Fi, and phone bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Double-clicking allows the selection of any date for a specific month, which updates the relevant monthly data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
2.  **Setting Budgeted Amounts** For each expense, a budgeted amount can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For example, a phone bill might be budgeted at $1,400 for March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The tracker then shows the incurred expenses, the difference between budgeted and actual amounts, and whether the user is "under budget" or "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
3.  **Recording Actual Expenses** To make an expense entry, users select the date, choose the expense category (e.g., "phone bills") from a dropdown, and input the actual amount spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This immediately updates the actual expense for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. If an entry exceeds the budgeted amount, the status will show "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Setting Up Income
The income section operates on principles similar to the expense section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Users can:
1.  **Set Targeted Income Amounts** for respective months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  **Make Entries** in the transactions area, which automatically updates the income overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Transaction Area and Overviews
The transaction area includes columns for:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   Details of expenses and income (selectable from a dropdown) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
*   Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>

On the left side of the "Monthly Budget" tab, a dynamic overview provides:
*   Total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
*   The difference between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
*   A graphical presentation comparing budgeted vs. actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Changes in expense entries will update this graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

On the right, an income overview shows:
*   Total targeted income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
*   Actual income achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   The positive difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
*   A graph comparing targeted vs. actual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This [[setting_and_monitoring_monthly_budgets | monthly budget]] tab is designed to help users track all bills, subscription expenses, and income, providing a clear financial picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

This article details the process of [[tracking_and_entering_transactions_in_a_business_expense_tracker | tracking and entering transactions]] into the expense details database within the monthly budget planner, allowing users to [[adding_and_managing_expenses | add and manage expenses]] and set budgets for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This database is crucial for calculating all daily incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Accessing the Expense Details Database

To begin [[utilizing_transaction_section_for_expense_booking | expense booking]], navigate to the expense details database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. All expenses within this database are categorized by month, with months sorted in descending order (later months appearing at the top) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

To enter a new transaction:
1.  Click on the "New" button within the expense details database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  **Date:** Enter the transaction date (e.g., February 1, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The system will automatically modify the month based on the date entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  **Expense Detail:** Type in the specific expense detail (e.g., "Wi-Fi expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
4.  **Period:** Select the corresponding period (e.g., "Feb 2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Users can add new periods if not already displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  **Year:** Select the relevant year (e.g., "2024") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  **Category:** Choose the type of expense from pre-defined categories (e.g., "utilities") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Users can also add their own custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
7.  **Expense Code:** Select the expense code, which segregates expenses by category and month (e.g., "utility Feb") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  **Expense Amount:** Enter the amount for the specific expense in the "Expense Amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Expense Amount vs. Budget Amount

It's important to distinguish between two columns:
*   **Expense Amount:** Used for booking specific expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount:** Used at the start of the month to set a budget for a specific expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Setting a Budget

Budgets are typically set at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. To set a budget for a specific expense:
1.  **Date:** Select the first day of the month (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  **Expense Detail:** Enter the name of the expense for which the budget is being set (e.g., "food expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  **Period & Year:** Select the relevant period and year, similar to entering a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  **Category:** Select the corresponding category (e.g., "food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   *Note:* When setting a budget, the expense name and the category name should remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
5.  **Expense Code:** Put the same category as the expense (e.g., "food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
6.  **Budget Amount:** Enter the budgeted amount in the "Budget Amount" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Impact of Data Entry

As you continuously add expense information, all figures in the overview sections of the planner are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This allows for real-time tracking of monthly progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Analyzing Entered Data

The system provides various ways to analyze your finances once data has been entered:
*   **Period View:** Clicking on a particular period will open a new window showing all booked transactions for that period, including details of the amount and whether it was a budget or an expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Year View:** Clicking on the year provides a similar view, showing budgeted amounts, expense amounts, expense percentages, budget status, and all transactions for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Category View:** This view shows total expense and budgeted amounts for a particular category, along with expense percentages and status. It also lists all category-related expenses booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Expense Code View:** Users can see the amount booked for a specific category of expense and month in comparison to the total budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

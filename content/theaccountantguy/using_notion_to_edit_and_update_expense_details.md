This article provides a guide on how to edit and update expense details within a Notion-based travel expense tracker. The system allows users to manage categories, set budgets, and log individual transactions, with all updates dynamically reflected in summary views.

### Overview of the Notion Travel Expense Tracker

The Notion travel expense tracker is designed to help users monitor travel expenses and plan future spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It features a summary section that includes accounts, expenses, and an overall financial summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This tool is part of a broader approach to [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]] and [[setting_up_income_and_expense_tracking_in_notion | setting up income and expense tracking in Notion]].

### Setting Up and Editing Expense Categories (Accounts View)

Before logging individual expenses, users can [[setting_up_income_and_expense_tracking_in_notion | set up different expense categories]] under the "accounts" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Common classifications include "travel," "meals," and "lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

#### Adding New Expense Sources
To quickly add a new expense source within an existing category, click the "add expense source" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This automatically adds a new entry to the travel category, which can then be modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

#### Modifying Expense Sources
To edit the details of an existing expense source, click the pencil icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Renaming:** For example, an expense source can be edited from a generic name to "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Setting Budgeted Amounts:** Users can set a budgeted amount for each expense source, such as $1,500 for "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Moving Categories:** To move an expense source to a different category (e.g., from "Travel" to "Meals"), click the three dots next to the expense source and place it under the desired section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

#### Creating New Expense Categories
Users can also create entirely new expense groups beyond the default "travel," "meals," and "lodging" by clicking the plus sign on the right side of the accounts view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Existing groups can also be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Booking and Updating Individual Expenses

The system classifies expenses under "travel," "meals," and "lodging" to maintain consistency with the accounts view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

#### Adding New Expenses
Quick addition buttons are available for each category (e.g., "add travel expense," "add lodging expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Clicking these buttons automatically adds a new expense entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

#### Updating Expense Details
Once an expense entry is added, users can modify its details:
*   **Description:** Add a description for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Trip Info:** Input or edit details about the specific trip, such as "trip to Paris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Existing trip info can be edited by clicking the three dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Account of Expense:** Select the specific account (e.g., bus, Metro, train, flight) under which the travel expense was incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Amount:** Enter the monetary value of the expense, for example, $100 for a train ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Dynamic Updates and Summary Views

One of the key features of this [[overview_of_notion_expense_tracker | Notion Expense Tracker]] is the [[dynamic_updating_of_expenses_in_notion | dynamic updating of expenses]]. All changes made to expense entries or budgeted amounts are immediately reflected in the summary sections.

*   **Expenses Summary:** This view shows the total expenses incurred for each category, the budgeted amount set, and the percentage spent against the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   Expenses exceeding the budget are indicated in red, for instance, a flight costing $2,000 against a $1,000 budget would show 200% spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Expenses within budget are shown in green, such as $100 spent on breakfast against a $300 budget (33% spent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   If a budgeted expense is not set for an account, the percentage will not reflect an ideal value until it is configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Overall Summary Section:** This section provides a complete overview, displaying the total budgeted expense, total incurred expense, and the difference between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. A percentage indicates the total expenses relative to the budgeted expenses (e.g., $3,600 incurred against $6,100 budgeted results in 59% spent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

By utilizing these features, users can get a quick glance at their spending, allowing for effective [[budgeting_and_expense_management_in_notion | budgeting and expense management]] and planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, and effectively [[customizing_notion_expense_tracker | customize this whole template]].

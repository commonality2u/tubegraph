This article details the functionality of a [[payments_tracker | subscription expenses tracker]] designed to help users [[handling_subscriptions_and_bill_payments | track all their subscription expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## [[features_of_the_payment_tracker_template | Features of the Subscription Expenses Tracker]]

### Subscription Overview

The tracker includes a "Subscription Overview" section that provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

*   **Categories**: Subscriptions are divided into "active" and "canceled" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Details**: Under each category, users can find the name of the subscription, the total expenses incurred for it, and its billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The billing period can be changed by selecting from available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Expenses Section

This section further divides expenses based on the type of subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

*   **Categorization and Breakdown**: Examples of classifications include infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Users can add new expense groups or edit existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Within each classification, the name of the subscription, total expenses, and its percentage contribution to total subscription expenses are shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Adding/Editing Subscriptions**: A quick action button allows users to add a new subscription, which initially appears under a "note subscription" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. These can then be moved to the desired classification, such as "active mode," and their details can be edited using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Transaction Section

This is the primary area for [[tracking_transactions_and_invoice_statuses | feeding details to book subscription expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   **Views**: It offers views for "active subscriptions" and "canceled subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the most recent months appearing at the top, showing the total sum of expenses incurred for each particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Recording Payments**:
    *   **Status**: A checkbox indicates if a subscription is currently active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   **Subscription Account**: Users can select the subscription account, which pulls from the list of subscriptions added in the top section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   **Billing Period**: This value is automatically pulled from the setting defined in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   **Payment Date**: A date picker allows users to choose the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: Users input the subscription expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   **Renewal Date**: The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the set billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, a Netflix subscription paid on September 30 with a monthly billing period would have a renewal date of October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The tracker supports various frequencies like annual and weekly subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Managing Subscription Status**: To cancel a subscription, users can simply click a checkbox, which automatically updates its status to "canceled" and reflects this in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. A quick "add subscription" button in this section also allows for rapid entry of new subscriptions and their details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Customization

The tracker also includes a tutorial on how to change the currency displayed in the dashboard, allowing users to select different currencies as per their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

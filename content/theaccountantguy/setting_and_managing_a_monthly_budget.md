A personal finance tracker developed in a Google Sheet offers a structured approach to [[budgeting_and_savings_strategies | managing your finances]], particularly for [[monthly_budget_management_and_updates | setting and managing monthly budgets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This tool is designed to help individuals track their income and expenses, although it can also be adapted for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Monthly Budget Tab Overview

The core of [[setting_and_managing_budgets_in_notion | budget management]] within this tracker lies in the "Monthly Budget" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This section allows users to set a [[income_and_expense_tracking_with_budget_targets | budget target]] for all expenses and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

The tab is divided into:
*   **Expenses Overview** on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   **Income Overview** on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   **Transactions Area** on the right side for data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

### Setting Expenses and Income

All highlighted areas in the monthly budget tab are auto-computed based on entries made in the transactions area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

1.  **Inputting Expenses**: To start, you set your expenses as they are incurred each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. You can specify details like gas, Wi-Fi, and phone bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Dates can be selected for each expense entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
2.  **Setting Budgeted Amounts**: For each expense category, you can set a budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   The tracker then shows the actual expenses incurred, the difference between the budgeted and actual amounts, and whether you are "under budget" or "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   For example, if a phone bill is budgeted at $1,400, and an entry of $1,300 is made, it will reflect "under budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If an entry of $1,500 is made, it will show "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
3.  **Income Section**: The income section operates on similar principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. You can set targeted income amounts for respective months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, and as you make entries in the transaction area, the actual income will update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Transaction Entry and Tracking

The transaction side includes columns for:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   Details of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
*   A drop-down menu to select income or expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>

### Dynamic Overview and Reporting

The left side of the monthly budget tab provides a [[managing_budget_and_expenditure_overview | dynamic overview]] of expenses and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>:
*   It displays the total budgeted amount, total actual expenses, and the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   A graphical presentation shows how expenses are tracking, with a left bar for budgeted amounts and a right bar for actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Changes in expense entries will update the graph in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   Similarly, an income overview shows the total targeted income, actual income achieved, and the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It also provides a graph comparing targeted vs. actual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This monthly budget tab helps to [[classifying_and_managing_income_and_expenses | classify and manage]] all expenses (bills, subscriptions, etc.) and income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Integrated Reporting

The reporting section allows for dynamic presentation of financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Users can select desired categories like income or expenses from a drop-down menu and choose a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The report will automatically update to reflect the totals and a pie chart showing the division of income or expenses for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for analyzing finances at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

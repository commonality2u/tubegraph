The [[overview_of_employee_training_expenses_tracker | Employee Training Expenses Tracker]] offers a comprehensive dashboard with two primary views: Training Overview and Employee Records, designed for efficient [[customizing_training_and_employee_records | customizing training and employee records]] and attendance.

*   **Employee Count** The number of employees expected to attend the training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Training Expense** The cost associated with each training session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
All information presented in this overview is editable and customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Employee Records
This view lists employees organized by their respective departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Department Management**
    *   Departments can be edited directly by clicking on the department name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   New departments can be added using a slider and a "plus" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

    *   Each employee's record shows the total number of trainings they have attended out of their assigned trainings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For instance, "Steve has attended two out of three trainings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

    *   Users can specify the **Next Training Date** for an employee, and the system automatically calculates the number of days remaining until that date from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Employee Details

*   **Editing Employee Details** Employee names and other details can be edited directly by clicking the edit button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Training Records
This section is used to manage specific training sessions and employee attendance:

This article demonstrates how to utilize a debt payment tracker to manage and pay off debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The system provides a comprehensive [[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | debt overview]] and detailed transaction tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Debt Overview Section

The [[debt_overview_and_loan_categories | debt overview]] section categorizes debts into various payment frequencies, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Key details displayed for each loan include:
*   **Debt Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **EMI Amount**: The installment amount paid for each payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: User-specified interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Initial Repayment**: The first installment payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A calculated date indicating when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs**: Total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Managing Loan Categories and Payment Frequencies

You can add new payment frequency categories, such as "weekly," by clicking the "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The system automatically inserts the new repayment schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Existing repayment schedules, like quarterly and weekly, are also accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. You can move any debt to a different repayment schedule by dragging and dropping its line item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Moving a debt automatically updates its repayment schedule and related calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Adding New Debts

To quickly add a new debt, click the "added details" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This adds the new debt to a "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. You can then select it and move it to the appropriate payment frequency column, allowing you to add all necessary details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Editing Existing Loan Details

To edit existing loan details, click on the relevant debt field and type in your changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Any updates made will automatically reflect across all linked columns and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Tracking and Managing Transactions

The transaction section allows you to view all debt payments made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Paid and Unpaid Installments

Payments are bifurcated by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. A quick summation of all EMIs paid for a particular month is also provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

You can mark an amount as "paid" or "unpaid" by ticking or unticking a checkbox in the first column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. When an installment is marked as paid, it automatically updates in the "paid installment" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Entering Payment Details

For each payment, you can input the following:
*   **Payment Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   **Loan Details**: Select the specific loan from a list of previously added loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

The system automatically calculates the next repayment schedule based on the loan's set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, if a student loan is set for monthly payments, a payment on September 30 will result in a next payment due on October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Similarly, an annual home loan paid on September 27, 2023, will show the next repayment in 2024 on the same date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Adding New Debt Payments

Clicking the "pay debt amount" button automatically adds a new debt payment entry to the schedule with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. You can then fill in the details and description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress

All changes and additions to loan details and payments automatically update the "debt payoff progress" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This section reflects:
*   **Total Amount Repaid**: Calculated from the installments entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage**: The percentage of total debt paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By Date**: A quick reference to the estimated debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Interest Amount Paid**: Total interest paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Principal Amount Repaid**: Total principal paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Any changes to payment amounts, such as altering a student loan payment from $2000 to $3000, immediately update the total amount repaid and all related calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

A business [[using_notion_as_an_expense_tracker | expense tracker]] in Notion is designed to help keep [[benefits_of_tracking_expenses_in_notion | track of all business expenses]] under one general ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system allows for the definition of expense categories, setting of budgets, and detailed [[budget_and_actual_expense_tracking_in_notion | budget and actual expense tracking]] through an expenses overview.

## Expense Categories and Budgeting

The tracker begins with an "Expense Categories" section where users can define different types of business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

*   **Predefined Heads**: The template includes some predefined business expense categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Modification**:
    *   To modify or change a main category, click on it and then "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
    *   To change a subcategory, click the pencil icon to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: Users can add a new category by clicking "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Setting Budgeted Amounts**: For each category, a budgeted amount of expense can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This set amount will automatically reflect in the tracker's overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Expenses Overview

The "Expenses Overview" section provides a summary of financial performance against set budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

*   **Displayed Metrics**:
    *   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
    *   Budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
    *   A percentage indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or if spending is within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Automatic Updates**: Any changes to the budgeted amount in the expense categories will automatically update the "Expenses Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. For example, changing an advertising budget from $100 to $5,000 will reflect immediately in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Transaction Entry

Individual expenses are entered in the "Transaction" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

*   **Entering Details**:
    *   Click to choose the date, which auto-populates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
    *   Input a description of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   Select an account from previously defined accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   Enter the expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Summary

On the left side of the tracker, a summary view is available, providing key financial figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This summary includes:

*   Budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>

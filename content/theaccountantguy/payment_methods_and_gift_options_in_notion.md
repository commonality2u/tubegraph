The Product Order Tracker is a Notion template designed to help businesses keep track of customer orders [00:00:03]. This template allows for the detailed management of product orders, customer information, payment sources, and gift item tracking [00:00:05].

## Product Order Tracker Overview

The core of the template is a database that captures various aspects of each order [00:00:10]. It includes:
*   **Product Details**: Such as the product name [00:00:12].
*   **Customer Information**: Including the customer's name, billing address, phone number, and email [00:00:15].
*   **Order Amount**: The total amount for the particular order placed by the customer [00:00:31].

At the top of the template, an order summary provides key metrics, including the total order value, the number of orders placed, and the number of customers who have placed an order [00:00:34].

## Payment Sources

The template allows for tracking of customer payment methods [00:00:22]. The database specifies how customers intend to pay [00:00:24].

In the order summary, there's a section dedicated to payment sources, indicating the distribution of how customers are paying [00:01:01]. Common payment methods reflected include:
*   Debit card [00:01:06]
*   PayPal [00:01:07]
*   Credit card [00:01:08]
*   Other sources [00:01:08]

Each payment source shows the number of customers using it and its respective percentage of the total [00:01:10].

## Gift Item Tracking

The template also tracks whether a customer intends for a product to be sent as a gift item [00:00:27].

The order summary includes a "gift recommendation percentage," which indicates how many customers are looking to place an order as a gift item [00:00:44]. For example, a 67% figure would mean that percentage of customers are seeking to send items as gifts [00:00:54]. This percentage dynamically changes based on updates to the individual order entries [00:00:57].

## Customization and Expansion

This Notion template is fully customizable to suit specific business needs [00:01:16]. Users can add additional metrics like average order value or other required Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) [00:01:19]. The underlying database can also be expanded to include more items or details as needed for tracking product-related orders [00:01:30].

Sanat Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guy, is a chartered accountant from India who helps individuals, freelancers, and small business owners manage their finances using Notion. He has developed various templates, including a [[how_to_track_net_worth_using_notion | Net Worth Tracker]] designed to help users track their net worth within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Overview of the Net Worth Tracker

The Notion Net Worth Tracker is structured into three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:

1.  **Get Started**: This section is where users specify their [[net_worth_goal_and_progress_tracking | net worth goal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  **Account**: Here, users can classify and manage all their accounts, including expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For more information, see [[managing_accounts_for_personal_finances_in_notion | Managing Accounts for Personal Finances in Notion]].
3.  **Summary**: This section provides an overview of entire finances, displaying closing balances and proportions of each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It also includes a dedicated net worth section that shows the overall calculation and progress towards the set goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
4.  **Transactions View**: Users can input all income, expenses, and details related to assets and liabilities, which feeds into the net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For more details, see [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_Notion | Tracking Income and Expenses in Notion]].

## Setting Your Net Worth Goal

To begin tracking your net worth, the first step is to define your goal within the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Steps to Set the Goal

1.  Navigate to the "Get Started" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  Locate the "Net Worth Goal" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
3.  Click on the displayed amount (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
4.  Edit the value to your desired net worth goal (e.g., $14,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

As soon as the new value is entered, the entire database automatically updates to reflect this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This goal is entirely customizable and can be edited at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Tracking Progress Towards Your Goal

The "Net Worth View" within the Summary section provides key statistics to track your progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>:

*   **Net Worth Goal**: This displays the target you set (e.g., $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: This is calculated as the difference between your total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Difference**: Shows the remaining amount needed to reach your net worth goal (Net Worth Goal - Total Net Worth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Total Growth**: Represents the increase in your net worth (Closing Net Worth - Opening Net Worth), where opening net worth is derived from opening balances of assets and liabilities specified in the account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Indicates how much of your net worth goal has been accomplished (Total Net Worth / Net Worth Goal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

As you continue to add transactions and manage accounts, your net worth figures will automatically update, providing a real-time assessment of your financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

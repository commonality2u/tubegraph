This article explains how to track and analyze business expenses related to [[home_renovation_expense_tracking | construction projects]] using a Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Construction Expense Tracking Template

The Notion template provides a structured way to manage [[expense_summary_and_analysis | expenses]] for construction projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It defines different categories of expenses at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each category, it displays both the budgeted expense amount and the actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Values in this table can be modified, and the expense totals will update dynamically to reflect the changes corresponding to their categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

> [!INFO] Dynamic Updates
> Changing values in the expense table dynamically updates the actual expenses displayed for each category at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Managing Expense Categories

The template allows for flexible management of expense categories:
*   **Editing Categories:** Click on a pencil icon next to a category to define a new category for a specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Adding Categories:** Click on "new page" to add a new expense category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories:** Click on the three-dot menu next to a category and select "delete" to remove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Setting Budgeted Expenses

For budgeted expenses, users can simply click on the budgeted amount field to define a new budgeted expense amount for their requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Expense Summary and Analysis

A dedicated summary section provides an [[understanding_the_expenses_overview | overview]] of the project's financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This section includes:
*   The total budgeted expense that was initially defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   The total actual expenses, pulled from the expense table at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The difference between the total budgeted and actual expenses, enabling [[comparing_actual_vs_budgeted_expenses_and_calculating_differences | comparison]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The percentage of actual expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

This template offers a quick and easy way to keep track of [[budgeted_vs_actual_expenses_in_construction_projects | construction project expenses]] in one Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

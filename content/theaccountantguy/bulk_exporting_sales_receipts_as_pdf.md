The `PDF output.com` tool provides functionality to [[generating_sales_receipts_pdf_documents | generate sales receipts PDF documents]] and [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents_in_bulk | export PDF documents in bulk]] for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Accessing the Tool
To utilize this tool, navigate to `PDF output.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Upon arrival, a "template selection" dropdown is available at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. From this dropdown, select the "Sales Receipts" template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Bulk Export Mode
The platform offers a "bulk export mode document" for [[bulk_exporting_pdf_documents_from_databases | bulk exporting PDF documents from databases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. In this mode, users input sales receipt information into a database-like structure within the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Data Entry and Management
Users can input sales receipt details into the provided database interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The columns for `receipt number`, `receipt date`, `payment method`, business name, address, item descriptions, quantities, and unit prices are available, mirroring a sales receipts tracker template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

*   **Customization**: The width of columns and row heights can be adjusted for better readability and data entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Adding/Deleting Rows**: New rows can be added to include more sales receipt data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, and existing rows can be deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Currency Selection
The currency for the receipts can be selected, with US Dollars as the default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Changing the currency automatically updates the currency display on the generated PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, including during bulk exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Downloading PDFs
Once all information is entered, there are two primary ways to [[exporting_and_downloading_pdf_documents | export and download PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>:

1.  **Download All PDFs**: Clicking the "Download all PDF" button initiates the download of all sales receipts as individual PDF files in one go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The system downloads all generated PDFs successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
2.  **Download Individual PDFs**: Users can click on a specific row to download only the PDF for that particular sales receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

This process enables efficient [[exporting_and_downloading_generated_pdf_documents | exporting and downloading generated PDF documents]] for various business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

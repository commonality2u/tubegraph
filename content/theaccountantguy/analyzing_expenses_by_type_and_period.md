A bills tracker in Notion can help manage and analyze expenses effectively by categorizing them by type and period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This system allows for a comprehensive overview of financial commitments and payment statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Expense Classification

Expenses are classified in the bills tracker using several key attributes:

### By Priority
Bills can be assigned a priority level: low, medium, or high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This classification helps in understanding the distribution of bills based on their importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. For each priority, the total expense incurred and the percentage of bills paid can be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### By Category
Bills are categorized into six distinct types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>:
*   Entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   Food and Groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   Utility Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Travel and Transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Loans and Debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>

For each category, the total amount paid and the percentage of bills paid are shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This allows for [[expense_categorization_and_analysis | analysis of spending habits]] across different areas.

## Expense Distribution by Period

Expenses are also distributed and tracked based on their frequency or period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>:
*   Daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
*   Weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   Monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   Quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   Half-yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   Annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   One-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

For each period, the tracker displays several key financial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>:
*   [[tracking_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | Budgeted expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, which is rolled up from the bills database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, also rolled up from the bills database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   The change observed (budgeted expense less actual expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   The upcoming bill to be paid, showing the earliest due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   The number of bills paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, determined by specifying a "checked" condition in the roll-up values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   Bills paid in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, calculated as bills paid divided by total bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

This detailed [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | overview of expenses]] by period facilitates [[managing_different_types_of_business_expenses | managing different types of expenses]] and [[calculating_expense_differences_and_budget_percentages | tracking budget adherence]] more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

This guide outlines how to utilize a monthly budget planner in [[Notion | Notion]] to manage personal finances, as presented by An Biswal, "The Accountant Guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The planner helps you start budgeting for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Overview of the Planner

The monthly budget planner features four main views at the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

1.  **Expenses Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>:
    *   Displays common expense categories like Shopping, Entertainment, Food Expenses, and Utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
    *   For each expense, it shows the total expense amount, budgeted amount, the percentage of the total budgeted amount incurred, and a status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  **Monthly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:
    *   Presents all discussed expenses in a monthly format, categorized by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
3.  **Yearly Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
    *   Provides the exact same information as the monthly overview but presented in a yearly format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
4.  **Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>:
    *   Offers a complete expense overlook in a yearly format, where all expenses are grouped to provide an overview of your financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

All information for the budget planner is entered into the "expense details database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Expenses are categorized by month and sorted in descending order, with later months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

To enter a new transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>:

1.  Click "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Enter the **Date** (e.g., February 1, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The month automatically adjusts if the date is changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Enter the **Expense Detail** (e.g., Wi-Fi expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Select the **Period** (e.g., Feb 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. You can add new periods if they are not displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  Select the **Year** (e.g., 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
6.  Select the **Category** (e.g., Utilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. You can add your own categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
7.  Set the **Expense Code**, which segregates expenses by category and month (e.g., Utility Feb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
8.  Enter the **Expense Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This column is for booking specific expenses as they are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The "Budget Amount" column is used separately for setting budgets at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Setting a Budget

At the start of each month, you can set a budget for specific expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

To set a budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>:

1.  Select the **Date** (e.g., February 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  Enter the **Expense Name** for which you are setting the budget (e.g., Food) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  Select the **Period** (e.g., February) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Select the **Year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
5.  Select the **Category** (e.g., Food) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. When setting a budget, the expense name and category name should generally be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
6.  Set the **Expense Code** (e.g., Food Feb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
7.  Enter the budget amount in the **Budget Column** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once entered, all figures in the overview sections will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Analyzing Your Finances

After booking all expenses, you can extract insights from the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>:

*   **By Period**: Clicking on a period (e.g., Feb 2024) reveals a new window showing all transactions booked for that period, detailing amounts and whether they were budget or expense entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **By Year**: Clicking on the year provides a similar view, showing budgeted amounts, expense amounts, expenses as a percentage, budget status, and all transactions for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **By Category**: You can see how much expense has been booked for a particular category, including budgeted amounts, expense amounts, and status. It also lists all category-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **By Expense Code**: This allows you to see how much has been booked for a specific category within a particular month compared to its budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

By continually adding expense information, the overviews at the top will automatically update, providing real-time insights into your month's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

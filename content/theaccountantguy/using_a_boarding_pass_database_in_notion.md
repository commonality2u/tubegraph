Notion can be utilized to generate boarding pass PDF documents directly from a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This process involves connecting a specific database containing boarding pass details with a corresponding template to produce PDF outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Components

To generate boarding pass PDFs, two main components are required in Notion:

*   **Boarding Pass Database** This [[creating_a_database_in_notion | database]] holds all the specific details for each boarding pass, such as passenger name, flight information, and other relevant data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **Boarding Pass Template** This template is designed to structure the information pulled from the [[creating_a_database_in_notion | database]] into a presentable boarding pass format for PDF generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Process

The steps to generate PDF boarding passes using Notion are as follows:

1.  **Identify PDF Output Connection:** Specify "boarding pass" as the name for the PDF output connection details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  **Connect Database:** Type "boarding pass [[creating_a_database_in_notion | database]]" to link the relevant Notion [[creating_a_database_in_notion | database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
3.  **Select Template:** Choose the "boarding pass template" from the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
4.  **Load Information:** Click "next" to initiate the loading of all information from both the [[creating_a_database_in_notion | database]] and the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
5.  **Export Documents:** Once all data is loaded, click "export" to begin generating the PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Output and Usage

Upon successful export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:

*   You can preview a sample of the generated boarding pass, confirming it includes all details from the [[creating_a_database_in_notion | database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   The generated PDF files can then be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   After downloading and extracting, the individual PDF documents can be opened and utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Multiple boarding passes, each with different names and contexts, can be generated through this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

A debt payment tracker tool can be utilized to pay off all debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool helps in [[debt_payment_tracking_and_reporting | tracking debt payment]] progress and details.

## Debt Overview Section

The debt overview section categorizes debt into different payment frequencies, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Key details tracked for each debt include:
*   **Debt Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **EMI Amount**: The amount paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This contributes to [[tracking_payment_amounts_and_due_payments | tracking payment amounts]] and due payments.
*   **Interest Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Initial Repayment**: The first installment payment date for the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A calculated date indicating when the debt will be fully repaid if payments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs**: The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Users can add new debt categories, such as "weekly" repayment schedules, which automatically insert into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Existing debts can be moved between different repayment schedules (e.g., quarterly, weekly), and the repayment schedule and other calculations automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

To quickly add a new debt, a dedicated button allows adding details to a "no payment frequency" column, which can then be assigned to a specific frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Existing loan details can be edited by clicking on the debt field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress

The debt payoff progress section provides an overview of all loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This section integrates with the installment payments to show:
*   **Total Amount Repaid**: This figure updates automatically as EMIs for any loan are paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Net Payoff in Percentage**: Shows the percentage of the total debt that has been paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A quick reference to the calculated debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Interest Amount Paid**: The total interest paid so far within the total repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Principal Amount Repaid**: The principal portion of the total repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Every amount paid towards debt repayment is split into interest and principal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

All these details update automatically as payment details are added or modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This provides a comprehensive overview of [[tracking_debt_repayment_and_interest_in_notion | debt repayment and interest tracking]].

## Transaction Section (Installments)

The transaction section allows users to track all debt payments made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This includes:

### Paid Installment Section
This section reflects all paid debts, bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It provides a quick summation of all EMIs paid for a particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This is useful for [[tracking_bill_payments_and_due_dates | tracking bill payments and due dates]].

For each installment, the following [[payment_details_and_tracking_methods | payment details and tracking methods]] are available:
*   **Paid Status**: A checkbox to mark if the amount has been paid. Ticking or unticking this updates the status in the paid/unpaid columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Payment Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   **Loan Details**: Allows selecting a specific loan that was added earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
*   **Next Repayment Schedule**: Automatically calculated based on the set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, a student loan set for monthly payments will show the next payment one month from the current payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. A [[tracking_home_renovation_expenses | home loan]] set for annual repayment will show the next payment date a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

A "pay debt amount" button automatically adds a new debt payment to the schedule based on the current date, allowing users to input details and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Changes made in this section, such as modifying an EMI amount, are automatically reflected in the "Debt Payoff Progress" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This allows for [[tracking_transactions_and_progress_towards_savings_goals | tracking transactions]] and progress towards financial goals.

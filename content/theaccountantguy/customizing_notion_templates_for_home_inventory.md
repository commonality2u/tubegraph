The [[home_inventory_tracking_using_notion | Home Inventory Tracker]] is a straightforward Notion template designed to centralize and manage all household inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It provides an overview of purchases, consumption, and available units, helping users monitor their stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template is divided into several key sections:

### Financial Tracking (Left Side)
This section displays financial aspects related to inventory, including:
*   Total estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   The difference between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   The percentage of actual purchases compared to estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

### Inventory Management Sections (Right Side)
The right side of the dashboard is structured into three main areas:

#### Inventory Categories
This section allows users to set up different categories for their inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples provided include "Dairies and Eggs," "Medicines," and "Fruits and Veggies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Each category lists its subcategories and the estimated budgeted purchase for those items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This acts as a [[template_for_categorizing_home_inventory | template for categorizing home inventory]].

#### Inventory Overview
The Inventory Overview provides a summary of the inventory status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   Total purchases made for each subcategory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Percentage of total units consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
This overview is applicable to all listed subcategories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

#### Transaction Section
This area is used to record specific inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Users can specify purchased items, like "cheese," along with the amount purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It also allows recording when items are consumed, by specifying the number of items used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. All transaction entries automatically update the other sections of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, making it a valuable tool for [[using_notion_for_inventory_management | inventory management]].

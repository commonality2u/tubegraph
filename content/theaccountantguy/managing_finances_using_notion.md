He offers a variety of [[finance_templates_in_notion | Notion templates]] for financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, including a dedicated [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | net worth tracker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Notion Net Worth Tracker Overview
The net worth tracker is structured into three main sections:
*   **Get Started Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>: Used to specify your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Account Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>: Where you list all your different accounts, categorized as expenses, income, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:
    *   Provides an overview of all finances, showing closing balances and proportions of each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   Includes a net worth section that calculates total net worth, the difference from your goal, total growth, and the percentage of your goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Transactions View** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>: This is where you input all income, expenses, and details related to assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Setting Up Accounts
Begin by setting your net worth goal in the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Changing this value automatically updates the entire database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

In the "Account" section, default accounts are pre-added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, but you can add new accounts under specific categories (Income, Expense, Asset, Liability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

When adding an account, such as "Interest Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>:
*   **Opening Balance**: Applicable for assets and liabilities, not for income or expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Assign a tag to the account (e.g., groceries under "Bills," Netflix under "Subscription") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. You can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: Specify how often the payment or receipt occurs (e.g., monthly for salary, quarterly for interest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Custom frequencies can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Opening Units**: Used for investments, left blank for income or expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Asset Class**: Only for investments (e.g., "Bitcoin" classified as "Investments") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

Accounts are fully customizable and editable at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Entering Transactions
The "Transactions" section has four main views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, plus an "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Transactions are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

To enter a transaction:
1.  Click "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
2.  Select the **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> (automatically classifies by month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
3.  Add a **Description** (e.g., "Salary income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
4.  The **Category** is automatically set based on the view (e.g., "Income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
5.  Select the relevant **Account** (e.g., "Salary account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
6.  Choose the **Payment Mode** (e.g., "Bank account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
7.  Set the **Transaction Type**:
    *   **Inflow**: For income or increasing liabilities (e.g., receiving salary, taking a loan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   **Outflow**: For expenses, reducing assets, or repaying liabilities (e.g., paying bills, buying an asset, loan repayment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
8.  Specify the **Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
9.  Optionally, attach a **Document** (receipt or bill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Tracking Net Worth in the Summary Section
After inputting transactions and accounts, the "Summary" section calculates your net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

#### Finances View
This view shows current amounts for all expenses, income, assets, and liabilities, along with their proportion to the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

#### Net Worth View
This view provides five key statistical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>:
1.  **Net Worth Goal**: Your predefined goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
2.  **Total Net Worth**: The difference between your total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
3.  **Difference**: The gap between your net worth goal and your total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
4.  **Total Growth**: The difference between your closing net worth and your opening net worth (based on opening balances of assets and liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
5.  **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: Shows how much of your net worth goal has been accomplished (Total Net Worth / Net Worth Goal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

As transactions are added, your net worth automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

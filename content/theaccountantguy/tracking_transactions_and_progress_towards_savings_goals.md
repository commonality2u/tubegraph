The savings funds tracker provides a comprehensive dashboard to [[monitoring_savings_progress_and_goals | monitor savings progress]] and manage financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tool is designed to help users [[tracking_savings_and_contributions_for_sinking_funds | track savings and contributions for sinking funds]] and understand their financial standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Savings Funds Dashboard

The dashboard features two primary views: the Savings Target and the Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Savings Target View

This section allows users to set and manage specific saving funds and their corresponding target amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

*   **Editing Existing Funds**: To modify a pre-added saving fund, click the pencil icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Users can rename the fund, such as changing "Saving Fund One" to "Car Fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The goal amount can also be adjusted, for example, from $2,500 to $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Any changes made here are automatically updated in the Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Adding New Funds**: A new savings fund can be added by clicking the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A default fund will appear, which can then be named (e.g., "New Saving Fund") and assigned a custom goal amount, such as $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Deleting Funds**: To remove a saving fund, click the six dots on its left side and select the "Delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Savings Overview View

The Savings Overview provides a summary of the total savings accumulated, the targeted savings amount, and the percentage of the target achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This view dynamically updates as new transactions are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Adding and Tracking Transactions

The "Transactions Panel" at the bottom of the tracker is used for [[adding_transactions_and_expenses | adding transactions]] that contribute to savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

*   **Adding Transactions**: Click the "Add Transaction" button to create a new entry with the current system date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Transactions are grouped by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Users can also select a different date from a calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Entering Details**: For each transaction, users can enter a description (e.g., "saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Linking to Funds**: Select the specific saving fund (e.g., "Car Fund") from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Saving Amount**: Input the amount saved for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The system automatically updates the total savings for that fund in the Savings Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. For example, if $1,000 is added to a Car Fund that previously had $1,400, the total will update to $2,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The percentage of the target amount achieved will also update dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Customization Options

The savings funds tracker offers several customization features:

*   **Currency Settings**: The currency for any amount can be changed. By clicking on a dollar amount and selecting "edit property," users can access a "number format" option that supports various currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Assistance with setting up the template in a different currency is available post-purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Views**: The transaction view is entirely dynamic and can be grouped by different timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
    *   **Monthly View**: Transactions are grouped by month by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
    *   **Weekly or Yearly View**: Users can change the grouping to display transactions on a weekly or yearly basis by clicking the three dots next to the grouping option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This provides [[using_dynamic_views_for_monthly_and_yearly_savings_tracking | dynamic views for monthly and yearly savings tracking]] progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

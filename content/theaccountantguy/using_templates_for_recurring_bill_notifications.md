This guide demonstrates how to [[setting_up_bill_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | set up bill payment reminders on WhatsApp]] using templates to manage recurring bills automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system allows you to receive notifications for due payments, such as Wi-Fi or mobile bills, showing the due date and payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Creating a New Bill Payment Reminder

To create a new bill payment reminder:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the name of the bill, for example, "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
4.  Specify the bill amount, such as $1500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
5.  Click "back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Setting Up Recurring Notifications

Once a new bill template is created, you can [[creating_and_managing_recurring_bills | set the bill to repeat on a recurring basis]]:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots next to the newly created bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Choose the frequency, for instance, "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time and day of the month when you wish to receive the notification (e.g., 11:55 AM on the 20th of every month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once saved, the system will automatically send notifications on the specified recurring schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

To enable these automated WhatsApp notifications, the system utilizes an automation tool like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The entire automation setup within Pabbly Connect is designed to ensure notifications are sent reliably, and a detailed explanation and guide are provided when the template is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Receiving Notifications

After the automation is set up and a template is configured for [[customizing_recurring_payment_notifications | recurring notifications]], you will automatically begin receiving reminders on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For example, if a bill is set to notify at 11:55 AM on the 20th, a new bill item will be added, and the WhatsApp notification will typically arrive within a minute, ensuring you are reminded promptly for every added bill each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

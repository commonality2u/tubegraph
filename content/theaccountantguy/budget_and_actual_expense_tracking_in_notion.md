A [[using_notion_as_an_expense_tracker | Notion expenses tracker]] template is available to help manage all your expenses in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This template is highly customizable and can be used for any purpose, including [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | personal]] or business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## Key Features

The template features a category section at the top, initially containing three categories that can be defined according to individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Category Management
*   **Renaming Categories**: Hover over a category to reveal a pencil icon, which allows you to rename it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. After renaming, press Enter to save the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Editing/Deleting Categories**: Click on the three dots next to a category to access options for editing or deleting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: A new category can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

### Expense Tracking
Each category in the tracker displays both a "budgeted expense amount" and an "actual expense amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   **Entering Expenses**: As you enter expense amounts, the categories are automatically updated with the respective expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Setting Budgeted Expenses**: The budgeted expense amount for each category can be customized by clicking on it and setting your desired figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. For example, the total budget can be set to $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Summary Section
The summary section provides a comprehensive overview of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. It includes:
*   **Budgeted Expense Amount**: The total amount planned for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Actual Expenses Amount**: This figure is computed from the expenses entered in the table below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The variance between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Budget Spent**: The proportion of the budget that has been utilized so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

The summary section automatically updates to reflect the changes in budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This [[budget_vs_actual_expense_tracking | budget vs actual expense tracking]] functionality helps in effective [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

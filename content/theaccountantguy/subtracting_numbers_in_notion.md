This article explains how to [[using_formulas_to_calculate_differences_in_notion | find the difference]] between two numbers in Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Two distinct [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] can be used for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Methods for Subtracting Numbers

There are two primary methods to subtract numbers in Notion:

1.  **Using the Subtract Operator**
    The `subtract` operator is one way to [[using_formulas_to_calculate_differences_in_notion | find the difference]] between two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This operator takes two numbers as input and calculates their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, providing "number one" and "number two" as inputs will yield their difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

2.  **Using the Minus Sign**
    The minus sign (`-`) can also be used to [[using_formulas_to_calculate_differences_in_notion | find the difference]] between two numbers in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, similar to how the [[using_the_subtract_operator_in_notion | subtract operator]] functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Steps to Subtract Numbers in Notion

To perform subtraction in Notion, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a Database**
    Begin by creating a database. This can be done by typing `/database` and selecting from the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
2.  **Define Title Property**
    The first property of the database should be a title property, which describes the operation being performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  **Assign Number Properties**
    Next, [[assigning_properties_to_numbers_in_notion | assign the "Number" property]] to two different numbers within the database rows. These will be the numbers between which you want to find the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  **Apply a Formula Property**
    Finally, add a new property with the "Formula" type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. In this formula property, you can use either the [[using_the_subtract_operator_in_notion | `subtract` operator]] or the `minus sign` to calculate the difference between your two number properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The Personal Finance Tracker, developed in a Google Sheet, includes a dedicated tab for [[debt_and_liability_tracking | Debt Payment Report]] to help users understand their financial liabilities and track progress towards payoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This tool is designed to manage and analyze debt payments effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Overview of Debt Tracking Capabilities

The [[debt_and_liability_tracking | Debt Payment Report]] allows users to view:
*   The total debts incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   The total interest and principal paid to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   The outstanding loan balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

This tab is considered a crucial part of the tracker due to its comprehensive [[tracking_debt_payments_and_budgets | debt management]] features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Inputting Debt Information

To use the [[debt_payment_tracking_using_notion | debt payment tracking]] feature, users need to provide specific information for each debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>:
*   **Debt Information** Details about the specific debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Loan Amount** The total loan amount taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate** The applicable interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Minimum EMI Payment** The minimum monthly installment (EMI) required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Additional Down Payment** Any extra down payment made at the time of obtaining the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Initial Repayment Date** The first date a repayment was made towards the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Once this initial data is entered, the tracker automatically calculates the loan outstanding at the beginning of the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> and other relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Tracking Payments

Users can make entries for their debt payments on the right side of the [[payments_tracker | Debt Payment]] tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. For each payment, they need to:
*   Specify the date of the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   Choose the specific debt from a dropdown list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   Enter the EMI amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

The tracker then automatically computes the interest value, principal value, and updates the loan outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. As subsequent installments are paid, the loan outstanding continues to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

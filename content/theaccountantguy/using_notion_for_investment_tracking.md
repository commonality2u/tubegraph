This Notion-based Investment Portfolio tracker allows users to manage and track all their investments, providing a clear overview of holdings and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is designed to track various asset classes, including stocks and cryptocurrencies, with the flexibility to add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Investment Section

The "Investment" section is where users initially set up their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For each investment, users must input the opening balance and opening units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Examples include pre-added stocks and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Portfolio Section

After initial setup, the "Portfolio" section provides a dynamic overview:
*   **Investment Value & Units:** It reflects the investment value and available units after all transactions are carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Investment Percentage:** Indicates the proportion of a specific investment relative to the total portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss:** Shows the total profit or loss for each investment, updated after every transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A summary of profit/loss is also provided for each section (e.g., stocks, crypto) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Adding and Managing Investments

New investments can be quickly added using the "Add Investment" quick action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Clicking this button creates a new entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Users then click the pencil icon to open a panel for details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Input the investment name, opening balance (e.g., $100), and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Investments can be categorized under existing groups like "stocks" or "crypto" by moving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   New categories, such as "bonds," can be created using the plus icon, which adds a new section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Existing items can be edited by clicking on them and typing the desired changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Transaction Section

Below the portfolio, the "Transaction" section records all investment activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It offers different views: "All," "Buy," and "Sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### All Transactions View
This view lists both buy and sell transactions. For each transaction, users input:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   Transaction type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Investment account (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
*   Number of units (e.g., 30 units sold, 50 units bought) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   The "Price" is calculated automatically in the buy and sell sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   The "Amount" is automatically calculated as units multiplied by price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Buy and Sell Views
These specialized views help streamline data entry for specific transaction types. When buying or selling, users fill in information such as the date, description, investment account, and units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The "buy price" input automatically calculates the "buy amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Similar calculations apply for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Profit and Loss Section

This section displays the profit or loss generated from each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For sales transactions, it includes the sales value and the corresponding buy price. The difference between the sell price and buy price, multiplied by the units sold, determines the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. For example, selling 30 units of Apple stock at $40 that were bought at $10 yields a profit of $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Quick Action Buttons

The tracker features quick action buttons to streamline data input for transactions:
*   **Buy Investment:** Automatically adds a new entry under the "Buy" view, pre-populating the current date, which can be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Sell Investment:** Similar to the buy button, this adds a new line item under the "Sell" view, allowing users to quickly input sale details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

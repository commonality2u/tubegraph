The customer payments tracker is a simple template designed to help you keep track of all your [[setting_up_a_customer_payments_tracker | customer payments]] in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This template is entirely [[customizing_notion_templates_for_financial_tracking | customizable]] to fit your specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

## Customizing Customer Sections

The template allows for extensive [[customizing_notion_templates_for_financial_tracking | customization]] within its customer database section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The customer section is initially divided into three subsets:
*   Regular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Seasonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Occasional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

You can perform the following [[customizing_notion_templates_for_financial_tracking | customizations]]:

*   **Edit Subsections**
    *   To edit any existing subsection, simply click on it and start editing the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Add Subsections**
    *   To add a new subsection, click the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Edit Customer Names**
    *   To edit a customer's name, click the pencil icon next to their name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Add New Customers**
    *   You can add new customer names within each section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Delete Customers**
    *   To delete a customer, click the three-dot icon next to their name and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

## Adjusting Payment Amounts

Within each customer entry, you can manage the total payment amount due:
*   **Change Due Amount**
    *   To change the total payment amount due for a customer, click on the existing amount and enter the new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Updating Transactions

The transaction section allows you to enter specific payment details which then update the overall payment received summary:
*   **Enter Transaction Details**
    *   You can enter the date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
    *   Add a description for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Select the customer name from a dropdown list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   Enter the payment amount for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Attach Documents**
    *   A document section is available for attaching specific invoices related to the customer's transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Automatic Updates

When you fill in the transaction details, the "payment received" amount automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For example, if you change a transaction value, the received payment amount will reflect that change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

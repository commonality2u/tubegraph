*   **Accounts Section** This is where different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities are specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It includes opening balances, payment frequencies, and categories for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Summary Section** This section provides an at-a-glance view of all finances, including the contribution of each account (income, expenses, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Debt Section** Displays upcoming and past debt payments, including next payment due dates, total debt, and debt paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

*   **Savings Section** Helps track personal savings, including goal amounts and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Bills Section** Shows upcoming and past bill payments, modifiable to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Subscription Section** Similar to the bills and debt sections, it tracks subscription statuses, payment dates, and renewal frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Section** Provides a total overview of net worth achieved and how much is remaining to reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Transaction Section** This is where all transactions related to income, expenses, assets, or liabilities are recorded, affecting all other sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

1.  In the "Finances" summary view, click on any income or expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
2.  A window will open on the right. Scroll down to find and click "View Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. This will display only the transactions associated with that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

A travel expense tracker can be used to [[tracking_expenses_and_budgets_monthly_and_yearly | keep track of all travel expenses]] and plan ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system allows users to compare budgeted amounts with actual incurred expenses.

## Summary Section

The tracker features a summary section that includes views for accounts, expenses, and an overall summary of all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Accounts View: Setting Budgets

Under the accounts view, users can [[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | set up different expenses]] that will be incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Expenses are classified into categories such as "travel," "meals," and "lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

To add a new expense category:
1.  Click "add expense source" to automatically add a new source to a travel category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon to edit the details, such as changing the name to "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
3.  [[setting_and_updating_budgeted_and_actual_expenses_in_notion | Set the budgeted amount]] for this expense source (e.g., $1,500 for Metro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
4.  To move an expense source to a different category (e.g., "meals"), click the three dots and place it under the desired section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
5.  To add an entirely new expense group/category, click the plus sign on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Each expense source has a budgeted amount set for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Expenses View: Comparing Actual to Budget

The expenses view provides a clear comparison by showing:
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Budgeted expense set for that specific expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   Percentage of actual spending against the budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

#### Examples of Comparison:
*   **Flight Expense**: An incurred expense of $2,000 against a budgeted expense of $1,000 results in 200% of the budgeted amount, indicated in red, signifying overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Breakfast Expense**: An incurred expense of $100 against a budget of $300 results in 33% of the budgeted amount, shown in green, indicating spending is within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_against_set_budgets | classification provides a quick overview]] of where expenses stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Overall Summary

The summary section provides an [[overview_of_total_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | overview of total budgeted and actual expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It shows:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The difference between the two amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   A percentage indicating the total expenses divided by the budgeted expense (e.g., 59% meaning 3600 incurred expenses divided by 6800 budgeted expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

This overall summary helps to [[managing_budget_and_actual_expenses | understand the current financial standing]] against the set budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Booking Expenses

To add actual expenses:
1.  Expenses are categorized under "travel," "meals," and "lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
2.  Use quick addition buttons (e.g., "add travel expense") to add a new expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This automatically adds an entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
3.  Add a description and trip information (e.g., "trip to Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
4.  Select the account of the expense, such as "train" for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Enter the amount of the expense (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it reflects in the expenses summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If a budgeted expense for that category (e.g., $200 for train) is set, the system will automatically reflect the actual spend as a percentage of the budget (e.g., 50% incurred) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This system allows for [[monitoring_budget_versus_actual_expenses | continuous monitoring]] and planning of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

This guide demonstrates how to utilize a spreadsheet-based personal finance tracker to manage income and expense details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Spreadsheet Overview
The personal finance tracker spreadsheet is structured with three primary tabs: the Dashboard, Transactions, and Budget tabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Additionally, a "Start Here" tab provides initial instructions for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Budget Tab
The first step in using the tracker is to navigate to the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
Here, users need to:
*   Input details related to income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Specify budgeted amounts for expenses or income goals for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Accounts can be categorized as either income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The "goal amount" column automatically totals the monthly inputs, as it is a formula-driven column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. When adding new line items, this formula needs to be dragged down to new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Users can add new rows to the budget tab by selecting the desired number of rows and clicking "ADD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Transactions Tab
After setting up accounts and budget estimations in the Budget tab, the next step is to add transactions in the Transactions tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

For each transaction, users input the following:
*   Date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Details of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Category related to the transaction, which corresponds to the accounts previously added in the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   An amount for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

A column (column E) in this tab is formula-driven and automatically specifies whether the transaction is an income or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Similar to the Budget tab, this formula needs to be dragged down when new line items are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Dashboard Tab
The Dashboard section provides comprehensive analysis of income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. All analyses can be controlled and filtered by category, specified period, and type of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Key sections of the dashboard include:
*   **Summary** Displays total income, total expense, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. For example, filtering for the entire 2023 period across all accounts will show this summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Income Overview** Specifies different sources of income earned during the selected period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Expenses Overview** Provides a similar breakdown for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Monthly Personal Finance Overview** Shows income and expense details for each month, as well as the net balance for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Status Callout** Indicates whether expenses have been exceeded or not, based on predefined naming conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Users can adjust filters to view specific details, such as the total income for a particular period or income from an individual source like "salary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The entire view on the dashboard updates accordingly with each filter change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

The customer payments tracker template includes a dedicated "customer section" designed to help users [[managing_customer_information_in_notion | set up and manage their customer database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This system allows for organized tracking of all customer payments in one central location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Customer Section Overview

The customer section is strategically divided into three default sub-sections to categorize customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:
*   **Regular** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Seasonal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   **Occasional** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

### Managing Subcategories
Users have the flexibility to customize these sub-sections:
*   **Editing existing sub-sections:** Click on a section to begin editing its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Adding new sub-sections:** Click the plus (+) icon to introduce additional sub-sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Managing Individual Customers

Within each sub-section, individual customer entries are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Each customer entry displays the total payment amount currently due from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Methods for managing individual customers:
*   **Editing customer names:** Click the pencil icon next to a customer's name to modify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Updating due amounts:** Click on the current due amount to enter a new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Adding new customers:** A specific option is available for adding new customer names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Deleting customers:** Click the three-dot menu next to a customer entry and select "delete" to remove them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Integration with the Tracker

Once the customer database is populated with customer names and their respective due amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, this information feeds into other parts of the tracker:

*   **Summary Section:** The tracker's left-side summary displays:
    *   Total amount of payment due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
    *   Total payment amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
    *   The difference between due and received amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
    *   The percentage of total payments received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

*   **Overview Section:** This section provides a summary of:
    *   Total payment received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   Payment amount that was due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   The percentage of payment received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

*   **Transaction Section:** This section allows users to record individual transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. When entering a transaction, users can select the customer name from a list populated by the customer database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Details such as the transaction date, description, and amount can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. There is also a document section to attach specific invoices related to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Filling these details updates the "payment received" amount automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

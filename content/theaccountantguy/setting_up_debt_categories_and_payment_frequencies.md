The debt payment tracker is designed to help users manage and pay off their debts efficiently by organizing them into various categories and tracking payment frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Debt Overview Section

The debt overview section classifies debts into different categories, such as annual and monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Key details captured for each debt include:
*   **Debt Details**: A description of the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Loan Amount**: The total amount of the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount**: The amount paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: The specified interest rate for the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Initial Repayment**: The first date an installment will be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Debt Free By**: A calculated date showing when the debt is expected to be paid off based on the repayment amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Number of EMIs**: The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Managing Payment Frequencies

The system allows for flexible management of [[managing_installments_and_payment_schedules | payment schedules]] and categories:

### Adding New Categories
Users can add new payment frequency categories, such as "weekly" or "quarterly," by clicking the "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This automatically inserts the new [[managing_installments_and_payment_schedules | repayment schedule]] option into the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Pre-existing categories include annual, monthly, quarterly, and weekly repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Moving Debts Between Categories
Any existing debt can be moved to a different [[managing_installments_and_payment_schedules | repayment schedule]] category by selecting the debt's line item and dragging it to the desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Moving a debt automatically updates its [[managing_installments_and_payment_schedules | repayment schedule]] and other associated calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding New Debts
To add a new debt, users can click the "added details" button, which initially places the debt in a "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Once added, the debt can be moved to the appropriate frequency category and its [[tracking_debt_payments_and_liabilities | loan details]] can be filled in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Editing Existing Debt Details
Existing [[tracking_debt_payments_and_liabilities | loan details]] can be edited by clicking on the debt field and typing in the desired changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. These updates are automatically reflected across all relevant columns and descriptions in the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

The Investment Portfolio tracker in Notion allows users to organize and track their investments by categorizing them into groups like stocks, cryptos, and custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This feature enables a clear overview of different investment types and their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Initial Setup of Investment Categories

Upon first using the Investment Portfolio tracker, an "investment section" is provided, already divided into "stocks" and "cryptos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Users can also add their own custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. For each added investment, users need to input the opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

In the portfolio section, these investments are displayed, classified under their respective groups such as stocks, cryptos, or any user-defined groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This section reflects the investment value and available units after all transactions have been carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Adding New Investment Categories

Users can add new investment categories to better organize their portfolio. This is part of the [[organizing_investments_into_groups_such_as_stocks_and_crypto_in_notion | organizing investments into groups such as stocks and crypto in Notion]] functionality.

### Using the Quick Action Button
To quickly add a new investment and classify it:
1.  Click the "Add Investment" quick action button in the portfolio section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This adds a new investment entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
2.  Click the "pencil icon" next to the newly added investment to open a panel for details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
3.  Type in the investment name (e.g., "X investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
4.  Enter the opening balance (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
5.  By default, it will be under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. To classify it, click the three-dot icon and move it to an existing category like "stocks" or "crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Creating a New Custom Group
To create a completely new category, similar to [[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | customizing categories in Notion expense tracker]]:
1.  Click the "plus icon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
2.  A prompt will ask to "create a new group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
3.  Type in the desired category name, such as "bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
4.  This action automatically adds a new section for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Modifying Existing Categories

To edit an already existing category or investment entry, similar to [[modifying_and_adding_new_expense_categories_in_notion | modifying and adding new expense categories in Notion]]:
1.  Click on the item you wish to edit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
2.  Type in the changes you want to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
3.  Click "Done" to apply the modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

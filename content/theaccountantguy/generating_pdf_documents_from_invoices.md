This article explores how to track invoice payments using a Notion template and subsequently generate PDF documents for those invoices using PDFOutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Notion Invoice Payment Tracker Template

The Notion template provides a comprehensive system for managing invoice payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

At the top of the template, an invoice payment summary displays essential KPIs:
*   Total expenses incurred through invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   Total units purchased across all invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Average invoice price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
These KPIs can be customized or updated to suit specific business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Client Summary

A client summary section details purchase information for each client, including:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Number of units purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Average purchase value from each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
For example, for "11 Enterprises," the template shows a total purchase of $189 and 44 units purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Invoice Database Details

The core of the tracker is a database where all invoice details can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
Fields include:
*   Invoice number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Invoice date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Company name (issuing the invoice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   Bill-to section and client address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   Description of purchased items (e.g., "item one," "item two") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Quantity and unit price for each item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Subtotal (calculated as quantity Ã— unit price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   Total amount (computed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   Notes (e.g., payment receipt date, mode of payment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

#### Customization
To add more items beyond the default two, duplicate existing columns and update the formula for the subtotal to include the new columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Similarly, for total quantities purchased, the formula in the "total quantities purchased" property needs to be updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Changes made in the database, such as altering input values, automatically update the total expenses and units purchased displayed in the KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

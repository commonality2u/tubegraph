The monthly budget tab is a core component of a [[personal_finance_tracking | personal finance tracker]] developed in Google Sheets, designed to help users set and manage their monthly income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is one of the [[components_of_the_budget_tracker | five different tabs]] available in the tracker, alongside instructions, investment dashboard, sinking fund analysis, and debt payment report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Overview of the Monthly Budget Tab
The [[monthly_and_yearly_budget_overviews | monthly budget tab]] is divided into two primary sections:
*   **Expenses Overview** on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Income Overview** on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Most highlighted areas in this tab are auto-computed based on values entered in the [[entering_and_tracking_transactions_in_notion_budget_planner | transactions area]] on the right side of the sheet, meaning they do not require manual editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Tracking Expenses
To utilize the expense tracking feature:
1.  **Set Expenses** You need to define your regular monthly expenses, such as gas bills, Wi-Fi bills, and phone bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
2.  **Assign Month** Each expense can be assigned to a specific month by double-clicking and selecting a date within that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  **Input Budgeted Amount** For each expense, you set a [[budget_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | budgeted amount]] for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For example, a phone bill might be budgeted at $1,400 for March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
4.  **Enter Transactions** To record an actual expense, go to the transactions area, select the date, choose the expense category (e.g., "phone bills"), and enter the actual amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
5.  **Monitor Status** The tracker automatically updates the actual expense incurred, calculates the difference between the [[budget_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | budgeted amount and actual amount]], and indicates whether you are "under budget" or "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If an entry exceeds the budgeted amount (e.g., $1,500 vs. $1,400 budget), it will reflect "over budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Tracking Income
The income section operates on similar principles to the expense section:
*   You can set all income sources for respective months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Set a targeted income amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   As entries are made in the transaction area, the income overview automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Dynamic Overviews and Reports
The monthly budget tab provides several dynamic overviews:
*   **Overall Budget vs. Actual** A dynamic overview on the left shows the total [[budgeted_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | budgeted amount]], total actual expenses incurred, and the difference between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Graphical Representation (Expenses)** A quick graphical presentation visually compares the [[budgeted_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | budgeted amount]] (left bar) against the actual expense amount (right bar) for all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This graph updates dynamically as expense entries change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Income Overview** Similarly, an income overview on the right displays the total targeted income, actual income achieved, and the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It also includes a graph comparing targeted vs. actual income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Reporting Section
The dedicated reporting section allows users to dynamically view their [[monthly_and_yearly_budget_overviews | monthly and yearly budget overviews]] by selecting specific income or expense categories and choosing a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. For example, selecting "income" and "January" will show the total income for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This section also includes a pie chart reflecting the total division of income or expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Purpose and Flexibility
This monthly budget tracker is designed primarily for individual purposes but can also be adapted for [[budgeting_and_tracking_business_expenses | business purposes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It helps set all expenses (including bills, subscriptions, and other expenditures) and track income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The entire [[personal_finance_tracking | personal finance tracker]] is fully dynamic, providing quick insights into financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

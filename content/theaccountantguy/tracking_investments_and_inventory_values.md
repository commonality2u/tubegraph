This guide outlines how to manage and track [[investment_tracking_and_dashboard_analysis | investments]] and inventory within the business cash flow template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This template allows for detailed tracking of units, prices, and values, and helps in calculating profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Accounts Setup for Investments and Inventory

Within the "Account section" of the template, you can set up different categories for your assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

*   **Asset Class**: When adding or editing assets, you can specify an "asset class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This is relevant for:
    *   **Inventory**: All inventory items should be categorized under the "inventory asset class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   **Investments**: All [[investment_tracking_and_dashboard_analysis | investments]] should be categorized under the "investment asset class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Opening Units and Balance**: For inventory and [[investment_tracking_and_dashboard_analysis | investments]], you can specify "opening units" and an "opening balance" to represent the starting quantity and value when you begin using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For example, inventory might have an opening of 10 units with a value of $1300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Tracking Transactions

The template provides specific views and fields for managing [[adding_and_managing_investment_transactions | investment]] and inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. You can add new transactions for either by selecting the respective views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Tracking Investments

*   **Details Tracked**: In the "Investments" view, you can record details such as the units of [[adding_and_managing_investment_transactions | investments]] purchased and their price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The system can show the "investment value" which is the purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Transaction Types**:
    *   **Purchase Transactions**: When entering a purchase transaction for an [[adding_and_managing_investment_transactions | investment]], the "investment value" will reflect the purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
    *   **Sale Transactions**: For sales, you can enter the sale value of units and the price, allowing the system to show the total value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss Calculation**: The template automatically calculates profit or loss on [[adding_and_managing_investment_transactions | investment]] sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Business Activity Classification**: [[adding_and_managing_investment_transactions | Investment]]-related activities, such as buying stocks or mutual funds, are classified under "investing activities" in the "business activity" overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For instance, an inflow of $700 and an outflow of $1200 from investing activities would show a net balance of -$500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Tracking Inventory

*   **Details Tracked**: In the "Inventory" view, you can specify the units and price of inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Transaction Types**:
    *   **Purchased Inventory**: You can denote the total inventory value purchased at its purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Sold Inventory**: You can denote inventory that has been sold at its sale price, indicating the units and price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss Calculation**: The template automatically calculates profit or loss on inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Cash Flow Impact

When adding transactions for [[adding_and_managing_investment_transactions | investments]] or inventory, you need to assess whether the cash is flowing into or out of your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Inflow**: If cash is coming in, it's an inflow transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Outflow**: If cash is going out, it's an outflow transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

All transactions, including those related to [[investment_tracking_and_dashboard_analysis | investments]] and inventory, contribute to the overall cash flow overview, affecting the total inflow, outflow, and closing balance, which are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

The travel expense tracker is a tool designed to [[tracking_income_and_expenses | keep track]] of all travel expenses and facilitate planning ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It is structured with a summary section that includes accounts, expenses, and an overall summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Setting Up Expense Accounts

To begin, users set up different expense categories under the "accounts" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Common classifications include travel, meals, and lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Adding and Modifying Expense Sources

*   **Adding a new source:** Click "add expense source" to automatically add a new entry to the travel category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Editing details:** Use the pencil icon to modify the name (e.g., "Metro") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Setting budgeted amounts:** A budgeted amount can be set for each expense source, for instance, $1,500 for Metro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Moving categories:** Expense sources can be moved between existing categories (e.g., from travel to meals) using the three-dots icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Creating New Categories

A new, separate expense group can be created by clicking the plus sign on the right side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Existing groups can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Each expense source should have a set budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Tracking and Analyzing Expenses

The "expenses" section provides an overview of [[tracking_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | total expenses incurred]], the budgeted amount for each, and the percentage spent relative to the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Expense Overview

*   **Over-budget:** If an expense exceeds its budget, it is indicated in red. For example, a flight costing $2,000 against a $1,000 budget would show as 200% spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Within budget:** Expenses within the budgeted amount are shown in green. For instance, a breakfast costing $100 against a $300 budget would show as 33% spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | classification]] provides a quick glance at spending across different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Overall Summary

The summary section presents a complete overview, including:
*   Total budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
*   The difference between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   A percentage reflecting total expenses divided by budgeted expenses (e.g., $3,600 incurred against $6,800 budgeted shows 59% reached) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

Expenses are categorized under travel, meals, and lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Quick addition buttons are available for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Steps to Add an Expense

1.  Click the appropriate button (e.g., "add travel expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
2.  A new expense entry appears with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
3.  Add a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
4.  Enter trip information (e.g., "Trip to Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This can be edited via the three-dots icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
5.  Select the account of the expense (e.g., "train" for travel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
6.  Enter the amount of the expense (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, the expenses summary reflects the incurred amount for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If a budgeted amount is set for the expense, the tracker will automatically reflect the percentage spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. For example, if a train expense of $100 is booked against a $200 budget, it shows 50% incurred in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

This system allows users to understand their spending status and [[setting_budget_goals_and_tracking_progress | plan their expenses]] effectively as each new expense is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

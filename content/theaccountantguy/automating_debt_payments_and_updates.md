This article outlines how a [[overview_of_debt_payment_tracker | debt payment tracker]] system automates various aspects of [[tracking_debt_payments_and_liabilities | tracking debt payments and liabilities]], from managing [[setting_up_debt_categories_and_payment_frequencies | debt categories]] to updating payment progress. The system, demonstrated by "the accountant guy," aims to help users pay off their debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Automated Updates and Calculations

The system automates several key calculations and updates based on user input:
*   **Debt Overview Section** The debt overview provides details such as loan amount, EMI amount, interest rate, initial repayment date, and the "debt free by" calculation, which estimates when a specific debt will be paid off if repayments continue at a specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It also calculates the number of EMIs needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Repayment Schedule Updates** When a debt is moved to a different repayment schedule (e.g., quarterly), the repayment schedule and all associated details automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Debt Payoff Progress** The "debt payoff progress" section automatically reflects changes made in the installment section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It shows the total amount repaid, the net payoff in percentage, the projected debt-free date, the total interest paid, and the principal amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Transaction Section Updates**
    *   Ticking or unticking the "paid" column for an installment automatically updates its status, moving it between "paid" and "unpaid" sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
    *   The next repayment schedule is automatically generated based on the debt's previously set payment frequency. For example, a monthly payment on September 30 will generate an October 30 next payment date, and an annual payment on September 27, 2023, will generate a September 27, 2024, next payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Real-time Reflection** Any changes to the EMI amount in the transaction section are immediately reflected in the "debt payoff progress" section, ensuring all totals are accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Automated Management Features

The system also includes features that streamline the management of debt details and payments:

*   **Adding Payment Categories** Users can add new [[setting_up_debt_categories_and_payment_frequencies | debt categories]] or installment periods, such as "weekly," which are automatically inserted into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Adding New Debts** A "pay debt amount" button automatically adds a new debt payment entry to the schedule based on the current date, opening up fields for details and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Alternatively, a "add details" button quickly adds a new debt to the "no payment frequency" column, which can then be moved to a specific frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This contributes to [[building_databases_for_debt_tracking | building databases for debt tracking]].
*   **Editing Existing Loans** Clicking on a debt field allows users to edit existing loan details, and these changes are automatically updated across all relevant columns and descriptions in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Managing Installments** The system allows for [[managing_installments_and_payment_schedules | managing installments and payment schedules]] by automatically calculating the next repayment date based on the set frequency, which assists in [[automating_loan_repayment_notifications | automating loan repayment notifications]] and [[automation_of_recurring_payment_notifications | automation of recurring payment notifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

Notion can be utilized to track all your customer and vendor balances within an accounts receivable and payable tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The setup begins in the "Accounts" view, which is part of the "Receivable and Payable Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Accounts View

The "Accounts" view is where you can set up your customer and vendor details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This includes their opening balances and the number of invoices due against those opening balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. For example, a setup might show two customers and one vendor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Adding Customers and Vendors

You can add new customers or vendors quickly using dedicated quick action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

*   **Add Vendor**: Clicking the "Add vendor" button will swiftly add a vendor detail entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Add Customer**: Similarly, clicking a button to "Add customer" will automatically create a new customer entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Editing Details

Once an entry is added, click on the pencil icon associated with it to start editing all the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Entering Balances and Pending Invoices

After adding a customer or vendor, you can input their opening balance, which is their starting receivable or payable balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. You can also specify the number of invoices that are pending against this amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## How Details Reflect

The details entered for customers and vendors directly impact other sections of the tracker. For instance, the [[setting_up_a_customer_payments_tracker_in_notion | receivable section]] will reflect all receivable accounts with their respective details, such as transactions and invoice statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. If an invoice has been paid, checking a box will ensure that amount is not calculated in the outstanding balance displayed at the top for that specific customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Similarly, the payable section will show details for each vendor transaction, including the invoice date, number, status, and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Marking an item as paid will adjust the outstanding balances at the top for vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

These customer and vendor setups form the foundation for [[managing_customer_information_in_notion | managing customer information in Notion]] and [[using_notion_for_client_management | client management]] within the system. This process is a key part of [[setting_up_databases_and_relationships_in_notion | setting up databases and relationships in Notion]] for financial tracking.

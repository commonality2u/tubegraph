This guide explains how to set up customer and vendor details within an [[setting_up_a_customer_payments_tracker_in_notion | accounts receivable and payable tracker]] in Notion. This system allows you to track all your customer and vendor balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Accounts View

The process begins in the "receivable and payable account section" at the top of the tracker, which features four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The first of these is the "accounts view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

In this view, you can:
*   Set up your customer and vendor details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Enter their opening balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   Specify the number of invoices due against those opening balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

For instance, the template might already include two customers and one vendor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Adding Customer or Vendor Details

To add a new customer or vendor:
1.  **Use Quick Action Buttons**: There's a "quick action button" on the left side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  **Add Vendor**: Click "ADD vendor" to quickly add a vendor detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
3.  **Add Customer**: Click the "add a customer" button to automatically add a customer entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
4.  **Edit Details**: Once an entry is added, click the pencil icon to begin editing all the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

After adding the basic details:
*   Feed in the "opening balance," which is the starting balance for receivables or payables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Input the "invoices that are pending" against this amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Once these details are entered, they will automatically update across all relevant sections of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

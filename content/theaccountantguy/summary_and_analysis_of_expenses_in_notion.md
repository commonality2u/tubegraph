A Notion template is available to serve as an [[using_notion_as_an_expense_tracker | Notion expenses tracker]] that can help [[using_notion_for_expense_management | utilize the Notion expenses tracker]] to manage [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | all your expenses]] in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This template is designed to be highly customizable to fit various personal or business tracking needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Expense Categories

The tracker includes a category section at the top, initially featuring three predefined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. These categories can be customized to suit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Managing Categories
*   **Renaming**: Hover over a category to reveal a pencil icon. Clicking this allows you to rename the category as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Deleting**: To delete an existing category, click on the three dots next to it and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Adding New**: A new category can be added by clicking on the "new page" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Tracking Expenses

Each category in the tracker displays both a [[budget_and_actual_expense_tracking_in_notion | budgeted expense amount]] and an [[budget_and_actual_expense_tracking_in_notion | actual expense amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. As expenses are entered into the system, the corresponding categories automatically update with the respective amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Summary Section

The template features a dedicated summary section for an overview of your financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This section displays:
*   The total [[budget_and_actual_expense_tracking_in_notion | budgeted expense amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   The total [[budget_and_actual_expense_tracking_in_notion | actual expenses amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budget that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The actual expenses in the summary are computed automatically from the expense entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Setting Budgets

Users can set their own [[budget_and_actual_expense_tracking_in_notion | budgeted expense amounts]] by clicking on the budget field within each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Any changes made to these figures will be reflected in the overall total budget and subsequently updated in the summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

This template allows users to [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | keep track of all your requirements and track your expenses]] efficiently in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, offering versatility for personal or business financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This article demonstrates how a Notion template can be utilized to track inventory for small businesses, focusing on its organizational and analytical features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The template is presented by Sanat Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Inventory Portfolio Overview

The inventory tracking template features an "Inventory Portfolio" section with three distinct views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   Inventory Setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Inventory Portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Inventory Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

## Inventory Setup

The Inventory Setup section allows for [[categories_and_classifications_in_bookkeeping | three classifications]] of inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>:
*   Raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Work in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Finished goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

Each inventory item includes specific details:
*   **Opening Balance**: The starting balance of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units**: The initial count of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Valuation Principle**: Options like FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LIFO (Last-In, First-Out), and WSC (Weighted Average Cost) are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Users can leave this as default if unsure, as it will not affect other reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Reorder Level**: A defined unit level at which the inventory should be reordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, wheat might have a reorder level of 60 units, and corn 10 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Percentage**: Indicates the proportion of a particular inventory item relative to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Adding New Inventory
To add a new inventory item, click the "Add Inventory" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The new item will initially appear in a "no classification" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Users can then move it to a [[categories_and_classifications_in_bookkeeping | specific category]], such as "work in progress," by dragging it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. After moving, details can be entered by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Inventory Portfolio (View)

This section provides an overview of inventory values and stock levels after all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Inventory Value**: The value of the inventory at the end of the transaction period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Number of Units Available**: The total units remaining after purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Reorder Status Level**: This feature indicates whether an item needs to be reordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. If the available units drop below the set reorder level, a "low stock" message appears, prompting a reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Conversely, if units are significantly above the reorder level, it indicates surplus and no immediate need to reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

This view helps users quickly assess inventory levels across the [[categories_and_classifications_in_bookkeeping | three different categories]] to ensure sufficient units are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Inventory Status

This section tracks the current status of inventory items, such as their location or whether they have been received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
Common statuses include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>:
*   In Transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   In Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   Not Sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>

Users can edit existing statuses or add new ones as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The view shows a count of items under each status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. For example, if one purchase is "in transit," clicking on it will reveal details such as the item, quantity, amount, and date of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Items can be moved between statuses by clicking the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section manages purchases and sales, and calculates profit and loss for inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Purchases and Sales
Transactions are dated and automatically divided by month, with newer entries appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
Each transaction includes:
*   **Description**: A field for additional details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Account**: The specific inventory item involved in the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Number of Units**: The quantity of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Purchase/Sale Price**: The cost or revenue per unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Inventory Status**: The current status of that particular transaction (e.g., in transit, not sent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This status can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

A "Buy Inventory" quick action button automatically adds a purchase transaction to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The sales section operates similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Profit and Loss
For each sale, users input the purchase or manufacturing cost of the item sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The template then automatically calculates the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. For example, if bread is sold for $40 and its manufacturing cost was $10, the profit per unit is $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If 30 units were sold, the total profit would be $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

This [[customizing_inventory_templates | template]] allows for comprehensive tracking of inventory, its status, and financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

The "Transactions Tab" is one of three primary tabs in the personal finance tracker, alongside the "Dashboard" and "Budget" tabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This tab is used to [[adding_and_managing_transactions | add new transactions]] related to your income and expenses after you have specified accounts and budget estimations in the [[navigating_the_budget_tab_for_income_and_expenses | Budget tab]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## How to Enter Transaction Details

To [[adding_and_managing_transactions | add a new transaction]], navigate to the "Transactions" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Here, you will input details into several columns:

1.  **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
2.  **Details of the transaction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>
3.  **Category**: This column lists all the accounts previously added in the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
4.  **Income/Expense**: This is a formula-driven column that specifies whether the transaction is an income or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. When [[adding_and_managing_transactions | adding new line items]], simply drag the formula down to the new rows to ensure it copies correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
5.  **Amount**: Specify the monetary value related to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Once these details are entered, the "Transactions tab" is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The next step is to navigate to the "Dashboard" section to view an analysis of the added transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

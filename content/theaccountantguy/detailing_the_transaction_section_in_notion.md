The transaction section in this Notion template allows users to track all revenue and expense activities, which are crucial for calculating tax liabilities and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. All data entered into the transaction view at the bottom of the template automatically updates the summary sections at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. [[using_categories_and_transactions_in_notion | Transactions]] are classified into two main types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Adding Revenue Transactions

To add a new revenue transaction:
1.  Scroll down to the transaction section after setting up your revenue and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
2.  Click the "Add Revenue" button. This will automatically add a new line item for the revenue side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  The system automatically picks the current date when adding a new revenue entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
4.  **Select the Period:** Choose the relevant financial quarter. For example, September falls into Quarter 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. There are typically four predefined periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
5.  **Select the Account:** Choose from the revenue accounts you have previously set up, such as "Goods" or "Services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
6.  **Enter the Amount:** Input the revenue amount, for instance, $1000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
7.  **Input Tax Rate:** Specify the applicable tax rate, for example, 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The system automatically calculates the tax payable based on this rate, such as $80 for a $1000 transaction at 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Adding Expense Transactions

Adding an expense transaction follows a similar process:
1.  Click the "Add Expense" button, which automatically adds a new expense entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  Fill in details such as the quarter (e.g., Quarter 3), the expense account (e.g., "Purchases"), the amount (e.g., $500), and the tax rate (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
3.  The system calculates the input credit based on the entered amount and tax rate, for example, $50 for a $500 transaction at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Impact on Summaries

Once [[adding_and_editing_transactions_in_notion | transactions]] are entered in this section, they directly influence the summary views at the top of the template:
*   The total tax payable displayed in the quarterly taxes section is updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   The tax liability is automatically recalculated, showing the net tax payable after accounting for input tax credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. For example, if tax payable is $280 and input tax is $10, the liability shown will be $270 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   The [[expense_detail_and_overview_sections_in_notion | profit and loss]] section also updates, reflecting total revenue, expenses, and the overall profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Notion provides a comprehensive setup for [[tracking_personal_finances_using_notion | tracking personal finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, including dedicated sections for managing recurring expenses like bills and subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Tracking Bills

The Notion finance tracker includes a specific section for [[creating_a_bills_tracker_in_notion | tracking bills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23">[01:23]</a>, showing upcoming and past payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This section can be customized to individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Setting Up Bill Accounts

To start [[tracking_expenses_with_Notion | tracking expenses]] that are bills:
1.  Navigate to the "Account" section under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:10">[02:55:10]</a>.
2.  Under the "Expenses" category, specify your bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:12">[02:55:12]</a>.
3.  Add a new expense by clicking "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:23">[02:55:23]</a>.
4.  Enter the name (e.g., "Wi-Fi bills") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:27">[02:55:27]</a>.
5.  Set the classification as "bills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:34">[02:55:34]</a>.
6.  Set the payment frequency (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:36">[02:55:36]</a>.

### Adding Bill Transactions

After setting up bill accounts, record transactions:
1.  Go to the "Expense" section under "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>.
2.  Enter bill payment details:
    *   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:08">[02:26:08]</a>
    *   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:09">[02:26:09]</a>
    *   Necessary account for the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:12">[02:26:12]</a>
    *   Payment mode (e.g., bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:14">[02:26:14]</a>
    *   Transaction type: "Outflow" (as money is paid out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:16">[02:26:16]</a>
    *   Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:21">[02:26:21]</a>

### Viewing Bill Summary

Once transactions are entered, navigate to the "Bills" section under "Summary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>. This view displays two payment statuses:
*   **Upcoming Payments:** Bills whose next payment due date is after the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:40">[02:26:40]</a>. For example, if a monthly utility bill was last paid on August 17th, the next payment is expected on September 17th, appearing in this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:54">[02:26:54]</a>.
*   **Past Payments:** Bills that were due in the past and have not yet been paid in the interim period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42">[02:42]</a>. For instance, if a weekly grocery bill was last paid on August 20th and the current date is August 30th, and no payment was recorded for August 27th, it will show under past payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:17">[02:27:17]</a>.

The view also shows the total amount paid so far for each bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36">[02:36]</a>.

## Tracking Subscriptions

The Notion finance tracker can also [[tracking_expenses_with_Notion | track subscriptions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:11">[02:09:11]</a>.

### Setting Up Subscription Accounts

To set up accounts for subscriptions:
1.  Go to the "Account" section under "Get Started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:13">[02:09:13]</a>.
2.  Under "Expenses," specify subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:16">[02:09:16]</a>.
3.  Add a new subscription (e.g., "Amazon") by clicking "New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:33">[02:09:33]</a>.
4.  Classify it under "Subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:43">[02:09:43]</a>.
5.  Set the payment frequency (e.g., quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:45">[02:09:45]</a>.

### Adding Subscription Transactions

To record subscription payments:
1.  Navigate to the "Expenses" view under "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12">[03:12]</a>.
2.  Add a new transaction by selecting a date (e.g., August 17th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18">[03:18]</a>.
3.  Enter the description (e.g., "Amazon") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27">[03:27]</a>.
4.  Select the relevant subscription account (e.g., "Amazon") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[03:33]</a>.

6.  Set the transaction type as "Outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46">[03:46]</a>.
7.  Input the amount (e.g., $120) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>.

### Viewing Subscription Summary

The "Subscription" view under "Summary" displays upcoming and past subscription payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>:
*   **Upcoming Payments:** Payments due after the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This includes subscriptions with future payment dates based on their frequency and last payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Past Payments:** Subscriptions for which a payment was due in the past but hasn't been recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. For example, if a weekly subscription was last paid on August 17th, and the current date is August 30th, it expects a payment on August 24th, and if none is entered, it moves to "Past Payments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

The view also shows the subscription status (e.g., "Active") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20">[03:20]</a>. If the status isn't visible for a new account, it can be enabled via the edit icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24">[03:24]</a>.

## General Notion Features for Tracking

### Customizing Views
Users can change the layout of the debt and bills sections (and likely others) from a board view to a list or gallery format to suit their preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Properties displayed within these views can also be enabled or disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### Filtering Transactions by Account
For a quick view of transactions related to a specific account (e.g., "salary" or "side hustle"), click on the account name in the summary view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44">[03:44]</a>. This will open a window on the right side displaying only the transactions associated with that particular account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59">[03:59]</a>.

### Currency Support
Notion supports multiple currencies. To change the currency display, click on any amount field with a dollar sign, go to "Edit property," select "Number format," and choose the desired currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. This needs to be done for each view where currency is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

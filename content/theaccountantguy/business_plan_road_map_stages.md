The business plan template is designed with two primary views: the business plan roadmap and the [[using_events_timeline_in_business_planning | events timeline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The roadmap component provides a structured approach to outlining a business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Business Plan Roadmap Overview

The business plan roadmap divides the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The template pre-defines 11 stages, each with a specific name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Examples of these stages include:
*   Conception & Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning & Structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Profitability & Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

Users have the flexibility to edit the names of these stages to fit their specific business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Defining Objectives and Tasks

For each stage within the roadmap, users can:
*   **[[setting_objectives_for_a_business_plan | Define objectives]]**: Specific objectives can be set for the overall business plan and correlated to a particular stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. For instance, the "Planning & Structuring" stage might have the objective of creating a "blueprint business plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **List associated tasks**: Each stage includes various tasks that need to be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. These tasks can have a deadline for completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. New tasks can be added as required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Track status and completion**: Tasks have a checkbox to indicate completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Once a task is marked complete, its status can be assigned (e.g., "completed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Documentation**: A dedicated section at the bottom of each stage allows for detailed documentation of objectives and tasks, providing more context for that specific planning stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Completion Tracking

The template automatically calculates the completion percentage for each stage based on the tasks marked as complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For example, if a stage has two tasks, completing one will show 50% completion, while completing both will show 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This percentage is prominently displayed at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Events Timeline View

In addition to the roadmap, the [[using_events_timeline_in_business_planning | events timeline]] view presents all planned stages and tasks in a calendar or timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This view highlights specific deadline dates and shows the stage name, associated tasks, dates, and current status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This offers a quick visual overview of the entire business plan's progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

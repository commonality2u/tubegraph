This article explains how to utilize a Notion template to [[setting_up_emergency_funds_using_notion | track emergency funds]] and their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template provides a comprehensive financial overview, allowing users to monitor their savings progress towards specific goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Template Summary Sections

The template is organized into three main sections visible at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:
*   **Fund Setup** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Savings Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Overall Summary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

## Fund Setup

The "Fund Setup" section is where you define and organize your individual emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Categories
Funds are initially organized into default categories:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

These categories can be [[organizing_funds_into_categories_for_financial_management | customized]] by editing existing ones or adding new groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Adding and Customizing Funds
To add a new fund, click the "add fund" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. New funds initially appear under a "no classification" tab and can be moved to a relevant category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Each fund allows for the input of several key details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:
*   **Fund Detail**: A description for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance**: The initial amount in the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: The targeted savings amount for this specific emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Start Date**: The date you begin contributing to this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Target End Date**: The date by which you aim to have the total emergency fund available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The template automatically calculates the savings made to date based on these inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The names of the emergency funds can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This flexibility allows for [[customizing_emergency_fund_templates_in_notion | customizing emergency fund templates in Notion]].

## Contributions Section

This section is dedicated to recording monthly contributions to your emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Organizing Contributions
Contributions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. It also indicates the number of contributions made for each specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Recording Contributions
For each contribution, you can enter the following details:
*   **Date**: The date of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief description of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Period**: The month and year of the contribution (e.g., March 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. New months can be added as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Fund**: Select the specific emergency fund to which the contribution is being made from a list of the funds you've set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The actual amount of savings or contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Requirement**: This automatically calculated column shows the required monthly contribution to reach the targeted end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. If the "Amount" entered is equal to or greater than the "Requirement," a tick mark appears, indicating that the [[monthly_donation_tracking_and_meeting_targets | monthly target has been met]] for that specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

A "quick action" button automatically adds a new line item for the current month and date, streamlining the process of adding contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This feature aids in [[setting_and_tracking_budgeted_expenses | setting and tracking budgeted expenses]].

## Quarterly Overview

The "Quarterly Overview" provides a glance view of all months within each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This helps in understanding your progress against savings requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

For each month within a quarter, it displays:
*   Total savings made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   The required savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   The percentage of the savings requirement met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Color coding is used to provide a quick visual snapshot of financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This view helps in [[quarterly_overview_for_emergency_savings | quarterly overview for emergency savings]]. It also displays the total savings for each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Savings Overview

The "Savings Overview" is categorized similarly to the "Fund Setup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. For each emergency fund, it displays detailed information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>:
*   **Total Savings**: The accumulated savings, including the starting balance and all contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings**: The goal amount set for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved**: How much of the total savings requirement has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings Date**: The chosen end date for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Months Left**: The remaining time until the targeted end date, calculated from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Contribution Required Per Month**: The calculated monthly contribution needed to meet the target by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

This section offers a comprehensive overview of each fund's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Overall Summary

The "Overall Summary" section provides a high-level view of all emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>:
*   **Total Savings**: The combined sum of opening balances and all contributions across all funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Savings Required**: The total sum of all targeted savings amounts across all funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The total savings minus the savings required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage**: The overall percentage of total savings achieved against the total targeted savings amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

This provides a complete summary of your emergency fund financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The entire template can be customized to suit individual needs and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, including [[creating_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | creating a savings funds tracker in Notion]] and [[using_notion_for_charity_donation_tracking | tracking charity donations]]. While not directly related to this topic, the principles of [[setting_up_charity_funds_in_notion | setting up charity funds in Notion]] are similar.

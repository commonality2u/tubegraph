## Fund Setup

The "Fund Setup" section allows you to define and manage individual emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Categories
Emergency funds are initially organized into three default categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

These categories are customizable; you can edit existing ones or add new groups as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Adding a New Fund
To add a new fund, click the "Add Fund" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A new fund will appear under a "No Classification" tab, which you can then move to its respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Fund Details
Each fund has several key details you can specify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:
*   **Fund Detail**: A descriptive name for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

*   **Target End Date**: The date by which you aim to have the total emergency fund available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:50]</a>.

The template automatically calculates the savings made to date based on these inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:44]</a>.

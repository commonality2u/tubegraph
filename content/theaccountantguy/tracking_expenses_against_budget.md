A business budget template can be utilized to keep [[tracking_expenses|track of budgeting]] for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This template helps in managing and comparing budgeted amounts against actual expenditures.

## Template Sections

The business budget template is structured into three main sections: the account section, the expenses section, and the summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Account Section
In the account section, different heads of expenses can be set up under categories such as operational, administration, or marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Adding Categories:** Users can add new categories by scrolling to the right and clicking a plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Editing Categories:** Existing categories can be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Budgeted Amount:** Once categories are set up, a budgeted amount can be specified for each head of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A new account can also be added under an operation category, with its corresponding budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Expenses Section
The expenses section provides a view of current expenses in comparison to the budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This section updates dynamically as transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Visual Indicators:**
    *   Expenses exceeding the budgeted amount are indicated in red and show a high percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
    *   Expenses within the budgeted amount are indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Summary Section
The summary section reflects key financial figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Total expenses incurred so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   The percentage of budgeted expense that was set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The transaction section at the bottom allows users to [[tracking_income_expenses_and_cash_flow_movements|book expenses]] under different heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Expenses are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

*   **Adding Expenses:**
    *   Expenses can be added quickly using buttons on the left, such as an "operational expense" button, which automatically adds an expense with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   Details like description and amount can then be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   Expenses can be associated with relevant accounts previously added in the account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   Dates for expenses can be changed as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    *   A quick button at the top also allows for adding an expense source or using a "new" icon to quickly add an expense under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

This system allows for continuous [[tracking_expenses|booking of expenses]] for various business expenditures, utilizing the buttons on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

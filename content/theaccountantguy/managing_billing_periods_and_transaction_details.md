This article demonstrates how to utilize a subscription expenses tracker to [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | track all subscription expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Subscription Overview Section

The subscription overview section provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Categories View

Subscriptions are divided into two main [[managing_monthly_transactions_and_categories | categories]]:
*   Active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   Canceled subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

Under each category, you can find the following details for each subscription:
*   Name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Total [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | expenses]] incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   [[understanding_transaction_classifications_and_payment_frequencies | Billing period]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

The [[understanding_transaction_classifications_and_payment_frequencies | billing period]] can be changed by selecting from available options, though it is recommended not to change the names of the billing period options themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Expenses Section

The [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | expenses]] section is further divided into different sections or groups of subscriptions (e.g., infotainment, education, music) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   New groups can be added using a plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Existing groups can be edited by changing their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Under each classification of subscription, the following details are visible:
*   Name of subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Total [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Percentage of each subscription towards the total subscription [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | expenses]] incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Quick Actions

A "quick action" button allows for adding a new subscription, which initially appears under a "not subscribed" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This new subscription can then be moved to any classification and its details edited using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | transaction section]] is where all subscription [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | expenses]] are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Views

The section includes:
*   An "active subscriptions" view, showing all currently active subscriptions and their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   A "canceled subscription" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top, along with the total sum of [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | expenses]] for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Recording Transactions

To book [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | expenses]] for subscriptions, the following details are entered:
1.  **Status**: A checkbox indicates if the subscription is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Subscription Account**: This field pulls from the subscriptions added in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  **[[understanding_transaction_classifications_and_payment_frequencies | Billing Period]]**: Automatically pulled from the value set in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  **[[tracking_transactions_and_payment_percentages | Payment]] Date**: Users can choose any date for the [[tracking_transactions_and_payment_percentages | payment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
5.  **Amount**: The subscription [[tracking_transactions_and_expenses | expense]] amount is entered here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the [[understanding_transaction_classifications_and_payment_frequencies | billing period]] that has been set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, if Netflix was paid on September 30 with a monthly [[understanding_transaction_classifications_and_payment_frequencies | billing period]], the next renewal date would be October 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This calculation applies to annual and weekly subscriptions as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Cancelling Subscriptions

To cancel a subscription, simply click on the checkbox next to the subscription, which will automatically change its status to "canceled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Canceled subscriptions are reflected in both the [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | transaction section]] and the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Quick Add Transaction

A "quick add subscription" button allows for rapidly adding a new [[tracking_transactions_and_cash_flow_in_business | transaction]] where details can then be filled in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Customization

The tracker also includes a tutorial on how to change the currency displayed in the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

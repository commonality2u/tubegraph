Business plan templates can significantly simplify the planning process for your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These templates often come with structured views to help organize tasks and objectives effectively.

## Template Views

A typical business plan template offers two primary views to aid in planning:
*   The [[business_plan_roadmap_stages | business plan roadmap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   The [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | events timeline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

### Business Plan Roadmap

The [[business_plan_roadmap_stages | business plan roadmap]] breaks down the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For example, a template might pre-define 11 stages, each with a specific name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Stages can range from "conceptional research" to "profitability and scaling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Key features of the roadmap view include:
*   **Editable Stages** You can edit the predefined stages using a pencil icon to suit your specific business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Objectives** For each stage, you can define specific objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Completion Percentage** The template tracks the completion percentage for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This percentage automatically updates as associated tasks are marked complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, it shows 50% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **[[task_management_in_business_planning | Task Management]]** Clicking on a stage reveals the associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Each task can have a deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, a checkbox to indicate completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, and a customizable status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. New tasks can be added for any stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Documentation** A dedicated section at the bottom of each stage allows for detailed documentation of objectives and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Events Timeline

The [[events_timeline_for_business_planning | events timeline]] view presents all planned activities in a calendar or timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This view provides a quick overview of deadlines and the progression of stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

On the timeline, you can see:
*   Specific deadline dates for stages and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   The stage name and associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The status of each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Arrows that reflect specific dates, allowing you to navigate to and view details of all stages and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The employee training expenses tracker offers dedicated sections for [[managing_employee_details_in_notion | managing employee details]] and department records, facilitating organization and tracking of employee training progress and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Employee Records Overview
The training dashboard includes an "employee records" view that lists employees organized by their respective departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This view provides a quick overview of each employee's training status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

For each individual employee, the system displays:
*   The total number of trainings they have attended (e.g., "2 out of 3 trainings") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Their percentage of attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   The next scheduled training date, which can be selected to show the number of days remaining until that date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Department Management
Departments can be easily managed within the system:
*   **Editing Department Names**: To change a department's name, you can click on the department and begin editing the information directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Adding New Departments**: A new department can be added by dragging a slider to the right and clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Managing Employee Details
The "employee details" section, found at the bottom of the dashboard, allows for comprehensive management of employee records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Adding Employees
*   New employee records can be added by clicking the "add employee" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Newly added employees initially appear under a "no department" view if not categorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Editing Employees
*   To edit an employee's details, click the edit button and type the employee's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This automatically updates the employee's records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Organizing Employees by Department
*   Employees can be moved between departments by dragging their record to the desired department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Alternatively, clicking the three dots next to an employee's name allows for quick shifting to a different department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   For employees initially added without a department, they can be placed into any department by clicking the three dots next to their record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Employee Training Records
Within the "training record" section, you can manage which employees are assigned to and have attended specific training sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   For each training, you can select the employees who are supposed to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   A checkbox allows you to indicate if employees have attended a training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This action automatically updates the attendance percentage displayed in the training records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Multiple employees can be tagged for a single training, and the system automatically updates attendance figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   It is recommended to use the "add training" quick action button for adding new training records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> While it is possible to edit employee records or add new ones directly from the training database, it is suggested to use the dedicated quick action button provided for adding employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

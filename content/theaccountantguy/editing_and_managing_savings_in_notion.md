Notion offers a [[creating_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | savings funds tracker]] template designed to help users monitor their financial goals. This tracker includes a [[creating_and_tracking_budgets_and_savings_in_notion | savings funds dashboard]] with two primary views: the [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals_in_notion | Savings Target]] view and the [[creating_and_tracking_budgets_and_savings_in_notion | Savings Overview]] view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Savings Target View

The [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals_in_notion | Savings Target]] view allows you to define different saving funds and their corresponding [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals_in_notion | goal amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds

To edit an already added saving fund:
1.  Click the pencil button next to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  Rename the saving fund (e.g., changing "Emergency Fund" to "Car Fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Set a new [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals_in_notion | goal amount]] (e.g., changing $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
Changes made here will automatically update in the [[creating_and_tracking_budgets_and_savings_in_notion | Savings Overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Alternatively, you can click on the fund itself to open all options and edit the name or [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals_in_notion | goal amount]] from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds

To add a new savings fund:
1.  Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This will add a new entry below existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  Click the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
3.  Give the new fund a name (e.g., "New Saving Fund") and press Enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
4.  Set the [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals_in_notion | goal amount]] of your choice (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds

To delete a savings fund:
1.  Click the six dots located on the left of the fund entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  Select the "Delete" option that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The fund will be automatically removed from the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Savings Overview View

The [[creating_and_tracking_budgets_and_savings_in_notion | Savings Overview]] provides a summary of your [[creating_and_tracking_budgets_and_savings_in_notion | total savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It shows:
*   The [[creating_and_tracking_budgets_and_savings_in_notion | total savings]] made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   The targeted saving amount set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   The percentage of the targeted amount achieved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
Updates made in the [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals_in_notion | Savings Target]] view, or by adding transactions, will dynamically reflect in this overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Managing Transactions

To add or [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_notion | manage transactions]] related to your savings funds, navigate to the [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_notion | transactions panel]] at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Adding New Transactions

1.  Click the "Add Transaction" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A new transaction entry will appear with the current system date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
2.  You can adjust the date using the calendar window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  Enter a description for the saving (e.g., "saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
4.  In the "Saving Fund" column, select the specific saving fund it belongs to from the dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
5.  Input the saving amount for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The amount entered here will automatically be added to the [[creating_and_tracking_budgets_and_savings_in_notion | total savings]] for that fund in the [[creating_and_tracking_budgets_and_savings_in_notion | Savings Overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This allows for real-time tracking of progress towards your [[setting_savings_targets_and_goals_in_notion | savings target]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Grouping Transactions

Transactions are grouped by default by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. To change this grouping:
1.  Click the three dots within the transactions panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Go to "Grouping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
3.  You can then select to group by "Week" or "Year" instead of "Month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This dynamically changes how your [[creating_and_tracking_budgets_and_savings_in_notion | savings has been made]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Customization and Currency

This article demonstrates how to utilize a subscription expenses tracker, developed by Sanat Biswal (The Accountant Guy), to [[tracking_expenses | track all your subscription expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

The tracker features a "Subscription Overview" section that provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Key features in this section:
*   **Categories View** Subscriptions are divided into "active" and "canceled" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Subscription Details** Under each category, you'll find:
    *   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
    *   Total expenses incurred for that subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
    *   The billing period, which can be changed by selecting from available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It is not recommended to change the name of the billing period options themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Expenses Section

The "Expenses" section categorizes subscriptions into different groups, such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Key features in this section:

    *   The percentage each subscription contributes towards the total subscription expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Quick Action Button** An "Add Subscription" button automatically adds a new subscription under a "note subscription category" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This new entry can then be moved to any chosen classification (e.g., active) and edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction" section is where users input details to book subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This section supports [[transaction_tracking_and_management | transaction tracking and management]].

Visen is a platform designed to create AI-generated content directly within your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. To begin using Visen, initial settings must be configured, including defining a "connections database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This database serves as a central repository for all connections established between Visen and your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Accessing Visen Settings

The settings tab, where the connections database is defined, can be accessed by clicking the gear icon on the home screen or by selecting "settings" from the sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Defining the Connections Database

The process of defining the connections database involves duplicating a template and then linking it within Visen's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:

1.  **Open Template:** Click the icon on the right side of the "connection database" field in Visen's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This action opens a new template page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
2.  **Duplicate Template:** Duplicate this template into your local Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   Click "duplicate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   A pop-up will appear, allowing you to select your desired Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   Select your workspace and click "add to private" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   The connections database will automatically duplicate to your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
3.  **Copy and Paste URL:** Once duplicated, copy the URL of the new connections database from your Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Paste this URL into the connections database field within Visen's settings tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Connecting the Database to Visen Integration

After defining the URL in Visen settings and before proceeding to create AI content, you must establish the connection within Notion:

1.  **Access Notion Connections:** Go to the duplicated connections database in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
2.  **Add Connection:** Click the three dots in the top right corner of the Notion page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
3.  **Select Visen Integration:** Scroll down and select the "connections" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Type "Visen" and select the internal connection you created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Click "confirm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This step connects your Notion template to Visen via the previously generated [[connecting_notion_databases_with_templates | internal integration secret key]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Storing Connections

All connections created within Visen, such as those for generating content on [[linking_databases_and_creating_templates_in_notion | Notion pages]] or [[establishing_relationships_between_databases_in_notion | Notion databases]], are stored and updated within this connections database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. You can view, sort, filter, or delete these connections directly from this database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Local Storage

It's important to note that all settings and data entered into Visen, including the connections database URL and API keys, are saved in the local storage of your device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This ensures that the information is completely safe and secure, accessible only from the system you are using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. You can clear all defined data from local storage by clicking the "clear" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

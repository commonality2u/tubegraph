The Notion business expense tracker allows users to [[Using Notion for Expense Management | define]] and manage different expense categories incurred by a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This feature is central to [[Tracking income and expenses in Notion | tracking expenses]] effectively under a single general ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

2.  Make the desired changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Setting Budgeted Amounts
For each expense category, you can set a budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This amount will be automatically reflected in the [[Presentation of expense data in Notion | expenses overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. If you change a budgeted amount, for instance, from $100 to $5,000 for "advertising," the changes will automatically update in the expenses overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

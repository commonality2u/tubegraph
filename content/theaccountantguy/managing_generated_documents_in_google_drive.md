[[PDFoutput.com]] is a tool designed to [[generating_bulk_pdf_documents_using_google_docs_and_notion | generate PDF documents in bulk]] using a Google Document as a template and a Notion database for data [00:00:04]. When using [[PDFoutput.com]] to generate documents, Google Drive serves as a primary destination for the output files, allowing for organized storage and retrieval.

## Setting Google Drive as the Output Location

After [[setting_up_and_integrating_a_google_document_with_notion | setting up your Google Document]] and Notion database within [[PDFoutput.com]], you can specify Google Drive as the output location for your generated PDFs [00:03:59].

### Steps to Select Google Drive for Output:
1.  From the output location options, select "Google Drive" [00:04:01].
2.  Optionally, [[customizing_templates_and_databases_for_document_generation | create a new folder]] directly within your Google Drive to store the generated documents [00:04:05]. For instance, you can create a folder named "invitation documents" [00:04:14].
3.  Once the folder is created in Google Drive, return to [[PDFoutput.com]], click "add folder," and select the newly created folder from the list [00:04:26]. This defines the specific location for your output files [00:04:32].

> [!TIP]
> While Google Drive is an option, you can also opt to save the files directly to your desktop's downloads folder [00:04:35].

## Bulk Generation to Google Drive

Once all settings are configured, including the Google Drive output folder, you can initiate the [[bulk_pdf_document_generation_process | document generation process]] [00:05:15]. The system will begin generating the PDFs and saving them directly into the designated Google Drive folder [00:05:17].

> [!NOTE]
> The PDF generated count will increase as documents are created [00:05:23].

## Viewing Generated Documents

After the [[bulk_pdf_document_generation_process | documents are successfully generated]], you can view them directly in Google Drive by clicking the "view in Google Drive" option within [[PDFoutput.com]] [00:05:50]. This will open your Google Drive and display the newly created PDF files in the specified folder [00:05:52].

For example, if an invitation letter template was used with a Notion database containing names like "Jonty Roads," "Miller Stark," and "Priya Sharma," the generated PDFs in Google Drive will reflect these names in their respective documents [00:05:58]. This demonstrates how [[using_notion_as_a_database_for_pdf_generation | Notion as a database]] facilitates [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion | generating customized PDF documents]] stored in Google Drive [00:06:17].

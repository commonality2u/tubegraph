## Entering Payment Details

Users can input detailed payment information at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This includes:
*   The date of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Pay Rate Calculation
*   For hourly employees, users can specify the pay rate and the number of hours worked, and the payment amount will be calculated automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   For monthly employees, the pay rate is specified, and the hour column can be left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

The template also allows users to indicate whether a payment has been made by ticking or unticking a box, marking it as paid or unpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This feature is part of [[organizing_payroll_data | organizing payroll data]].

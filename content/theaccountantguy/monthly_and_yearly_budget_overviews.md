The monthly budget planner offers several views to help users understand their financial performance, providing a comprehensive look at expenses on a monthly, yearly, and summary basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These overviews are dynamically updated as expense transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Key Overview Sections

There are four primary views within the planner:
*   Expenses Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   Monthly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Yearly Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Summary of all booked expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

### Expenses Overview
This view presents a breakdown of expenses by category, such as shopping, entertainment, food, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For each category, it displays:
*   Total expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Percentage of total budgeted amount incurred as an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   A status indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or is under budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

### Monthly Overview
The monthly overview presents all recorded expenses in a monthly format, allowing users to see all expenses for a specific month at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Months are categorized, with later months appearing at the top in a descending format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This view helps in [[monthly_budget_tracking|monthly budget tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Yearly Overview
Similar to the monthly overview, the yearly overview presents the same expense information but organized in a yearly format, providing a broader perspective on spending trends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Summary Section
The summary section provides a complete expense overview in a yearly format, grouping all expenses together to give a consolidated picture of financial performance throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Understanding the Data
Data for these overviews is populated by entering transactions into the expense details database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Each entry includes:
*   Date (e.g., February 1, 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   Expense detail (e.g., Wi-Fi expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Period (month and year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>
*   Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   Category (e.g., utilities, food) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   Expense code (used to segregate expenses by category and month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   Expense amount (for actual expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>
*   Budget amount (set at the start of the month for specific expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>

[[managing_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses|Managing budgeted vs actual expenses]] is facilitated by separate columns for `expense amount` and `budget amount` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Setting a budget involves entering an expense with the same expense name and category name as the budget item, and putting the amount in the budget column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Interacting with Overviews
The planner allows for detailed exploration of financial data:
*   Clicking on a `period` (e.g., Feb 2024) opens a new window showing all transactions booked for that period, including whether they were actual expenses or budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   Clicking on a `year` provides a similar view, displaying budgeted amounts, expense amounts, expense as a percentage, budget status, and all transactions for the entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   Selecting a `category` reveals how much expense has been booked for that specific category, including budgeted amounts, expense percentages, and status, along with related transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   The `expense code` also allows viewing how much has been booked for a particular category of expense within a specific month, in comparison to the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

[[creating_a_sinking_funds_tracker_in_notion | Sinking funds]] are a method to save for specific future expenses over a period of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. They allow tracking of the overall savings needed, the amount saved, the remaining amount, and the percentage of contribution over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Types of Sinking Funds
Six specific types of [[creating_a_sinking_funds_tracker_in_notion | sinking funds]] are typically created within a Notion tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:
*   Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   Events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   Transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

For each of these [[creating_a_sinking_funds_tracker_in_notion | sinking funds]], the following details are tracked:
*   Goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   Amount saved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Amount left to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Contribution made over time (as a percentage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   Targeted date for contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   Required monthly contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

The tracker also shows the overall progress of each sinking fund, including monthly contributions and whether they meet the minimum criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Tracker Integration
These [[expense_categories_and_budget_management | categories]] are essential for structuring the [[creating_a_sinking_funds_tracker_in_notion | Notion sinking funds tracker]], which relies on five databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>:
1.  **Sinking Funds Database**: Holds all the details for each sinking fund, categorized by the types listed above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   Goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
    *   Starting balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
    *   Start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
    *   Goal date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
    *   Months (duration between start and end dates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
    *   Payment breakdown (required monthly payment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
    *   Account under which the fund is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
    *   Amount saved (rolled up from another database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
    *   Amount left (goal amount minus amount saved) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
2.  **Sinking Funds Details Database**: Stores information related to each sinking fund and its contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The first column identifies the sinking fund being contributed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, and a "category" property links different databases together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   Contribution date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
    *   Starting balance (closing balance of previous month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
    *   Contribution amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
    *   Closing balance (opening balance plus contribution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
    *   Contribution required per month (rolled over from Sinking Funds database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
3.  **Sinking Funds Overview Database**: Provides a summary of all [[creating_a_sinking_funds_tracker_in_notion | sinking funds]] created, showing goal amount, amount saved, amount left, targeted savings, contribution percentage, and goal date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
4.  **Sinking Fund Summary Database**: Indicates the targeted goal amount, amount saved, amount left, contribution percentage, targeted goal date, and required monthly contribution for each individual sinking fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
5.  **Total Sinking Funds Database**: Calculates the combined total values for all [[creating_a_sinking_funds_tracker_in_notion | sinking funds]], including targeted contribution, amount saved, amount left, and overall contribution percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

On the [[dashboard_and_summary_overview_of_sinking_funds | primary dashboard]], the [[sinking_funds_analysis | summary section]] linked to the Total Sinking Funds database displays the total goal amount, saved amount, amount left, and contribution percentage for all funds combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The "[[sinking_funds_analysis | Sinking Funds Overview]]" section, linked to the Sinking Fund Summary database, details the goal amount, saved amount, amount left, contribution percentage, end goal date, and required monthly contribution for each of the six types of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The "[[tracking_savings_and_contributions_for_sinking_funds | Sinking Funds Progress]]" section, linked to the Sinking Funds Details database, shows monthly payments and indicates with a green tick or red cross if contributions meet the minimum required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

A house rent payments tracker template can be utilized to [[tracking_house_rental_payments | keep track of house rental payments]] and provide a comprehensive overview of payment history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Summary Section

The tracker features a summary section with four distinct views:
*   **Basic Information** Tenants can be added and classified under different properties owned, such as apartments and duplexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Tenants can be added by clicking an "ADD tenant" button, which creates a new entry that can be moved under the appropriate category and detailed via a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Property Section** This view classifies properties and lists tenants under each. It displays key financial information for each tenant, including:
    *   Total rent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
    *   Rent amount that has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    *   Balance rent amount that is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    *   Advanced rent paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   **Rental History** This view displays the payment history for all tenants based on recorded transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Overall Summary** This section provides an aggregated overview, showing:
    *   Total amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
    *   Total amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
    *   Outstanding rent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
    *   Percentage of rent collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

## Transaction Section

The transaction section offers three distinct views in addition to a general view of all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>:
*   **Rent Paid** Shows all transactions where rent has been successfully paid, along with the respective tenants and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Rent Due** Displays information for rent that is due and has not yet been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Clicking a checkbox indicates payment, moving the transaction to the "Rent Paid" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This demonstrates [[using_transactions_to_track_rent_status | using transactions to track rent status]].
*   **Quarterly Summary** Provides a summary of rental payments, collections, and balance due for each month within a specific quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

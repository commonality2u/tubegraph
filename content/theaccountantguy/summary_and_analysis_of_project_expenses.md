This article describes a Notion template designed for [[summary_and_analysis_of_expenses_in_notion | tracking and analyzing business expenses]] related to construction projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It provides a quick and easy way to keep [[tracking_expenses | track of project expenses]] within a single template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template features:
*   **Expense Categories** Categories of expenses are defined at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses** Underneath each category, a budgeted expense amount and the actual expenses are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a detailed table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Values in this table can be modified, causing the expenses to update dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

*   **Editing Categories** Categories can be edited by clicking on a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, allowing users to define new categories for their specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Adding Categories** A new category can be added by clicking "new page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories** Categories can be deleted by clicking the three-dot menu and selecting delete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Defining Budgeted Expenses** New budgeted expense amounts can be defined by simply clicking on the existing budget value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Summary Section

The template includes a dedicated summary section that provides key financial insights:
*   **Total Budget Expense** Displays the total defined budget expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Expenses Incurred** Shows the total actual expenses, which are pulled from the detailed table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Difference** Calculates the difference between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Actual Expenses** Indicates the percentage of actual expenses incurred relative to the total budget so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

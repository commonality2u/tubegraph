[[generating_pdf_documents_for_sales_receipts | Generating PDF documents]] for business purposes, such as [[generating_pdfs_for_business_invoices | invoices]] or sales receipts, can be streamlined using tools like PDFoutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:38">[01:47:38]</a>. This platform allows users to create PDFs from selected templates, populating them with data from a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:57">[02:14:57]</a>.

## Single PDF Generation

Initially, users can select a specific template, such as an invoice template, from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>. Before [[generating_pdf_documents_for_sales_receipts | generating the PDF]], users can fill in specific details related to the document, such as currency, which can be changed at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. Once the details are entered, a single PDF document can be downloaded that precisely matches the filled information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:35">[02:50:35]</a>.

## Bulk PDF Generation from Database

For users needing to [[generating_bulk_pdfs_with_database_integration | export multiple PDF documents]] at once, a "bulk export mode" is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:23">[03:21:23]</a>.

### Workflow for Bulk Export

1.  **Access Bulk Export Mode**: Navigate to the "bulk export mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:23">[03:21:23]</a>.
2.  **Populate the Database**: Users can fill in a provided database interface with relevant details for multiple documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:23">[03:24:23]</a>. For invoices, this would include information like invoice number, invoice date, and other client/item specifics, mirroring the fields from the single PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:36">[04:01:36]</a>. Columns can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:17">[04:06:17]</a>.
3.  **Generate All PDFs**: Once the database is populated, clicking "download all PDF" will initiate the generation of PDF documents one by one, based on the information in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:06">[04:24:06]</a>. The generated bulk PDFs maintain the same format as individually generated ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:05">[04:35:05]</a>.
4.  **Individual Row Export**: Even in bulk mode, users have the option to download a PDF for any individual row by clicking a dedicated download button for that row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:36">[05:00:36]</a>.

### Database Integration

Currently, the platform supports a live database feature within its interface for [[working_with_databases_and_data_replacement_in_pdf_templates | mapping database elements to templates for PDF generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:59">[04:45:59]</a>.

#### Future Development
The platform plans to add a [[bulk_pdf_generation_from_notion_databases | Notion database feature]] in the future. This will allow users to add details to their Notion databases and then export corresponding documents from PDFoutput.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This will enable greater flexibility for users already [[using_notion_templates_and_databases_for_pdf_generation | managing templates and databases in PDFOutput]] for [[using_pdf_output_to_generate_invoices | generating invoices]] and other documents.

## Customization and Feedback

The platform aims to add more templates in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:15">[05:14:15]</a>. Users can submit requests for specific templates or provide feedback on desired features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:35">[05:16:35]</a>.

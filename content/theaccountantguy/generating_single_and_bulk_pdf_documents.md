[[using_pdfoutputcom_for_bulk_pdf_generation | PDFoutput.com]] offers a solution for creating PDF documents for businesses, supporting both single and [[bulk_pdf_document_creation | bulk PDF document creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Single PDF Document Generation

To generate a single PDF document:
1.  Navigate to [[using_pdfoutputcom_for_bulk_pdf_generation | PDFoutput.com]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
2.  Select a template from the dropdown menu, such as an invoice template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
3.  Choose your preferred currency from the available options, e.g., USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The currency can be changed later, and the invoice will populate with the new currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
4.  Fill in all the necessary details related to the document, such as invoice details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. As details are entered, they will populate the PDF in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
5.  Click "Download PDF" to generate and download the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The PDF will be ready in the same format as the filled-in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

This method is referred to as "single PDF mode," where details are filled in one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## [[bulk_pdf_document_creation | Bulk PDF Document Creation]]

For [[utilizing_pdf_output_for_bulk_pdf_generation | bulk PDF document creation]] and [[using_pdfoutput_for_bulk_document_generation | bulk document generation]], switch to "bulk export mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

1.  Click on the "bulk export mode" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
2.  Fill in the provided database with the required details for multiple documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This database includes fields such as invoice number, invoice date, and other relevant information, similar to the single PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Columns can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
3.  Once the database is filled, click "Download all PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The system will start [[exporting_and_managing_generated_pdf_documents | generating PDF documents]] one by one based on the information provided in each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
4.  Generated PDFs will maintain the same format as those created in single PDF mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Additionally, it is possible to export a PDF document for a specific row by clicking "Download PDF" next to that individual row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the system supports a live database feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. A future update will include a Notion database feature, allowing users to add details to their Notion database and export documents from [[using_pdfoutputcom_for_bulk_pdf_generation | PDFoutput.com]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This will enable [[generating_pdf_documents_in_bulk_with_notion | generating PDF documents in bulk with Notion]] via [[using_templates_to_create_pdf_documents_in_bulk | using templates to create PDF documents in bulk]].

This article explains how to [[setting_up_a_travel_expense_tracker_in_notion | utilize a travel expense tracker]] to [[tracking_expenses | keep track of all travel expenses]] and plan ahead, thereby helping in [[classifying_and_managing_income_and_expenses | classifying and managing income and expenses]] related to travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The system provides a summary section detailing accounts, expenses, and an overall summary of all expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This approach enables [[using_notion_for_detailed_travel_expense_management | detailed travel expense management]].

## Setting Up Expense Categories

The first step is to [[setting_up_expense_categories | set up different expense categories]] that will be incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Expenses are typically classified under broad categories such as "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

To add a new expense source (sub-category) within an existing category:
*   Click the "Add Expense Source" button, which automatically adds a new source to the travel category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Click the pencil icon to edit the details of this new expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, it can be named "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Set a budgeted amount for each expense source, e.g., $1,500 for "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   To move an expense source to a different category, click the three dots next to it and place it under the desired section, such as "Meals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

To create a new top-level category:
*   Click the plus sign on the right side of the screen to create an entirely new group, separate from "Travel," "Meals," and "Lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   Existing groups can also be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Any already added existing expense source can be edited by clicking its pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Each expense source has a budgeted amount set, providing a financial plan for expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This allows for [[customizing_categories_for_expense_tracking | customizing categories for expense tracking]].

## Tracking Expenses Overview

The "Expenses" section displays the total expenses incurred, the budgeted expense set for each category, and the percentage of actual spending against the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

*   **Over-budget:** If an expense exceeds the budgeted amount (e.g., $2,000 incurred for a flight with a $1,000 budget, showing 200%), it is indicated in red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Within-budget:** If an expense is within the budgeted amount (e.g., $100 incurred for breakfast with a $300 budget, showing 33%), it is indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

This provides a quick visual overview of where expenses stand for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, aiding in [[tracking_actual_vs_budgeted_travel_expenses | tracking actual vs budgeted travel expenses]].

## Overall Summary

The "Summary" section offers a complete overview of all travel expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>:
*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Total expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   The difference between the two amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   A percentage reflecting total expenses divided by the budgeted expenses (e.g., 59% means 59% of the budgeted expense has been reached) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Booking Expenses

To book new travel-related expenses, the system uses the same three categories: Travel, Meals, and Lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Steps to add an expense:
1.  Click on the relevant quick addition button, e.g., "Add Travel Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
2.  A new expense entry will be added with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
3.  Add a description for the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
4.  Enter "Trip Info," which describes the planned trip (e.g., "Trip to Paris") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This can be edited by clicking the three dots next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
5.  Select the specific "Account" or sub-category of the expense (e.g., for travel, choose "Bus," "Metro," "Train," or "Flight") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
6.  Input the amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, it updates the "Expenses" summary. For example, a $100 train expense will reflect under the "Train" account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. If a budgeted amount for "Train" was set to $200, the system would show that 50% of the budget has been incurred, displayed in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This system allows users to understand their current expense standing and plan future expenses effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

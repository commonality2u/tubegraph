This article explains how to utilize a business plan template in Notion to manage tasks and objectives for business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The template is presented by Anat Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Template Views

The business plan template offers two primary views for organization:
*   **Business Plan Roadmap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   **Events Timeline** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

## Business Plan Roadmap

The Business Plan Roadmap organizes the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Stages of Planning
The template provides 11 predefined stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:
*   Conceptual Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning and Structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   ...and continues up to Profitability and Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Users can customize these stages by clicking on the pencil icon to edit the business plan roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Defining Objectives and Completion
For each business plan, objectives can be defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Users can specify the stage to which a particular business plan corresponds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A completion percentage tracks progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Managing Tasks within Stages
Clicking on any stage reveals a detailed view displaying associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For example, "Conceptual Research" might have two specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Each task includes:
*   **Deadline**: The date by which the task should be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Completion Checkbox**: A checkbox to mark tasks as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Status**: Users can assign a status to tasks based on requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

New tasks can be added by clicking the "new" icon within a specific stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Additionally, a documentation section at the bottom allows for specifying objectives and tasks in detail for each stage of business planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Automatic Completion Updates
The completion percentage for a stage automatically updates when tasks are marked as complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion shows 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Completing both tasks updates it to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This percentage is visible at the top of the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Events Timeline

The Events Timeline provides a visual representation of all planned activities in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

This view displays:
*   Specific deadline dates for stages and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Stage names and associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Task dates and statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Arrows within the timeline reflect dates for all stages and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Clicking these arrows navigates to the specific date to view detailed information about stages and their associated properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

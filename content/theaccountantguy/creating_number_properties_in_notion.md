When working with numbers in Notion databases, it is necessary to assign them a "number property" type to enable calculations and other number-specific functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Database Setup

To illustrate, consider a database designed to calculate the product of two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This database includes:

*   **Operator Name (Title Property)**: The first property can be a title property, such as "multiply operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Number Properties**: Subsequent properties are dedicated to the numbers themselves. Each number must have a dedicated [[assigning_properties_to_numbers_in_notion | number property]] assigned to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. These numbers serve as inputs for formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

For example, if you input `2` and `3` into these number properties, they can be used to calculate their product, which would be `6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Utilizing Number Properties with Formulas

Once numbers have their respective properties, they can be used in [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] to perform operations like multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Notion supports different ways to express these calculations:

*   **Multiply Operator Formula**: Using a specific "multiply operator" formula within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Multiplication Symbol**: Simply placing the multiply symbol (`*`) between the two number properties in a formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Both methods allow you to calculate the product of the two numbers assigned their number properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This article details how to utilize a dedicated Notion template for tracking subscription expenses, as demonstrated by Sanat Biswal, also known as "the accountant guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This tracker allows users to quickly manage and monitor all their subscription costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Subscription Overview

The "Subscription Overview" section provides a quick glance at all subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
It categorizes subscriptions into two main views:
*   **Active Subscriptions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   **Cancelled Subscriptions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

Underneath each category, users can find the name of the subscription, the total expenses incurred for it, and its billing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The billing period can be easily changed by clicking on the relevant field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Expenses Section

The "Expenses" section further divides subscriptions into different user-defined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, such as infotainment, education, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Grouping**: Users can add new groups by clicking a plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> or edit existing groups by changing their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Details**: Each classification displays the subscription's name, total expenses, and its percentage contribution to the overall subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Quick Add**: A "quick action button" allows for the rapid addition of new subscriptions, which initially appear under a "not subscription" category and can then be moved to the desired classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Details can be edited using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction section" is where all subscription expense details are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Views**: It offers "active subscriptions" and "cancelled subscriptions" views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Monthly Breakdown**: Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top, and a total sum of expenses incurred for that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Data Entry**:
    *   **Status**: A checkbox marks a subscription as active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   **Subscription Account**: Users select the relevant subscription account, pulled from the top section of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
    *   **Billing Period**: This value is automatically pulled from the setting defined in the overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   **Payment Date**: A calendar allows selection of the payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: The expense amount is entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   **Renewal Date**: The renewal date is automatically calculated based on the billing period set (e.g., monthly, annual, weekly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, ensuring accuracy for different frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Cancellation**: Checking a box will automatically move a subscription to the "cancelled" status, which is reflected in the overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Quick Transaction Add**: A "plus subscription" button allows for quick addition of new transactions, which can then be detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

The house rent payments tracker template provides several views to monitor rental transactions and overall financial summaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Summary Section

At the top of the tracker, a summary section offers four different views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Property-Specific Details
Under the "Property" section, users can see different classifications of properties. For each property, the name of the tenant is displayed along with financial information:
*   Total rent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   Rent amount that has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   Balance rent amount that is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   Advanced rent that has been paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

### Rental History
The "Rental History" view provides a record of past rental payments made by all tenants, based on the transactions booked within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This contributes to a comprehensive [[tracking_rent_payments_and_history | tracking of rent payments and history]].

### Overall Financial Summary
A dedicated summary section presents a consolidated financial overview, including:
*   Total amount due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   Amount that has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Outstanding rent amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   Percentage of rent collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
This view aids in the [[summary_and_reporting_of_financial_transactions | summary and reporting of financial transactions]].

## Transaction Section
The "Transaction" section provides multiple views for managing and reviewing rental payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Rent Paid
This view displays all transactions for which rent has already been paid, showing the respective tenants and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Rent Due
Users can see information for rent that is due and has not yet been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Checking a box in this view will mark the rent as paid and move it to the "Rent Paid" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary
The "Quarterly Summary" view presents rental payments, collections, and the balance due for each month within a specific quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This provides a clear [[summary_and_quarterly_payment_analysis | summary and quarterly payment analysis]].

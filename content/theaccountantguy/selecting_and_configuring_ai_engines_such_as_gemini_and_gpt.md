To begin [[AI content generation using Wizzygen | generating AI-powered content]] on your Notion workspace using [[AI content generation using Wizzygen | Wizzygen]], you must first configure the AI engine settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These settings allow you to choose which AI model [[AI content generation using Wizzygen | Wizzygen]] will use for content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Accessing Settings

You can access the settings in two ways:
*   Click the gear icon on the home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Click "Settings" on the sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Once in the settings tab, you will define several configurations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## AI Engine Selection

After setting up the connections database (another required step), the next crucial step is selecting your AI engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. [[AI content generation using Wizzygen | Wizzygen]] offers a dropdown menu with different engines, including Gemini and GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Gemini
If you choose Gemini, you will need to define your Gemini API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### GPT
If you choose GPT, you will need to define your OpenAI API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## [[Generating and Using OpenAI API Keys | Obtaining API Keys]]

### Gemini API Key
To obtain a Gemini API key:
1.  Navigate to `AI studio.google.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
2.  Click on "Get API Key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
3.  You will be prompted to create a new API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
4.  Copy the generated key and paste it into the "AI API Key" field in [[AI content generation using Wizzygen | Wizzygen]] settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### OpenAI API Key
To obtain an OpenAI API key:
1.  Navigate to the OpenAI platform at `platform.openai.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
2.  Go to "API Keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  Click "Create new secret API key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
4.  Follow the prompts to generate your new secret key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
5.  Copy the generated key and paste it into the "AI API Key" field in [[AI content generation using Wizzygen | Wizzygen]] settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Cost Considerations

It is important to note the difference in access:
*   **Gemini** offers free access to its engines, though with certain usage limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **OpenAI** (GPT) requires a paid API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

If you are looking for a free engine to start testing, Gemini is a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Saving Settings

After defining your AI engine and API key, click "Save" to automatically store all your settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Local Storage
All the settings you enter are saved in your local storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This means the data is used by the [[AI content generation using Wizzygen | Wizzygen]] web app from your own system and is not stored on any external cloud, ensuring security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. You can also clear all defined local storage settings by clicking the "Clear" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

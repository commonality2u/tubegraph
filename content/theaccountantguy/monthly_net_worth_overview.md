The monthly net worth overview is a key component of a [[building_a_net_worth_tracker_using_notion | Notion]]-based [[Net worth tracking and financial goals | net worth tracker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It provides a concise summary of financial changes on a month-by-month basis, contributing to the overall [[tracking_savings_and_net_worth | tracking savings and net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Components

The monthly net worth overview specifies the following key figures for each month:
*   **Total assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   **Total liabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   **Net worth for the month** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **Change in net worth for the month** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

## Underlying Database

The data for the monthly net worth overview is derived from a dedicated "net worth database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This database performs the necessary calculations:

*   **Total Assets**
    *   Calculated based on the closing balance of assets for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Total Liabilities**
    *   Calculated based on the closing balance of liabilities for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Net Worth**
    *   Determined by deducting liabilities from assets for the specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Change in Net Worth**
    *   Calculated by deducting the opening net worth from the closing net worth of assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

All amounts used in these calculations are "rolled over" from the initial assets and liabilities database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Dashboard Integration

On the primary dashboard of the [[Personal Finance Tracker | net worth tracker]], the monthly net worth overview is presented by linking to the net worth database and setting it out in a gallery layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This provides an easily digestible visual representation of monthly financial performance.

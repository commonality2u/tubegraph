This article outlines how to use a personal finance tracker spreadsheet, featuring a dashboard for analysis of income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The spreadsheet provides a structured way to track financial details and gain insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Spreadsheet Overview

The personal finance tracker is organized into three main tabs:
*   **Dashboard Tab:** For analysis of income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Transactions Tab:** To record individual income and expense transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Budget Tab:** To feed in details about income and expense accounts and set budget estimations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Before using the spreadsheet, users should start with the "start here" tab for necessary instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Financial Accounts (Budget Tab)

The first step is to populate the **Budget Tab** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
Here, you will:
*   Feed in details related to your income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Specify budgeted amounts or income goals for each account for every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Categorize each account as either income or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   The "goal amount" column automatically totals the monthly entries for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This column is formula-driven, so new line items require dragging the formula down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   New rows can be easily added to the bottom of the tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Recording Financial Transactions (Transactions Tab)

After setting up accounts in the Budget Tab, you can add new transactions in the **Transactions Tab** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
For each transaction, you need to input:
*   The date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Details of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   The category (linking to the accounts specified in the Budget Tab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   The system automatically identifies if the transaction is an income or an expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This is a formula-driven property that should be dragged down for new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   The amount related to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

The data entered here feeds directly into the dashboard for [[summary_and_reporting_of_financial_transactions | summary and reporting of financial transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Analyzing Financial Data: The Dashboard Tab

The **Dashboard Tab** allows for a comprehensive [[dashboard_and_summary_overview_of_sinking_funds | dashboard and summary overview]] of all entered income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, providing a powerful way to analyze financial data.

### Interactive Controls for Analysis
All analysis on the dashboard is controlled by filters based on:
*   **Category:** To view specific income or expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Period:** To select a specific year or month for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Type of Reference:** To focus on "All" transactions, "Income" only, or "Expense" only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

For example, to see a summary of all income and expenses for the entire year 2023 across all accounts, you would filter accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Dashboard Sections and Insights
The dashboard presents several key sections for [[analyzing_expenses_by_type_and_period | analyzing expenses by type and period]] and income:

1.  **Summary Overview:** Displays total income, total expense amount, and the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
2.  **Income Overview:** Specifies different sources of income earned during the selected period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
3.  **Expenses Overview:** Provides a breakdown of expenses, similar to the income overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
4.  **Monthly Personal Finance Overview:** Shows income and expense details for each month, along with the net balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This feature supports [[using_dynamic_views_for_monthly_and_yearly_savings_tracking | using dynamic views for monthly and yearly savings tracking]].
5.  **Status Callout:** Indicates whether expenses have exceeded the budget or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Dynamic Filtering Examples
The dashboard dynamically updates based on filter selections:
*   Changing the category to "Income" will update the entire view to show only income details for the selected period and accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Further refining the category to a specific income source, like "Salary," will show only the financial details related to that specific source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

This powerful dashboard functionality allows for detailed [[using_google_sheets_for_finance_tracking | analysis of financial data using a spreadsheet tracker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

This article details how to utilize a business budget template in Notion to [[organizing_financial_transactions_in_notion | organize financial transactions]] and [[tracking_expenses_and_income_in_notion | track expenses]] for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Business Expenses Summary

The template includes a "Business Expenses Summary" at the top, which is divided into three primary sections: Account, Expenses, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Account Section

In the Account section, users can set up various categories or "heads" of expenses, such as Operational, Administration, or Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

*   **Adding New Categories**: To add a new expense category, scroll to the right and click the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Categories**: Existing categories can be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Budgeted Amount**: A budgeted amount can be specified for each head of expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. New accounts can also be added under existing categories with their budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Expenses Section

The Expenses section displays current expenses in comparison to the budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This section automatically updates as transactions are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

*   **Visual Indicators**:
    *   Expenses exceeding the budgeted amount are indicated in red, showing a high percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
    *   Expenses within the budgeted amount are indicated in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Summary Section

The Summary section provides an overview of the financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It reflects:

*   Total budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   The difference between the two totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   The percentage of the budgeted expense that has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

## Transaction Section

The transaction section, located at the bottom of the template, is where users [[entering_transactions_and_budgeting_in_notion | enter transactions]] and [[managing_accounts_and_transactions_in_notion | manage accounts]] to [[tracking_income_expenses_assets_and_liabilities_in_notion | track income, expenses, assets, and liabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Expenses are categorized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Adding New Expenses

There are several ways to [[entering_and_tracking_transactions_in_notion_budget_planner | enter and track transactions]]:

*   **Quick Buttons**: Buttons on the left side of the screen allow for quick expense entry under relevant categories. For example, clicking an "Operational expense" button will instantly add a new expense with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Adding Details**: After adding an expense, users can input a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, associate it with a relevant account from the top section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, and enter the desired amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Changing Dates**: If an expense was entered on the wrong date, the date can be easily changed by clicking on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Quick Add Button at Top**: A quick button at the top labeled "adding an expense source" allows for adding different expenses under each head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **"New" Button**: A general "New" button or icon can also be used to quickly add an expense under different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

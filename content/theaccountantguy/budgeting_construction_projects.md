Tracking business expenses for [[construction_project_expense_tracking | construction projects]] can be efficiently managed using a Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This template serves as a quick and easy way to [[tracking_budgeted_and_actual_expenses | keep track of construction project expenses]] in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Template Structure

The template is designed with distinct sections to facilitate clear oversight of project finances:

*   **Expense Categories** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>:
    *   Different categories of expenses are defined at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
    *   Each category includes a [[setting_and_managing_budgets_for_expenses | budgeted expense]] amount and the actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
    *   Actual expenses are dynamically pulled from a detailed table located at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
    *   Values can be modified in the table, and the expense figures at the top update dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Managing Categories

Categories can be managed directly within the template:

*   **Editing Categories**: Click on the pencil icon next to a category to edit its definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> and define a new category for your use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Adding Categories**: A new category can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories**: To remove a category, click on the three-dot menu and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Managing Budgeted Amounts

*   To set a new [[setting_and_managing_budgets_for_expenses | budgeted expense]] amount, simply click on the existing budget figure and define the new requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Summary Section

A dedicated summary section provides a comprehensive overview of the project's financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>:

*   **Total Budget Expense**: Displays the overall [[setting_budget_goals_and_tracking_progress | budget expense]] that was initially defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Expenses**: Shows the total actual expenses incurred, pulled from the bottom table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Difference**: Calculates the variance between the total budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Actual Expenses**: Indicates the proportion of the budget that has been utilized so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

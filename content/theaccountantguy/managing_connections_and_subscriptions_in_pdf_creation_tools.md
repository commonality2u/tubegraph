[[utilizing_pdf_output_for_document_generation|PDF output tools]], such as [[integration_with_pdf_output_com_for_document_generation|PDF output.com]], enable users to [[automating_pdf_document_generation|automate PDF document generation]] from Notion databases and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article focuses on how to manage established connections and handle subscriptions within these tools.

## Logging In and Initial Interface
To begin, users must log in to [[integration_with_pdf_output_com_for_document_generation|PDF output.com]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The interface displays fields for connection name, Notion database, and Notion template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Managing Connections
Once a [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents|PDF document]] has been generated, the tool creates and stores a "connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** Connections allow users to easily regenerate documents without needing to re-fill database and page information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Accessing Connections:** Connections can be found via the "connections" tab on the sidebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Utility:** Clicking on a saved connection automatically populates the database and template elements, allowing users to proceed directly to exporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Managing Subscriptions (Upgrades)
The tool offers different subscription plans that impact the generated [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents|PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Free Plan:** Templates generated under the free plan will include a watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Paid Plans:** Templates generated on any paid plan will not have a watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Upgrading:** Users can upgrade their subscription by clicking on the "upgrade" option in the sidebar and then activating the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This removes the watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## General Settings
The "settings" section allows users to configure various aspects of their [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents|PDF output]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Page Format:** Users can select their desired page format for the [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents|PDF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, such as A4 or Letter, and save this preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Adding Templates:** This section is where users connect templates that have been duplicated to their Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, ensuring they can be used for [[generating_pdf_documents_for_business_needs|document generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Support and Feedback
*   **Feedback Option:** If users encounter any issues with connections or other features, they can provide feedback by selecting their specific concern from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Help Section:** A dedicated "help" section provides a complete demonstration of the setup process in video format, serving as a quick troubleshooting guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

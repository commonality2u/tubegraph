This article provides an overview of a [[budgeting_and_tracking_expenses_in_Notion | budgeting and tracking expenses in Notion]] template, designed to fulfill various budgeting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It offers a comprehensive system for managing finances within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Core Components

The budgeting tracker template is built around five main components:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>

For each component, users can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For example, income has a "goal amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, and expenses have a "budget amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These amounts automatically update as transactions are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Key Metrics and Status

Each component displays:
*   **Percentage of Budget Incurred:** Shows how much of the budgeted amount has been spent or earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Budget Status:** Indicates whether spending has gone beyond the budgeted amount or remained within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Overview Sections

The template includes two main overview sections:

### Top Overview
This section provides an aggregate overview of all elements for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Using a dropdown menu, users can select a component (e.g., income, expense) to see detailed categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For income, it shows specific income amounts, goal amounts, and the total percentage of the goal achieved across all months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Monthly Overview
Located at the bottom of the template, this section provides a month-wise summary for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. It divides elements by month, allowing users to see specific budget and actual amounts for different categories within a given month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Entering Transactions

Users can input transactions using "quick buttons" located in a dedicated section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Clicking a button, such as "income," automatically adds a new entry to the transaction window with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Each transaction entry requires the following details:
*   **Detail:** A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Date:** The specific date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Month & Year:** The month and year of the transaction (can be typed in) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Category:** The specific category for the income or expense (e.g., salary, food, entertainment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Categories can be added or edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Code:** A specific code used to collate different elements across different months for specific sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount:** Set at the start of the month for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount:** The actual income or expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Customizing Currency
The currency for numerical values can be changed from dollar to any other currency by clicking on the number value, selecting "edit property," and then choosing the desired "number format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Filtering Capabilities

The template allows for dynamic filtering of data:
*   **Filter by Year:** Users can filter the entire template to view data for a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Filter by Month:** Data can also be filtered to show transactions for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This means viewing a specific month across all years or a specific month for a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Funds Balance

A "funds balance" section shows the income, spendings, and remaining balance for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This balance updates automatically as income and expense entries are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Spendings are derived from expenses, debt payments, bills, and savings, while income comes from income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

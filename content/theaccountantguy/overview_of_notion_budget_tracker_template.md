This Notion budgeting tracker template is designed to help fulfill diverse budgeting requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It provides a comprehensive [[overview_of_notion_expense_tracker | overview]] of its features upon download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Core Components

The budgeting tracker is built around five main components:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

## Budgeting Mechanics

For each component, you can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>:
*   **Income**: Set a goal amount for each income component per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Expense**: Set a budget amount; this automatically updates as expenses are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The template also tracks:
*   **Percentage of Budget**: Shows how much of the budgeted amount has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Budget Status**: Indicates whether spending is beyond or within the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Detailed Overviews (Left Panel)

An [[notion_expense_tracker_overview | overview]] section on the left side of the screen provides detailed insights for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Clicking a drop-down (e.g., "income [[notion_expense_tracker_overview | overview]]") reveals all added income categories, specific income amounts, goal amounts, and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Similarly, for expenses, it shows targeted amounts and actual incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Users can add as many categories as they wish for each component, and the display will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Transaction Input

Transactions are entered in a dedicated section with "quick buttons" for each component (e.g., "Income," "Expense") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Clicking a button automatically adds a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Required details for each entry include:
    *   **Detail**: A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   **Date**: The specific date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   **Month & Year**: Users can type in months and years (e.g., "Jan 2024") to categorize entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   **Category**: A specific category for the income or expense (e.g., "Salary," "Food," "Entertainment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. These categories are editable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   **Code**: A unique code derived from the category, month, and year (e.g., "Side Asal Jan 2024") to track specific sources across months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   **Budget Amount**: Set at the beginning of the month for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **Actual Amount**: The actual income or expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Monthly Summary

Below the transaction input, an exact same summary is provided as at the top, but with a month-wise division for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. For example, expense categories like "Food," "Entertainment," and "Shopping" are displayed under their respective months (e.g., Jan 2024, Feb 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. As new entries are added for different months, they automatically appear in this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Currency Customization
The default currency is USD, but it can be changed to any other currency by clicking on the number values, selecting "Edit Property," and then "Number Format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Dynamic Filtering

The template allows for dynamic filtering of data:
*   **By Year**: Users can filter the entire dataset for a particular year (e.g., 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **By Month**: Users can filter for a specific month across all years or for a specific month within a specific year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Funds Balance

A "Funds Balance" section provides a quick glance at your financial standing at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   It displays the total income and total spendings for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   It calculates and shows the remaining balance amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   Spendings combine expenses, debt payments, bills, and savings, while income comes from income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   This section can also be filtered dynamically by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

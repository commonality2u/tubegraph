The Employee Paycheck Tracker is a simple template designed to [[managing_customer_database_and_payments | keep track of all employee payments]] in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It organizes information into three main sections: Records, Payments, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Template Sections

*   **Records**: This section contains detailed information about each employee, including their status (e.g., permanent), payments due, number of months of payment due, how they are paid (monthly or hourly), and the payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It serves as a complete record of all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Payments**: This section displays the total paycheck due, the amount already paid, the balance outstanding, and any advance payments made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Summary**: The summary section provides an overview, showing the total paycheck due, the amount paid, the outstanding balance, and the percentage of the total paycheck that is due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Managing Employee Records

The template allows for easy management of employee data:
*   **Adding Employees**: New employees can be added by clicking the "new" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Adding Categories**: New categories can be added using the "plus" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Editing Departments**: Existing employee departments can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## [[adding_and_managing_transactions | Adding and Managing Transactions]]

The payment details can be entered by scrolling down to the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Entering Payment Information
*   **Date**: Input the date of the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Period**: Specify the period for which the payment is being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Description**: Add a description of the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Employee Selection**: Select the specific employee for whom the payment is being recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### [[utilizing_payment_frequency_and_transaction_types | Payment Methods and Calculations]]
The template accommodates different payment frequencies and automatically calculates payment amounts:
*   **Hourly Basis**: If an employee is paid hourly, specify the pay rate and the number of hours worked. The template will automatically calculate the payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Monthly Basis**: If an employee is paid monthly, specify the monthly pay rate and leave the hour column blank. This indicates that the employee is paid on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Payment Status
A column indicates whether a payment has been made or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. If a payment is due but not yet paid, simply untick the box to mark it as unpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Quarterly Analysis
The template also includes a quarterly section that shows the total paycheck due, the amount paid, and the net balance for every quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This payment data is further divided into "permanent" and "contractual" categories based on the employee's record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

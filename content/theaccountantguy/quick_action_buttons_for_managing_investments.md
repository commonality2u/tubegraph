Quick action buttons are a feature within the Investment Portfolio Tracker that streamline the process of managing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These buttons are readily available in the portfolio section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> and the transactions section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, enabling users to quickly add new investments or record transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Adding New Investments

The "Add Investment" quick action button facilitates the rapid creation of new investment entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

*   **Functionality**: Clicking this button instantly adds a new investment entry to the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Details Panel**: After adding, a pencil icon appears next to the new entry. Clicking this icon opens a panel where specific investment details can be input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Required Information**: Users can enter the investment name (e.g., "X investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, its opening balance (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, and opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Categorization**: Investments can be classified under existing categories like stocks or cryptos. Users can also [[organizing_investments_into_categories | add new categories]], such as "Bonds," by clicking the plus icon and creating a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Once categorized, the investment will be automatically placed under that specific group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Recording Investment Purchases

The "Buy Investment" quick action button is designed for efficiently logging new investment purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

*   **Functionality**: When clicked, this button automatically adds a new line item under the "Buy" view within the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Automatic Date**: The system automatically populates the entry with the current date when the button is clicked, though this can be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Details Entry**: Users can then fill in details such as the date, description, type of transaction, the specific investment account (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin), the number of units purchased, and the buy price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The buy amount is automatically calculated based on units and price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Recording Investment Sales

Similar to purchases, the "Sell Investment" quick action button facilitates the recording of investment sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

*   **Functionality**: Clicking this button creates a new line item directly under the "Sell" view in the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Details Entry**: Users can then input relevant information for the sale, including the date, description, investment account, units sold, and selling price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Profit/Loss Tracking**: The system will use this data, along with the corresponding buy information, to reflect the profit or loss generated from the transaction in the profit and loss section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

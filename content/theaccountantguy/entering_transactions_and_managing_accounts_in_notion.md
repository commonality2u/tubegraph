This Notion template functions as a [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | business expense tracker]], designed to help businesses keep track of all their [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | business expenses]] under a single general ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Expense Categories

The tracker allows users to define various [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | expense categories]] that a business might incur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
Predefined [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | business expense]] heads are provided, which can be modified by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Subcategories can be edited by clicking the pencil icon next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. New categories can also be added by clicking "new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

For each category, users can set a [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | budgeted amount of expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This budgeted amount will automatically reflect in the expenses overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, changing the budget for "advertising" from $100 to $5,000 will update the expenses overview accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Expenses Overview

The [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | expenses overview]] section provides a summary of:
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   Budgeted expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   A percentage indicating whether the budget has been exceeded or if the expenses are still within budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

## Entering Transactions

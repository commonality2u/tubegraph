For businesses looking to [[generating_pdfs_for_business_invoices | generate PDF documents]] quickly and efficiently, a specialized tool like PDFoutput.com offers solutions for both single and [[bulk_exporting_pdf_documents | bulk PDF generation]] of invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>.

## Single Invoice Generation and Customization

Upon logging into PDFoutput.com, users are presented with an interface that allows them to select a specific template from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:78">[01:59:78]</a>. The invoice template is a primary option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:53">[02:03:53]</a>.

Key [[customizing_invoice_layout_and_settings | customization features]] include:
*   **Currency Selection:** Users can choose their preferred currency, with various options available, such as the US dollar or Euro, which will dynamically populate the invoice with the selected currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:18">[02:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:18">[02:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:78">[03:04:78]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.
*   **Detail Population:** Users fill in relevant invoice details, and the PDF document is automatically populated with the corresponding information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:18">[02:19:18]</a>.
*   **PDF Download:** After filling in the details, a single click on "Download PDF" generates the complete PDF document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:38">[02:50:38]</a>. The generated invoice precisely matches the filled-in details and selected currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:08">[02:57:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:58">[03:11:58]</a>.

## Bulk Invoice Exporting and Customization

For businesses needing to [[customizing_invoice_templates_for_bulk_generation | generate multiple invoices]], PDFoutput.com supports a [[bulk_exporting_pdf_documents | bulk export mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:58">[03:20:58]</a>.

Steps for [[bulk_exporting_pdf_documents | bulk generation]]:
1.  **Switch to Bulk Export Mode:** Click on the "bulk export mode" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:28">[03:22:28]</a>.
2.  **Fill Database:** Input invoice details into a structured database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:08">[03:24:08]</a>. This database contains fields similar to the single PDF mode, such as invoice number and date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:08">[04:02:08]</a>. Columns can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:58">[04:06:58]</a>.
3.  **Generate Bulk PDFs:** Once the database is filled, click "Download all PDF" to initiate the generation of multiple PDF documents based on the entered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:68">[04:23:68]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:08">[04:26:08]</a>. Each generated PDF will maintain the format and chosen currency from the settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:68">[04:34:68]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:48">[04:40:48]</a>.

The platform also allows for individual PDF exports from the bulk database by clicking "Download PDF" for a specific row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:28">[05:00:28]</a>.

### Future Enhancements
The platform currently supports a live database feature and will soon add a Notion database integration, allowing users to export documents directly from their Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:28">[04:46:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:68">[04:48:68]</a>. Users can also request specific templates or provide feedback for future additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:08">[05:14:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:48">[05:21:48]</a>.

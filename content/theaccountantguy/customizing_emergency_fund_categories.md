When setting up and tracking emergency funds, the template provides a flexible system for defining and modifying fund categories to suit individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This customization ensures that the [[emergency_funds_setup_using_notion | emergency funds setup]] aligns with personal financial goals and priorities.

## Default Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
Upon initial setup, the template includes three default categories for emergency funds:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

## How to Customize Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
Users can modify these default categories or add new ones based on their preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Editing Existing Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
To edit an existing category:
1.  Navigate to the "Fund Setup" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  Click on the category you wish to edit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
3.  Define your desired new category name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Adding New Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
To add a completely new category (or group):
1.  Navigate to the "Fund Setup" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  Click on the "Add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
3.  The system will prompt you to add a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Assigning Funds to Categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
When a new fund is added, it initially appears under a "No classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. To assign it to a category:
1.  Click on the three-dot icon next to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
2.  Move it to the desired category, such as "Financial Safety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

This customization capability allows users to tailor the [[tracking_emergency_fund_savings | emergency fund tracking]] system to their specific financial planning needs, similar to [[customizing_budget_categories_and_currency | customizing budget categories]] or [[customizing_expense_categories_in_notion | expense categories]].

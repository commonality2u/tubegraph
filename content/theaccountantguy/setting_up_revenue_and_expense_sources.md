This template helps users track tax payments by clearly defining and managing [[setting_up_accounts_in_notion_for_cash_flow | accounts]] for revenue and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Accounts Section

The "Accounts" section is fundamental for setting up all your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Revenue Sources**
    Revenue sources are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples provided include "services" and "goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources**
    Expense sources are where input tax credit is availed to set off against tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example provided is "purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Adding Revenue and Expense Sources

Users can easily add new revenue or expense sources using the [[using_quick_action_buttons_and_expense_sources | quick action button]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

*   Clicking "Add Revenue Source" automatically adds a new revenue account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Clicking "Add Expense Source" automatically adds a new expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The pencil icon can be used to feed in details for the new revenue or expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Summary Reflection

Once revenue and expense sources are added, the "Accounts" section automatically updates to indicate the number of each type of source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For example, "two" might indicate two revenue sources and "one" might indicate one expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Financial Sections and Tracking

The "Financials" section allows users to [[income_and_expense_tracking_features | track]] all revenue and expense amounts, along with the corresponding tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

*   Total revenues earned from services and goods, along with their tax liabilities, are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Input taxes from purchases are also reflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Figures in this section are automatically updated based on transactions entered in the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Using Sources in Transactions

After setting up revenue and expense sources, users can utilize them in the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

*   When [[adding_and_managing_expenses | adding]] a new revenue transaction, users can select the relevant account (e.g., "Goods") from the list of previously added revenue sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Similarly, when [[adding_and_managing_expenses | adding]] an expense, users can select the relevant account (e.g., "Purchases") from the list of expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   This selection links the transaction to the appropriate source, allowing for accurate tax calculations and overall financial tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

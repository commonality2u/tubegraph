## Purpose of Revenue and Expense Sources

*   **Revenue Sources**: These are the sources from which you incur tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources**: These are where you can avail input tax credit to offset against your tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## How to Set Up Revenue and Expense Sources

The template comes with pre-added examples: "Services" and "Goods" as revenue sources, and "Purchases" as an expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

To add new revenue or expense sources:
1.  Utilize the "quick action button" located on the left side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  Clicking "Add Revenue Source" will automatically create a new revenue account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
3.  Clicking "Add Expense Source" will automatically create a new expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
4.  Once created, you can use the "pencil icon" to input specific details for the new revenue or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

As you add more sources, the summary section automatically updates to reflect the total number of revenue and expense sources you have set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This setup is crucial for [[classifying_and_managing_income_and_expenses | classifying and managing income and expenses]] within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

These defined sources are then available for selection when entering individual transactions, allowing the system to accurately track total revenue, expenses, and associated tax liabilities or input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, contributing to overall [[tracking_income_expenses_and_cash_flow_movements | tax payments]] management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

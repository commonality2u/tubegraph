## Setting up Revenue and Expense Sources

The tax payment tracker template helps users track all tax payments, including quarterly tax payments and overall tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. A key component of this system is the initial setup of revenue and expense sources.

### Accounts Section Overview

The "Accounts" section is where users [[managing_accounts_expenses_and_liabilities | set up]] all their revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This section is displayed as part of the tax payment summary at the top of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Defining Revenue Sources

Revenue sources are the channels through which tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples provided include "services" and "goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Defining Expense Sources

Expense sources are where input tax credit can be availed to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example provided is "purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Adding and Modifying Sources

Users can add new revenue or expense sources using the "quick action button" on the left side of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Clicking "Add Revenue Source" automatically adds a new revenue account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Clicking "Add Expense Source" automatically adds a new expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Once a new account is added, users can utilize a "pencil icon" to input the specific details for that revenue or expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Summary Reflection

The Accounts section provides a count of the set-up sources, indicating the number of revenue sources and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This count automatically updates as more sources are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Integration with Financials and Transactions

Once revenue and expense sources are established, their details are used in the "Financials" section to track total revenue and expense amounts, along with tax liabilities and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. These sources also serve as categories for individual transactions recorded in the "Transaction section" at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

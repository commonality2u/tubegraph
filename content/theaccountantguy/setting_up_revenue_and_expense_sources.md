Sanat Biswal, also known as The Accountant Guy, demonstrates how to utilize a template to track tax payments, beginning with setting up [[setting_up_accounts_and_classifications | accounts]] for revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Understanding Revenue and Expense Sources

The "Accounts" section is dedicated to setting up all your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Revenue sources** are the areas where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Expense sources** are where you can avail input tax credit to offset tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The template comes pre-configured with "Services" and "Goods" as revenue sources and "Purchases" as an expense source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Adding New Sources

To add a new revenue or expense source, you can use the "quick action button" located on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Clicking "Add Revenue Source" will automatically create a new revenue account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Clicking "Add Expense Source" will automatically create a new expense account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Once an account is added, use the pencil icon to input specific details for your revenue or expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Summary Updates
After adding revenue and expense sources, the system displays the total count of each (e.g., "two" for revenue sources and "one" for expense sources) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This count automatically updates as more sources are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

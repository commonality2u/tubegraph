For businesses looking to [[creating_pdf_documents_for_business_needs | create PDF documents]] efficiently, a solution like PDF Output (available at PDFoutput.com) can be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This service is designed to help businesses [[exporting_and_managing_pdf_documents_for_business | manage and generate PDF documents]] for various needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## PDFOutput.com Interface and Features
Upon logging into PDFOutput.com, users are presented with an interface that allows for template selection and currency configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Template Selection
Users can select a specific template from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For instance, an "invoice" template is available for [[generating_pdf_invoices_using_pdf_output_service | creating invoices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Currency Options
The platform supports various currency options, such as the US dollar, which can be selected to populate the document correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Users can choose their preferred currency from several available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Document Generation Modes

#### Single PDF Mode
In this mode, users manually fill in all the necessary details related to the document, such as an invoice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. As details are entered, the PDF is populated in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Once the details are complete, clicking "Download PDF" automatically generates the PDF document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The generated PDF will reflect all the entered information and selected currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The currency can be changed, and a new PDF downloaded to reflect the update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

#### Bulk Export Mode
For generating multiple PDF documents, the bulk export mode is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This mode allows users to input data into a database within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Once the database is filled with information for multiple documents (e.g., invoices), users can [[bulk_pdf_document_generation | generate PDF documents in bulk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

The database includes fields similar to those in the single PDF mode, such as invoice number and date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Columns can be expanded for better visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. After entering all required details across multiple rows, clicking "Download all PDF" will generate each PDF document one by one, based on the information provided in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The generated bulk PDFs will maintain the same format and chosen currency as individual PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Future Developments
The platform currently supports a live database feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Future updates aim to include a Notion database integration, allowing users to export documents directly from their Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. New templates will also be added based on user requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Support and Feedback
Users can submit requests for specific templates or provide general feedback through available links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

The Sales Performance OS template allows users to track and analyze sales performance across various sales channels, providing insights into where sales originate and how effectively each channel performs against set targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Understanding Sales Channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
A sales channel represents the different sources through which sales are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The template categorizes sales by channels such as:
*   Website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

Users can also add their own custom categories for sales channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Tracking Sales Channel Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
For each sales channel, the template tracks performance based on monthly data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Key metrics include:
*   **Sales Achieved:** The total sales generated by the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Targeted Sales:** The sales goal set for the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Sales:** The percentage of the targeted sales that was achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Status:** Indicates whether the target was met ("Target achieved") or not ("Target not achieved") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Sales Channel Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
A dedicated overview section provides an aggregated summary for each sales channel, displaying:
*   Total sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   Sale units (how many units were sold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Average sales (sales per unit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>

This overview helps in tracking and getting a broad picture of what is happening in the business throughout different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Data Entry and Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>
To manage and track sales channels, users can:
*   **Set Targets:** At the beginning of each month, users can set targeted sales for each individual sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This can be done automatically using a "quick action" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Enter Sales Information:** As sales occur, users feed in details for each transaction, including the sales channel information, a unique referral code for the channel, the month, and the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Account Details:** Account details need to be fed for each sales channel as they appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Customization:** The template allows for [[customizing_templates_and_calculating_sales_data | customization]] of various elements, including currency symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Filtering and Reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>
The data within the [[sales_dashboard_components | sales dashboard]] can be filtered to provide specific views:
*   **By Year:** Users can add a filter to view performance for a particular year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **By Month:** Filters can also be applied to see data for specific months or combinations of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

These filtration capabilities help users see more detailed performance of their sales efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

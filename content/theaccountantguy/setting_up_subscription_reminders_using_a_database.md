Sanat Biswal, known as The Accountant Guide, demonstrates how to receive subscription payment reminders directly on WhatsApp using a database system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This process involves setting up reminders through a database to ensure timely notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Setting up Automated Subscription Reminders

To set up an automated subscription payment reminder:

1.  **Create a New Template**
    *   Click on the drop-down menu within the database interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
    *   Select the option to create a new template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
    *   Choose the "subscription reminder alert" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  **Specify Subscription Details**
    *   Enter the name of the subscription, e.g., "Spotify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
    *   Specify the subscription amount, e.g., $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    *   Click "background" (or the equivalent confirmation button) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A new template will be added to the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
3.  **Configure Repetition**
    *   Click on the three dots next to the newly added template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   Click on "repeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   Select the desired repetition mode, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This ensures the reminder repeats monthly for the specified amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
4.  **Set Time and Date**
    *   A new window will open where you can specify the exact time and date for the reminder to start and repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   Set the desired time, for example, 11:56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
    *   Confirm that it should repeat "every month" on a specific day, like the 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. A repetition arrow will appear, indicating the reminder is set to automatically repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Receiving WhatsApp Notifications

Once the reminder is set, the system will automatically add a new line item to the database at the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Following this, a notification alert will be automatically received on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The WhatsApp notification will inform you about the payment reminder, specifying the amount and subscription name, e.g., "$150 for Spotify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The message also includes a "Pay now" link, allowing direct payment through the provided link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This helps in ensuring [[automating_subscription_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | subscription payment reminders on WhatsApp]] are paid on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Customization

The reminder alert received on WhatsApp is fully customizable to meet individual requirements, meaning there is no fixed template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Instructions and guides are available for users to set up this automation independently after downloading the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

This article details the customization options available within a [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | Film Production Budget Tracker]], designed to manage film production expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Film Production Budget Tracker Overview

The template includes a table that lists all expenses individually, along with their respective categories and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Customizing Expenses and Categories

The template offers several customization features for managing your budget:
*   **Defining Categories** You can define or update your own expense categories by clicking a pencil icon next to the existing category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These updates are reflected across the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Updating Budgeted Expenses** The budgeted expense value can be updated directly within the template, with all related values updating automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Entering Expense Amounts** Actual expense amounts can be entered on the expense side, and these entries also update the system bi-directionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Managing Categories**
    *   New categories can be added by clicking on the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   Existing categories can be edited via the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   Categories can be deleted by clicking on the three-dot menu and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Summary and Reporting

A dedicated summary section provides a concise overview of financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This includes:
*   Budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   The percentage of expenses relative to the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>

This summary helps in comparing current spending against the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

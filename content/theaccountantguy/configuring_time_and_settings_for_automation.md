This article outlines how to configure essential settings and scheduling for an automation workflow, specifically focusing on time zones and daily triggers in Pabbly Connect for [[automation_setup_using_notion_and_gmail | Notion]]-based invoice reminders.

## Enabling the Automation Workflow

Before diving into specific settings, ensure your automation workflow is activated. This makes the entire setup functional when configured correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

> To enable the workflow:
> 1.  Navigate back to your Pabbly Connect dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
> 2.  Click the "on" button next to your specific automation workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
> 3.  An "active" status indicates the automation is ready to run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Setting Your Time Zone

The first crucial step in setting up the automation is configuring the correct time zone in your Pabbly Connect dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This ensures that all scheduled actions happen at the desired local time.

> 1.  Go to the "settings" panel in your Pabbly Connect dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
> 2.  Locate the "time zone" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
> 3.  Click on the time zone and select your particular requirement from the drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. For example, it can be set to 5 hours 30 minutes GMT time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
> 4.  After selecting, click "Save" to apply the time zone settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The system will reflect timings based on this local time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Scheduling Daily Automation Triggers

The automation can be set to trigger on a daily basis, checking your [[automation_setup_using_notion_and_gmail | Notion]] database for invoices that are "due" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

> 1.  Within your workflow, find the "Schedule by Pabbly" trigger, which is provided by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
> 2.  Click on the drop-down menu to select the frequency. Options include regular intervals, once, particular days of the week, or particular dates of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. For invoice reminders, "Every Day" is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
> 3.  Set the specific time for the automation to run daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. For example, you can set it to 10:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> or 2:00 PM (14:00 in 24-hour format) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
> 4.  Click "Save" to confirm the daily schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The automation will then trigger every day at the set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

NotionBooks Freelancers OS is a dashboard designed to help freelancers track their income, expense details, and overall finances, in addition to providing client management capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Finance Section Overview

The system includes a dedicated finance section where users can manage their financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This section allows for [[managing_income_sources_in_notion | managing income sources]] and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Initial Setup & Guidance
Upon downloading the setup, users land on a dashboard with quick instructions, including how to change the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. A video demonstration explains currency changes and provides a quick tutorial on how to use the finance setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. If users are unfamiliar with the finance system, a video tutorial is available to explain its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Recording Income
Any client-related income can be added and classified as "client" within the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Users can also create their own classifications for income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
To add new income:
1.  Click "new income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
2.  Specify an income name, e.g., "client income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
3.  Select "client" for classification or type a new classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
Income classified under "client" will automatically appear in the client section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. All income transactions classified under "client" will reflect in the client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Client Section & Financial Integration

The client section is a separate dashboard for [[client_management_strategies_in_notion_for_freelancers | client management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It includes four main areas: invoicing details, client details, project details, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Client Details & Financial Tracking
Clients are organized into pipelines: leads, negotiation, and current clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. For each client, the system reflects:
*   **Invoice Amount:** This amount is pulled from the invoicing information fed into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Contract Value:** Users manually input the contract value for a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Invoiced Percentage:** The system automatically updates the percentage of the contract value that has been invoiced, based on the invoice amounts received over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. For example, if a client has a $12,000 contract value and $2,000 has been invoiced, it shows 17% of the work has been invoiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
Each client's entry also displays details like company, contact, email, position, stage, and website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. All work-related details, including booked incomes and their invoice status, are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Project Details & Financial Calculation
Projects represent the work performed to fulfill a work order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Projects can be tracked under different priorities: low, medium, and high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
When adding a project, users specify its name, value, and completion date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
Project completion percentage can be calculated in two ways:
*   **By Hours:** If estimated hours for completion are specified, the completion is calculated based on the actual hours booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. For example, if a project is estimated for 10 hours and 7 actual hours are booked, it shows 70% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **By Invoicing:** If total project value is specified, completion is calculated based on the invoice amounts assigned to that project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. For instance, if a project has a $6,000 value and $3,000 has been invoiced, it shows 50% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### Services Details & Pricing
Services are linked to projects and clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Services can be categorized by status: not started, in progress, or completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
When adding a service, users define its name and pricing method, which can be hourly or a fixed flat rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. A service rate (e.g., $10 per hour for hourly, or $2,000 for a fixed fee) is also set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Each service entry shows the client and project it's associated with, and the total service value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

### Invoicing Section
The invoicing section tracks invoices by status: draft, sent, and paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. It displays the total invoice amount for each category and allows users to count the number of invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

To add a new invoice:
1.  Select a category (e.g., "sent") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
2.  Input the invoice number (e.g., "invoice 0003") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
3.  Specify a due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

### Workflow Integration
The "Workflow" section at the bottom of the client dashboard displays all client-assigned incomes from the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This is where users link income records to specific invoices, clients, projects, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

When an invoice is added to an income record in the workflow, the invoice amount automatically reflects in the invoicing section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Similarly, assigning a client, project, or service to an income record in the workflow automatically updates the respective sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

**Payment Mode:** The workflow also tracks the payment mode for each income. If an invoice is unpaid (e.g., "draft" or "sent" status), the payment mode can be removed. Once payment is received, "Bank" can be selected as the payment mode, which updates calculations in the finance view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. This contributes to [[organizing_financial_transactions_in_notion | organizing financial transactions in Notion]].

## Additional Tools

Beyond financial and client management, the system includes tools to support various business aspects:

*   **Resources:** A section for organizing useful resources into categories like checklists, guides, strategies, or tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Users can add notes and links to each resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. This can be used for [[managing_business_expenses_in_notion | managing business expenses]] or even [[business_budget_template_setup_in_notion | business budget template setup in Notion]].
*   **Contacts:** A contact catalog for people regularly interacted with, categorized by service type (e.g., finance, legal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   **Goals:** Users can set personal or business goals, categorized under headings like health, wealth, and relationship. Goal progress is calculated based on target and achieved values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. This assists in aspects of [[using_notion_for_personal_finance | personal finance]] or [[budgeting_and_saving_with_notion | budgeting and saving]].
*   **Calendar:** A calendar view to display all scheduled meetings for the month, allowing for quick overviews of business engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. Meetings can be assigned to clients or contacts, include agendas, and specify meeting mediums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

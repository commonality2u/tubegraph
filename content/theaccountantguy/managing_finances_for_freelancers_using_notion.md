[[client_management_with_notion_for_freelancers | Notion Books Freelancers OS]] is a comprehensive dashboard designed for freelancers to manage their entire business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It allows freelancers to track all income and expense details, manage their finances, and offers a dashboard for client management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Getting Started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
Upon downloading the setup, users land on a page with quick instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This includes guidance on how to change the currency within the dashboard, often accompanied by a video demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A quick tutorial is also available for using the finance setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The dashboard has two primary navigation windows: "Finance" and "Client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Users can navigate between these sections using a navigation bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## [[managing_finances_with_notion | Finance Management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
The Finance section allows freelancers to track their financial details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. A dedicated video tutorial is available for users unfamiliar with how to use the entire finance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Tracking Income and Expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
Freelancers can book any income, especially client income, and classify it as "Client" or create their own classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Adding New Income**: To add new income, click "New Income," specify the income name (e.g., "client income"), and select or create a classification like "Client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Reflection in Client Portal**: All income transactions booked and classified under "Client" will reflect in the Client portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This ensures only client-related income, not salary or other non-client income, is displayed in the client section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## [[client_management_with_notion_for_freelancers | Client Management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>
The Client section of the dashboard includes four main areas: Invoicing Details, Client Details, Project Details, and Services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. It also features sections for Resources, Contacts, Goals, and a Calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Client Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
Clients are categorized into a pipeline with three stages: "Lead," "Negotiation," and "Client" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Adding Clients**: New clients can be added by clicking the "New" option under any category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Users specify the client name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Client Information**:
    *   **Invoice Amount**: Automatically reflects the total invoice amount raised against a client, pulled from the invoicing section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   **Contract Value**: This is manually entered by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The system then calculates the percentage of the contract value that has been invoiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
    *   **Detailed View**: Clicking on a client opens a new window with additional details like company, contact, email, position, stage, and website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. It also shows work-related details, including booked incomes, invoice numbers, and their status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Moving Clients**: Clients can be easily dragged and dropped between different pipeline categories (Lead, Negotiation, Client) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Project Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>
Projects track the work performed to fulfill a work order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Projects are categorized by priority: Low, Medium, and High <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Adding Projects**: Click "New" under the desired priority to add a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Specify the project name, project value, and a completion date (which can be a single date or a date range) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Project Status**: Update the project's status (e.g., "Not Started," "In Progress") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Project Completion**: The completion percentage can be calculated in two ways:
    *   **Hourly Basis**: Specify estimated total hours for the project and then input actual hours completed to get a percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
    *   **Invoicing Basis**: Based on the proportion of the total project value that has been invoiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. For example, if a project is valued at $6,000 and $3,000 has been invoiced, it shows 50% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### Services Section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>

*   **Adding Services**: Click "New" to add a service, specify the service name, and add a service pricing method (e.g., hourly basis or fixed flat rate fees) and rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Service Details**: Details include service duration, rate, pricing, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

    *   **Linking Invoices**: In the workflow, an invoice can be linked to a specific income entry. This automatically updates the invoice amount in the invoicing section above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
    *   **Linking Clients, Projects, Services**: Users can then assign the corresponding client, project, and service to that income entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. As these details are filled in, the information automatically feeds into the respective client, project, and service sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
    *   **Adding On The Fly**: It's possible to create new invoices, clients, projects, or services directly from the workflow section, which then get added to their respective top-level sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
    *   **Payment Mode**: For income entries, the "Payment Mode" (e.g., "Bank") indicates if the payment for an invoice has been received. Removing this indicates payment has not been received, which updates calculations in the Finance View <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

A Film Production Budget Tracker can be utilized to keep track of all expenses related to film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## [[expense_categorization_and_analysis | Expense Categorization]]

The tracker features a table that lists individual expenses, their respective categories, and the expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Each expense is linked to a specific category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### [[setting_budget_categories | Managing Categories]]
Users can [[setting_budget_categories | define their own categories]] by clicking on a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It's also possible to add a new category by clicking on a "new page" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, edit an existing category using the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, or delete a category via a three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The tracker allows for comprehensive budget management by integrating expense and budget tracking capabilities.

### Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses
Users can update the budgeted expense value directly within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Entering an amount on the expense side automatically updates relevant figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Any updates to these values are reflected immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### [[budgeted_expenses_summary | Summary and Analysis]]
A dedicated summary section provides a clear [[budgeted_expenses_summary | overview of expenses and budget tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This section displays:
*   The budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Actual expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   The difference between budgeted and actual amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   The percentage of actual expenses relative to the budgeted expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>

This budgeting tracker template in Notion provides a comprehensive solution for managing personal finances, offering various options to meet budgeting needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Template Components

The budgeting tracker is structured around five core components:
*   Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

For each component, users can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For example, income has a "goal amount" that can be set for each income component per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Similarly, for expenses, a "budget amount" can be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. As transactions are incurred, the template automatically updates, showing the percentage of the budgeted amount that has been used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Underneath the percentage display, a "budget status" indicates whether an expense has exceeded the budgeted amount or if it remains within the set budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This status applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Overview Sections

### Component Overview

On the left side of the screen, an overview of all elements for each component is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A dropdown menu allows selection of different components. For instance, clicking on "income overview" displays all added income categories, along with the specific income amount, the set goal amount, and the total percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This overview aggregates data across all months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

For expense sources, the overview shows the targeted amount and incurred expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, while for income sources, it shows the goal amount and the income amount met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Users can add an unlimited number of categories for each component, and these will automatically update in the filtered views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Monthly Overview

Located at the bottom of the template, a monthly overview provides a month-wise summary for each category and element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. For example, the expense summary shows categories like food, entertainment, and shopping, broken down by month (e.g., Jan 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. When a new month's transaction is added, it automatically appears as a different month in this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## [[entering_transactions_in_notion | Entering Transactions]]

To [[entering_transactions_in_notion | enter transactions]], scroll down to the quick button section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Clicking on an income button, for instance, automatically adds a new income entry to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Data Fields for Transactions

For each transaction, users need to provide the following details:
*   **Detail**: A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Date**: The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Month & Year**: Users can type in the month and year (e.g., "Jan 2024"), and it will automatically populate the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Category**: The specific category for the income or expense (e.g., "salary," "side hustle," "food," "entertainment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Categories can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Code**: A unique identifier for the source of income or expense, used to collate data for different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount**: Set at the start of the month for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount**: The actual income or expense amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This [[entering_transactions_in_notion | entering transactions in Notion]] process is consistent across all financial heads, with dedicated buttons for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Currency Customization

The default currency is set to dollars, but it can be changed to any other currency by clicking on number values, selecting "edit property," and then "number format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Budget Status and Progress

As actual amounts are entered against the budgeted figures, the template updates to show the percentage of the budget that has been incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. It also clearly indicates if the user is "under budget" or "over budget" for that specific category and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This feature helps users monitor their spending against their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Funds Balance

A "funds balance" section displays the income, total spending, and the remaining balance at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This balance dynamically updates as income and expense entries are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Spendings include expenses, debt payments, bills payments, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This provides a quick glance at the financial position at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Filtering Options

Both the monthly overview and funds balance sections can be dynamically filtered by year or month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This allows users to view data for a specific year, a specific month, or even a particular month across all years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

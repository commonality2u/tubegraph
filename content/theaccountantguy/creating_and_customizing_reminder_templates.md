This guide demonstrates how to create and customize templates for subscription payment reminders, allowing you to receive alerts directly on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These reminders are managed through a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Creating a New Reminder Template

To set up a new subscription reminder:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu within the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
2.  Select the option to "create a new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
3.  Choose the "subscription reminder alert" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
4.  Enter the name of the subscription (e.g., Spotify) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
5.  Specify the subscription amount (e.g., $150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
6.  Click "background" to add the new template as a tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Setting Up Repetition for Reminders

Once the template is created, you can set its repetition schedule:
1.  Click on the three dots next to the newly created template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  Select "repeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
3.  Choose your desired mode of repetition, such as "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This ensures the subscription amount is repeated each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
4.  A new window will appear, allowing you to specify the exact time and date for the reminder to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. For example, you can set it to repeat every month on the 23rd at 11:56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
5.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. A repetition arrow will appear, indicating the reminder is set to automatically repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Receiving and Managing Reminders

At the specified time, a new line item will be added to the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, and you will automatically receive a notification alert on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The WhatsApp notification includes a "pay now" link, allowing direct payment of the subscription amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This entire process enables you to [[setting_up_subscription_reminders_using_a_database | set up subscription reminders using a database]] and receive alerts on WhatsApp, helping you pay on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Customization Options

The reminder alerts received on WhatsApp are fully customizable to meet your specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. There is no fixed template, allowing for complete personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Once the template is downloaded, instructions are available to guide you through setting up this automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

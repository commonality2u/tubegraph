Automated notifications on WhatsApp can be set up for various purposes, such as [[setting_up_whatsapp_bill_payment_reminders | bill payment reminders]]. This process involves [[creating_a_template_for_whatsapp_notification | creating a notification template]], [[specifying_bill_recurrence_and_notification_times | setting recurrence]], and utilizing an [[automating_bill_payment_reminders_using_templates | automation]] platform like Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Sanat Biswal, "the accountant guy," demonstrates how to set up these reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Setting Up a Bill Payment Reminder

To create a new bill payment reminder on WhatsApp, follow these steps:
1.  Click on the drop-down menu and select "new template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Start writing the bill name, for example, "Mobile bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
3.  Specify the bill amount, such as fifteen hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
4.  Click "back" after entering the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Configuring Recurrence and Notification Time

Once the bill template is created, you can [[scheduling_repeating_notifications_for_debt_payments | set it to repeat]] on a recurring basis:
1.  Click the drop-down again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots next to the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Set the bill to repeat, for instance, "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  Specify the exact time you wish to receive the notification, such as 11:55 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Set the day of the month for the notification, like the 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
6.  Click "Save" to apply these settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Once saved, the notification will repeat every month on the specified date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Automation with Pabbly Connect

To enable these automated WhatsApp notifications, an [[automating_debt_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | automation]] tool like Pabbly Connect is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The video demonstrates the setup of this automation within Pabbly Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. A detailed explanation and guide are included when the template for this automation is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Once the automation is configured and the template is set to recur, notifications will be sent automatically to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Demonstration

A "Mobile bill" notification, set to be sent at 11:55 AM on the 20th, demonstrates the system's functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The system automatically adds the new bill item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> and sends the notification to WhatsApp, typically taking under a minute to deliver the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example Notification
> A sample notification for a Wi-Fi bill shows the due date (September 20) and payment amount ($3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

This system provides a reliable way to receive automated notifications for bills and other recurring payments directly on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

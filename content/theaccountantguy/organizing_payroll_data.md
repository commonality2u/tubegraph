### Detailed Payment Entry

Users can feed in [[tracking_employee_payments_with_notion | payment details]] by scrolling to the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">00:01:04</a>. This involves:
*   Entering the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">00:01:07</a>.

#### Payment Calculation
The template facilitates [[payment_calculation_for_employees | payment calculation]]:
*   For hourly paid employees, users can specify the pay rate and number of hours, and the template will automatically calculate the payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">00:01:21</a>.

## Key Features of the Notion Expense Tracker

### Category Management
The tracker includes a category section at the top, which initially displays three different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Each category can be defined according to specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

*   **Renaming Categories**: Hovering over a category reveals a pencil icon, allowing users to rename it as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This flexibility supports [[customizing_expense_categories_and_budgeting_in_notion | customizing expense categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Editing or Deleting Categories**: Categories can be edited or deleted by clicking on the three dots next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: A new category can be added by simply clicking on "new page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

*   **Automatic Updates**: As expenses are entered into the tracker, all associated categories are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

### Summary Section

*   **Budgeted Expense Amount**: Displays the total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Actual Expenses Amount**: Shows the total actual expenses, computed from the expense table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

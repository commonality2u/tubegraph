This article demonstrates how a debt payment tracker can be utilized for [[managing_debt_payments_and_statuses | managing debt payments]] and achieving debt payoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The system is designed to provide a comprehensive [[synthesizing_debt_overview_and_summary_in_notion | debt overview and summary]] and allows for detailed [[debt_and_liability_tracking | debt and liability tracking]].

## Debt Overview Section

The "Debt Overview" section divides debts into different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Pre-defined Categories
Initially, the tracker includes categories for "annual payment" and "monthly payments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Customizing and Adding Categories
Users can add new installment periods or categories, such as "weekly" or "quarterly," by clicking an "add a group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The system already provides necessary payment schedules for reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, including options like "quarterly repayment" and "weekly repayments" which may be hidden initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Debts can be moved between these repayment schedules, which automatically updates the repayment schedule and other related calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Debt Details Overview
Each debt category displays specific details in columns:
*   **Debt details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Loan amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **EMI amount**: The fixed amount to be paid for each installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   **Interest rate**: User-specified interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Initial repayment**: The first payment date for the loan's first installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Debt free by**: A calculated date showing when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue at the specified amount and interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Number of EMI**: The total number of installments required to pay off the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

## Debt Payoff Progress

This section provides a summary and progress report for all loans added to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

It displays:
*   **Total amount repaid**: This amount is updated automatically based on installments recorded in the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Net payoff in percentage**: Indicates the percentage of the total debt that has been paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Debt free by**: A quick reference to the estimated debt-free date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Interest amount paid**: The total interest paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Principal amount repaid**: The portion of the total repayment attributed to the principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Every debt repayment is split into interest and principal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Managing Debt Entries
*   **Adding New Debt**: A "add details" button quickly adds a new debt entry to a "no payment frequency" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Once added, it can be moved to a specific payment frequency and its details can be entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This feature is part of [[building_a_debt_database_in_notion | building a debt database]].
*   **Editing Existing Debt**: Existing loan details can be edited by clicking on the debt field, and changes will automatically update across all columns and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This allows for [[updating_and_managing_debt_installment_details | updating and managing debt installment details]].

## Transaction Section

The "Transaction section" provides a record of all [[debt_payment_tracking_and_analysis | debt payments]] made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Paid Installment Section
This section displays all paid debts, bifurcated by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A summation of all EMIs paid for each particular month is also provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Key details in this section include:
*   **Paid status**: A checkbox to mark if the amount has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Ticking this box moves the entry to the paid installment section, while unticking moves it to the unpaid column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Payment date**: The date of the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Loan details**: Allows selecting a specific loan that was added earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI amount of payment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Next repayment schedule**: Automatically calculated based on the set payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, a student loan with monthly payments paid on September 30th will show October 30th as the next payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Similarly, an annual home loan paid on September 27, 2023, will show September 27, 2024, as the next repayment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Adding Debt Payments
A "pay debt amount" button allows users to automatically add a new debt payment to the schedule, set to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Users can then fill in details and descriptions as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This feature helps in [[tracking_debt_payments_and_budgets | tracking debt payments and budgets]].

## Automatic Updates

The tracker ensures that all sections, including the debt payoff progress, update automatically as payment details are added or modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. For instance, changing the EMI amount for a student loan instantly updates the total amount repaid in the debt payoff progress section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This automatic [[classifying_and_managing_income_and_expenses | classification and management of income and expenses]] streamlines the process of [[creating_a_notion_debt_tracker | creating a Notion debt tracker]].

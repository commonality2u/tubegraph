Notion databases can be used to perform calculations, such as finding the product of two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This can be achieved by [[using_formulas_in_notion | using formulas in Notion]] within the database properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Database Setup

To calculate the product of two numbers in Notion, a database can be configured with the following properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:

*   **Name of the Operator**: A title property, which for this calculation is the "multiply operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Number Properties**: Two separate number properties, each assigned to a number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Formula Properties**: At least one formula property to perform the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Methods for Calculating Product

Two different methods can be used to calculate the product of two numbers within a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, essentially [[using_excellike_formulas_in_notion | using Excel-like formulas in Notion]].

### 1. Multiply Operator Formula

This method involves using a dedicated "multiply operator formula" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The two numbers are provided as inputs to this formula to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### 2. Multiply Symbol Formula

Alternatively, a formula can simply use the multiply symbol (`*`) placed between the two numbers to achieve the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Example

For instance, if the input numbers are 2 and 3, using the multiply operator formula (or the multiply symbol formula) will yield a product of 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

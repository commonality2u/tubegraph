This article explains how to utilize a [[charity_donation_tracking_using_notion | charity donation tracker]] in Notion to monitor all your charitable contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The tracker is divided into three main sections: Fund Setup, Donations Overview, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Fund Setup
The "Fund Setup" section allows for organizing donations into categories and setting up individual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Categories
Donations are initially divided into three default categories: Health, Environment, and Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   Existing categories can be edited by clicking on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   New categories can be added by sliding the bottom slider to the right and clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Individual Funds
Under each category, different funds are set up, such as American Red Cross, WHO, and Care funds for Health; Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, and The Rainforest Foundation for Environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   To add a new fund, click the "Add Funds" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   New funds appear unclassified, and can be moved to an existing category by clicking the three dots next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Fund details are edited via a pencil icon and include:
    *   **Name of the fund** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
    *   **Opening balance**: The amount donated to the fund at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Targeted donation**: The desired total donation amount for the specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   **Start date**: When donations began for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   **Target date**: The deadline to reach the targeted donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Existing funds can be edited or deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Recent Donations
This section, located at the bottom of the tracker, logs all individual donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Donations are split month-wise, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Each donation entry includes:
    *   **Date**: When the donation was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

A paycheck budget tracker allows users to track their paycheck payments and budget effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It helps in [[tracking_income_and_expenses_effectively | keeping track of budgeted payments]] and staying on top of finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Tracker Sections

The tracker is divided into two main sections: the Summary section and the Account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Summary Section

The left-side Summary section provides an [[overview_of_expenses_and_budget_tracking | overview of expenses and budget tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It displays:
*   Total budgeted expenses set by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   Total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   The difference between budgeted and incurred expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   The percentage of budgeted expense spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Account Section

The right-side Account section allows users to add their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Expenses can be categorized under three default heads:
*   Fixed Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Variable Expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Savings and Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

Users can customize these category heads by clicking on them, setting their own category, and confirming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. After adding accounts, users can set a budgeted amount for each expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Transaction Section

Once budgeted amounts are set, users proceed to the transaction section to add all expense-related transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This section reflects data in the expense section, showing the total budgeted amount, incurred expenses, and the percentage of budgeted expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This enables [[tracking_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | tracking budgeted versus actual expenses]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Quick Action Buttons

The tracker includes quick action buttons for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:

*   **Add Transaction**: Automatically adds a transaction with the current date, allowing users to feed in details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Add Expense Source**: Automatically adds an expense source under one of the existing heads, such as "Fixed expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This new expense source can then be moved to any other desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

This template helps users [[tracking_expenses_against_a_budget | keep their budgeted payments in check]] and stay on top of their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

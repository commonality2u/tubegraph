This guide explains how to utilize a template to [[setting_up_emergency_funds_in_notion | track your emergency funds]], specifically focusing on [[using_categories_for_effective_expense_management | organizing them by category]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template includes a summary section at the top, which provides an overview of the fund setup, savings, and required contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The "Fund Setup" section is where you define and manage your emergency fund categories and individual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Predefined Categories and Customization
Initially, the template provides three default categories for your emergency funds:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

You have the flexibility to [[customizing_fund_categories_and_goals_in_notion | customize these categories]] by editing their names or by adding new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. To add a new category, simply click the "Add a Group" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Adding and Configuring Funds
To add a new emergency fund, click the "Add Fund" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. New funds are initially added to a "No Classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, from which you can move them to their respective categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

For each fund, you can configure several details:
*   **Fund Detail**: A general description of the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance**: The initial amount available for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: The targeted savings amount for that specific emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This is the desired end goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Start Date**: When you begin contributing to the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The template automatically calculates savings made to date from this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Target End Date**: The date by which you aim to have the total emergency fund available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Contributions

Once your emergency fund categories and funds are set up, you can start [[tracking_emergency_fund_contributions | tracking contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Monthly View and Entry
Contributions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For each contribution, you can enter:
*   **Date**: The specific date of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief note about the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Period**: The month and year the contribution pertains to (e.g., March 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. You can add new months as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Fund**: Select the specific emergency fund to which the contribution is being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The actual amount of savings or contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Monitoring Against Requirements
The template helps you monitor if you're meeting your savings goals by displaying a "Requirement" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This column shows how much contribution is required each month to meet your targeted end goal by the specified end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. If your entered "Amount" is equal to or exceeds the "Requirement," a tick mark will appear, indicating you've met the monthly target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Quick Action Button
A "Quick Action Button" can be used to automatically add a new line item for the current date and month, pre-filling some fields and linking formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Savings Overview

The "Savings Overview" section provides a detailed look at each emergency fund's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Funds are again grouped by their classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

For each fund, you can see:
*   **Total Savings**: The sum of the starting balance and all contributions made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings**: The goal amount set for that fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Achievement Percentage**: The percentage of the targeted savings that has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Targeted Savings Date**: The end date set for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Months Left**: The remaining time until the target end date, calculated from the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This updates automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Contribution Required Per Month**: The calculated monthly contribution needed to meet the fund's goal by the target end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview

The "Quarterly Overview" section allows you to view your contributions grouped by quarter, providing a glance at your progress over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This view shows total savings and requirements for each month within a quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It also displays the "Savings Requirement Percentage," indicating how well you've met your targets for the period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The total savings for each quarter are displayed at the top of the section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Summary Section

The main summary section at the top of the template provides a high-level overview of all your emergency funds combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. It includes:
*   **Total Savings**: The sum of opening balances for all funds and all contributions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Savings Required**: The summation of all targeted savings amounts across all funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The total savings minus the total required savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage**: The total savings as a percentage of the total targeted savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

This [[budgeting_and_savings_strategy | comprehensive summary]] gives a quick snapshot of your overall progress in meeting your emergency fund goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

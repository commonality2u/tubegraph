The business cash flow template offers functionalities for classifying financial items and setting their payment frequencies, which are crucial for effective [[tracking_and_managing_transactions_for_cash_flow | tracking and managing transactions for cash flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. These settings are configured within the [[organizing_funds_into_categories_for_financial_management | account]] section of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Classification

Classification refers to how a specific financial item is categorized within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. For example, a credit card is classified as a debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

### Managing Classifications
*   **Existing Classifications**: The template provides several existing classifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Adding New Classifications**: Users can add new classifications if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   **Editing Existing Classifications**: Existing classifications can be edited by clicking on a three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Payment Frequency

Payment frequency indicates how frequently a payment is received or made for a particular item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for [[income_and_expense_categorization_and_analysis | income]] and [[income_and_expense_categorization_and_analysis | expenses]] management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

### Application and Examples
*   **Income**: For instance, interest [[income_and_expense_categorization_and_analysis | income]] might have a quarterly payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Assets**: If an asset involves periodical payments or receipts, its frequency can be specified here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

The template allows users to select from available frequencies to specify the payment schedule for different items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

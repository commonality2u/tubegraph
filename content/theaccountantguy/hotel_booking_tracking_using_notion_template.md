A simple Notion template is available to track hotel bookings, providing an overview of reservations and guest information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The template features two main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) at the top of the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

*   **Bookings by Room Type** This KPI displays the number of bookings made for different room types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Under each room type, the total number of guests who have booked that specific room is shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Free Pickup Requests** This KPI indicates how many guests have requested free pickup and how many have not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

These KPIs are dynamically updated as new data is entered into the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Booking Details Table

A simple table at the bottom of the template allows for the entry of specific booking details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Guest Information
Columns are available for:
*   Guest Name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Email ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Contact Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Special Request (a free-text placeholder for any specific guest needs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>

### Dates
*   **Arrival Date** This column records the guest's arrival date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The option to include an arrival time can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Departure Date** This column records the guest's departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Similar to the arrival date, a departure time can also be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Room Type Selection
The "Room Type" column allows users to select an existing room type from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Users can also type in a new room type, which will automatically create a new category in the database and update the top KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Icons for room types can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Changes to room types in the table are automatically synced with the KPIs at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Guest Count
The "Guest Count" column is used to enter the number of guests for a particular reservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. By default, this information is not displayed in the top KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Free Pickup Option
The "Free Pickup" column offers a "Yes" or "No" option, which automatically updates the free pickup summary in the KPIs at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Customization
This Notion template for hotel bookings is fully customizable to meet specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

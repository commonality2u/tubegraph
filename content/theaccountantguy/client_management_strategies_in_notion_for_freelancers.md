Notion Freelancers OS is a dashboard designed to help freelancers manage their entire finances, including income and expense details, and their client management [00:00:12]. This comprehensive setup allows for tracking all aspects of a freelancing business within Notion [00:00:14].

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard features two primary navigation windows:
1.  **Finance Section** [00:00:48]: Primarily focuses on tracking income and expense details [00:00:14]. Instructions are available on how to change currency and use the finance setup [00:00:30].
2.  **Client Section** [00:00:56]: Dedicated to [[invoicing_and_workflow_management_in_notion | client management]], including invoicing, client details, projects, and services [00:00:19].

### Integrating Finance with Client Management
Any income related to client work can be added in the finance section and classified as "client" [00:01:44]. This classification ensures that these income transactions automatically reflect in the client portal's workflow section [00:02:45].

## Client Section Components

The client section provides four main areas at the outset, along with additional tools and a workflow section [00:03:33]:
*   Invoicing details [00:03:37]
*   Client details [00:03:39]
*   Project details [00:03:42]
*   Services section [00:03:45]

Underneath these core sections, there are tools:
*   Resources [00:03:54]
*   Contacts [00:03:59]
*   Goals [00:04:06]
*   Calendar [00:04:14]

Finally, the workflow detail section displays all income classified under "client," integrating financial data directly into client management [00:04:25].

### Managing Client Details

The [[using_notion_for_relationship_management | client details]] section organizes clients into three pipelines [00:05:10]:
*   **Lead**: For potential clients [00:05:22].
*   **Negotiation**: For clients in the negotiation process [00:05:27].
*   **Client**: For active clients [00:05:32].

To add a new client, click the "new" option within any category [00:05:37]. Client cards display key information:
*   **Invoice Amount**: Automatically pulled from linked invoices [00:06:00].
*   **Contract Value**: Manually entered by the user [00:07:01].
*   **Invoiced Percentage**: Calculated based on the invoice amount relative to the contract value [00:07:28].

Detailed client information, such as company, contact, email, position, stage, and website, can be added within each client's dedicated window [00:07:51]. Clients can be flexibly moved between pipelines by dragging and dropping them into the desired category [00:09:14].

### Handling Projects

The projects section helps track all work performed for a client, especially when a contract is divided into multiple projects [00:10:10]. Projects are categorized by priority: Low, Medium, and High [00:10:33].

When adding a new project, you can specify [00:10:40]:
*   **Project Name** [00:10:51]
*   **Project Value** [00:11:02]
*   **Completion Date**: Can be a single date or a range with a start and end date [00:11:30].
*   **Status**: E.g., "Not Started" [00:12:18].

Project completion is calculated based on two methods [00:14:45]:
1.  **Hourly Basis**: Track estimated hours versus actual hours spent [00:14:48]. For example, if a project is estimated for 10 hours and 7 hours are completed, it shows 70% completion [00:15:44].
2.  **Invoicing Basis**: Calculated based on the total invoiced amount for the project relative to the total project value [00:15:06]. For instance, if a $6,000 project has $3,000 invoiced, it shows 50% completion [00:15:27].

Each project links to the relevant client and associated services [00:16:38]. Projects can be moved between priority categories by dragging and dropping [00:13:39].

### Managing Services

Services are sub-components of projects, following a chain: Client → Project → Services [00:17:44]. Services are divided into three categories: Not Started, In Progress, and Completed [00:17:57].

When adding a new service, details to include are [00:18:13]:
*   **Service Name** [00:18:21]
*   **Service Pricing**: Can be hourly or a fixed flat rate [00:18:27].
*   **Service Rate**: The amount per hour or the fixed fee [00:18:46].

Additional service properties include duration, status, and, in future editions, assigned team members [00:19:37]. Each service also shows the client it's provided to and the project it's part of [00:20:11]. Services can be reclassified into different categories by dragging and dropping [00:19:06].

### Invoicing Section

The invoicing section tracks the status of all invoices [00:21:17]:
*   **Draft**: Invoices that are still being prepared [00:21:23].
*   **Sent**: Invoices that have been sent to the client [00:21:26].
*   **Paid**: Invoices for which payment has been received [00:21:29].

The section displays the total invoice amount for each status [00:21:33]. Users can also count the number of unique invoices in each category [00:21:43].

To add a new invoice [00:22:06]:
*   Specify the **Invoice Number** [00:22:15].
*   Set the **Due Date** [00:22:34].

The invoice amount is automatically populated from the workflow section at the bottom of the dashboard [00:22:29].

#### Workflow Integration for Invoicing

The workflow section lists all client-related income carried over from the finance section [00:23:08]. For each income entry, you can link it to specific [00:23:35]:
*   **Invoice**: Assign an existing invoice or create a new one directly from this view [00:23:39]. Creating a new invoice here automatically adds it to the invoicing section with a "Draft" status [00:25:54].
*   **Client**: Link the income to a specific client [00:24:37].
*   **Project**: Assign the income to a relevant project [00:25:15].
*   **Service**: Connect the income to a particular service provided [00:25:22].

This dynamic linkage ensures that as you add details in the workflow, the information is automatically updated in the respective client, project, and service sections [00:25:06].

The `Payment Mode` column in the workflow indicates if payment has been received [00:27:10]. Removing the payment mode implies the money has not yet been received, impacting banking calculations in the finance view [00:27:16].

## Tools Section

The "Tools" section provides additional utilities to support business operations [00:28:56].

### Resources

The resources section serves as a centralized repository for useful information, categorized as [00:29:07]:
*   Checklists
*   Guides
*   Strategies
*   Tips

Users can add new resources, assign categories (e.g., taxes, budgeting, investments, savings), add external links, and include notes or to-do lists using Notion's slash commands [00:29:14].

### Contacts

This section allows for creating a catalog of business contacts, categorized by the type of service they provide (e.g., Finance, Services, Legal) [00:31:30]. When adding a contact, details such as designation, phone number, address, email ID, and company name can be included [00:31:57]. Custom categories for contacts can also be created [00:32:31].

### Goals

The goals section is for setting personal or business objectives, typically classified under Health, Wealth, and Relationship [00:33:06]. For each goal, a target date can be set [00:33:30]. Goal completion percentage is calculated based on a numerical target and the progress achieved so far (e.g., "lose 10 pounds" target with "3 pounds achieved" showing 30% completion) [00:33:46].

### Calendar

The calendar view provides a quick glance at all scheduled meetings for the month [00:34:24]. To add a new meeting [00:34:42]:
*   Enter the **Meeting Title** and **Agenda** [00:34:52].
*   Assign a **Client** or **Contact** from the respective databases [00:35:07].
*   Select the **Meeting Medium** (e.g., Google Meet, Skype) [00:35:30].
*   Attach **Reference Documents** via upload or embedded link [00:35:48].
*   Set the **Priority** (low, medium, or high) [00:36:04].

The calendar view can be customized to display meetings weekly or monthly [00:36:27].

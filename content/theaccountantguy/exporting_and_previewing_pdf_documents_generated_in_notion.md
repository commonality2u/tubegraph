This article details the process of [[generating_pdf_documents_in_bulk_using_notion_and_pdf_output | generating PDF documents in bulk]] and previewing them using a Notion database and a PDF output tool. The example shown focuses on [[creating_pdf_documents_from_a_notion_database | creating boarding pass PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before generating PDF documents, two main components are required:
*   A Notion database containing the details for the documents, such as a "boarding pass database" with specific information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   A Notion template, like a "boarding pass template," designed for the PDF output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This demonstrates [[using_notion_templates_for_pdf_generation | using Notion templates for PDF generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Generating PDF Documents

To generate PDF documents from Notion using the PDF output tool, follow these steps:
1.  **Initiate Connection**: In the connection details of the PDF output tool, type the name of the document type, such as "boarding pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This involves [[using_pdf_output_tool_with_notion | using the PDF output tool with Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  **Select Database and Template**: Connect the relevant Notion database by selecting it (e.g., "boarding pass database") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Then, select the appropriate Notion template (e.g., "boarding pass template") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This illustrates [[setting_up_notion_databases_for_pdf_generation | setting up Notion databases for PDF generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
3.  **Load Information**: Click "next" to initiate the loading of information from the Notion database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
4.  **Export Documents**: Once all information is loaded from the database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, click "export" to begin [[generating_pdf_documents_from_notion_database | generating the PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The system will start generating PDF documents based on your specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Previewing and Accessing Generated PDFs

After the export process is complete:
1.  **Confirm Success**: The export process will indicate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
2.  **Preview Sample**: To view a sample of the generated PDF, click "preview sample" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. This allows you to verify that the boarding pass has been generated with all the details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>.
3.  **Download Files**: You can then proceed to download the generated files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.
4.  **Access Documents**: Once downloaded, the files can be opened and extracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>. The generated output will include multiple PDF files, each with different names and contexts, demonstrating [[bulk_pdf_document_generation_using_notion | bulk PDF document generation using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

The Notion Budgeting Tracker offers a comprehensive solution for managing personal finances, providing various options to fulfill budgeting needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It provides an overview of income, expenses, debts, bills, and savings, allowing users to [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | set budget amounts]] and track actual spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Components Overview

The tracker includes five main components:
*   **Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Expense** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Bills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Savings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

For each component, users can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For income, a goal amount can be set for each income component per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For expenses, a budget amount can be set, which automatically updates as expenses are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The tracker also displays the percentage of the budgeted amount incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Underneath the percentage, a "budget status" indicates whether spending has exceeded the budgeted amount or remained within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This status applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Data Overview and Entry

On the left side of the tracker, an overview of elements for each component is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. By clicking a dropdown, users can view specific details, such as the income overview, which shows all added income categories, their specific income amounts, goal amounts, and the total percentage of the goal achieved across all months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Similarly, for expense sources, it shows the targeted amount and the expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Users can add as many categories as needed for each component, and the display will update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Transactions are entered using quick buttons located in a dedicated section below the main overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Clicking an "income" or "expense" button automatically adds a new entry to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Fields for inputting transaction details include:
*   **Detail**: A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   **Date**: The specific date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   **Month and Year**: The month and year in which the income or expense occurred. Users can type in their specific month and year, which will automatically add the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Category**: The specific category for the income or expense source (e.g., salary, side hustle, food, entertainment, shopping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Categories can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Code**: A unique identifier for the source of income or expense, used to collate data for different months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Budget Amount**: The planned amount set at the start of the month for each source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Actual Amount**: The actual income or expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The bottom section of the tracker provides a month-wise summary, mirroring the top summary but with monthly divisions for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. For example, expense summaries show categories like food, entertainment, and shopping under specific months like Jan 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. As new months or categories are added and updated, everything will automatically reflect in these views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Currency Customization
The currency for number values can be changed from dollars to any other currency by clicking on "edit property" for number values and selecting the desired number format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Notion supports a variety of default currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Filtering Budget Data

The tracker offers dynamic filtering capabilities for viewing specific data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

*   **Filter by Year**: Users can filter the entire dataset for a particular year (e.g., 2024) to see all values relevant to that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Filter by Month**: Users can also filter by a specific month (e.g., January) to see data for that month across all years, or for a specific month within a chosen year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Funds Balance View

The "funds balance" view shows the income and spending for every month, along with the remaining balance at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This balance automatically updates as income and expense entries are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Spendings are derived from expense, debt, bills, and savings payments, while income comes from income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This view provides a quick glance at the account balance at the end of every month and can also be filtered dynamically by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

This budgeting tracker aims to solve all general budgeting requirements, and users can reach out for customization needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

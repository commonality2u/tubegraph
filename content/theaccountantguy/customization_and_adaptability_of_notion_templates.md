Notion templates, such as the Notion expenses tracker, offer extensive customization and adaptability to manage various financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01"></a>.

## Key Customizable Features

### Expense Categories

*   **Renaming Categories:** Users can rename any category by hovering over it, clicking the pencil icon that appears, and typing in the new name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25"></a>.
*   **Editing and Deleting Categories:** Categories can be edited or deleted by clicking on the three dots icon next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41"></a>.
*   **Adding New Categories:** A new category can be added by clicking the "new page" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48"></a>.

Each category includes a "budgeted expense amount" and an "actual expense amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52"></a>.

### Dynamic Expense Tracking
The template automatically updates category totals as expenses are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03"></a>. For example, if three expenses are listed under three defined categories, entering amounts for these expenses will immediately update the respective category totals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58"></a>.

*   The difference between budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37"></a>
*   The percentage of the budget that has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37"></a>

### Setting Budgeted Amounts

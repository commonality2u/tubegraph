The "Account section" in the business cash flow template allows users to define and manage various financial accounts under different heads, which is crucial for tracking cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Accessing the Account Section
The Account section is located on the right side of the cash flow overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Clicking on it reveals the setup for different accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Account Types
Accounts are organized under different financial categories:
*   **Assets**: Examples include cash, bank, receivables, input taxes, and other receivables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Users can add or edit their own assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Liabilities**: This section operates on the same principle as assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Income**: This section also follows the same principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: Similar to other sections, users can add or edit expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Editing Existing Accounts
To edit an existing account, click on the pencil icon next to the item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This allows you to change the name of the asset or account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Account Details and Classifications
Each account can have several details defined:

### Opening Balance
This represents the starting balance of the asset when you begin using the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### [[categories_and_classifications_in_bookkeeping | Classifications]]
[[categories_and_classifications_in_bookkeeping | Classifications]] define how a specific item is categorized, for instance, a credit card classified as a debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Adding/Editing [[categories_and_classifications_in_bookkeeping | Classifications]]**: Users can select from several existing [[categories_and_classifications_in_bookkeeping | classifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. New [[categories_and_classifications_in_bookkeeping | classifications]] can be added, or existing ones can be edited by clicking the three-dot icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Payment Frequency
This indicates how frequently payments are received or made for a particular item, useful for tracking income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For example, interest income might have a quarterly payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Users can specify the frequency from available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Opening Units
This field is relevant for [[classifying_inventory_into_categories | inventory]] or [[managing_investment_categories_and_classifications | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. For example, an [[classifying_inventory_into_categories | inventory]] item might have 10 opening units with an opening balance of 1300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Asset Class
This is only relevant for [[classifying_inventory_into_categories | inventory]] or [[managing_investment_categories and classifications | investments]] within the asset section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. [[classifying_inventory_into_categories | Inventory]] items can be classified under "inventory asset class," and [[managing_investment_categories_and_classifications | investments]] under "investment asset class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Adding New Accounts
To add a new item under any category (assets, liabilities, income, expenses), click the "New" button within the respective category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

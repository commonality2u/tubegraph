The Notion Formula Chatbot is designed to assist Notion users in finding the correct [[formulas_in_notion | formulas]] for their specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It aims to help users derive the exact [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] needed when [[using_formulas_in_notion | using Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Chatbot Interaction Basics
To begin interacting with the chatbot, users must input their OpenAI API key and select a GPT model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. The interface is divided into three sections: Info, Chat, and Give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Users interact with the bot in the Chat section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. The chatbot provides instant responses to queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

### Examples of Questions and Formula Responses

The chatbot can handle various [[using_excellike_formulas_in_notion | Notion formula]] questions, from basic arithmetic to more complex conditional logic.

#### Adding Two Numbers
*   **Question**: "what is the [[applying_formula_for_multiplication_in_notion | formula]] to add two numbers in Notion?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>
*   **Chatbot's Response**: To add two numbers in Notion, the [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] `property A + property B` can be used, where "property A" and "property B" represent the two numbers to be input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

#### Finding Time Difference Between Two Dates
*   **Question**: "what is the [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] to find the difference between the birth date and today's date in years in Notion?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>
*   **Chatbot's Response**: The `dateBetween` [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] can be used, specifying `years` as the unit to obtain the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The chatbot also provides an explanation of what needs to be identified for the [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

#### Using IF Conditions
*   **Question**: "If number one is greater than number two, I want to generate number one as the output; otherwise, I want to generate number two as the output." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>
*   **Chatbot's Response**: The chatbot is fluent with IF conditions, responding that if `number one` is greater than `number two`, `number one` should be the output; otherwise, `number two` should be the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. It provides a detailed explanation of the [[formulas_in_notion | formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

### Prompting for Better Results
While the chatbot responds instantly, for more complex queries, better prompting from the user's end may be required, such as providing proper examples or references to what the user is trying to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

### Interface and Customization
*   **Sections**: The chatbot has an Info panel (containing details and an embedded video), a Chat section (for interactions), and a Give section (for donations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
*   **Chat History**: Users can clear their chat history using a dedicated button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **Theme and Font**: The color theme can be changed from dark to light (or vice-versa) through settings accessed via a three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. Font family can also be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
*   **Panel Visibility**: On smaller screens or when the left panel is not visible, it can be opened by clicking an arrow icon on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **Image Option**: Users can upload an image to customize their user icon in the chat interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

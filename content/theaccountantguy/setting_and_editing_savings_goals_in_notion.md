The [[creating_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | savings funds tracker]] in Notion provides a dashboard with two main views for managing your savings: "Savings Target" and "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This dynamic setup allows users to [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | track personal finances]] by setting, editing, and monitoring their savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Savings Target View

The "Savings Target" view is where you define individual savings funds and their corresponding target amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds
To modify a default or existing saving fund:
*   Click on the pencil icon next to the fund name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   Rename the saving fund (e.g., "car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Click on the goal amount to set a new target (e.g., changing from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The "Savings Overview" will automatically update with these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Alternatively, click on the fund entry directly to open all options for editing the name and goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds
To create a new savings goal:
*   Click the "Add Savings" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A new entry will appear below the existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Click the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Give the new fund a name (e.g., "new saving fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Set the goal amount (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The default goal amount for new entries is $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds
To remove a savings fund:
*   Click on the six dots located on the left side of the fund entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Select the "Delete" option that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The fund will be automatically deleted from the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Savings Overview
The "Savings Overview" provides a summary of your financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It displays:
*   Total savings accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   The overall targeted saving amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   The percentage of the targeted amount achieved so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Adding Transactions to Savings Funds
To contribute to a specific savings fund:
*   Navigate to the "Transactions panel" located at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Click "Add Transaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A new transaction entry will appear with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Transactions are organized by month, with the latest month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. You can also manually set a different date using the calendar window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Enter a description for the transaction (e.g., "saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   In the "Saving Fund" column, select the specific fund from the dropdown list (e.g., "car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Input the saving amount for that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   The total savings for that fund, and the overall "Savings Overview," will automatically update to reflect the new contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Currency and Customization
The [[creating_a_savings_funds_tracker_in_notion | savings funds tracker]] supports different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. To change the currency format:
*   Click on any amount field that displays currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Select "Edit Property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   Under "Number Format," choose from the various currencies Notion supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

The view for transactions is dynamically grouped by date, typically by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This grouping can be altered to display transactions by week or year by clicking on the three dots, then "Grouping," and selecting the desired date unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The entire tracker is customizable to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

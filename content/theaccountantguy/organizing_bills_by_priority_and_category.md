Organizing bills by priority and category is a key feature within a [[creating_a_bills_tracker_in_notion|Notion bills tracker]] to provide a clear overview of financial commitments and spending patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This classification helps in understanding financial distribution and managing expenses more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## Bill Prioritization

Bills are classified based on their urgency or importance, typically into three levels:
*   **Low Priority** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>
*   **Medium Priority** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>
*   **High Priority** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>

The "Bills Priority database" in Notion helps manage this classification, showing the actual expense incurred for each priority level and the percentage of bills paid within that priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. The primary dashboard of the Notion bills tracker displays this "bills distribution as per priority," indicating expenses incurred and the percentage of bills paid for low, medium, and high priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

## Bill Categorization

Bills are categorized into six main types to provide a detailed breakdown of spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. These categories include:
*   Entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>
*   Food and Groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>
*   Utility Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>
*   Travel and Transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>
*   Loans and Debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>
*   Others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>

The "Bills Category database" organizes bills by these six types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. For each category, the tracker shows the total amount paid and the percentage of bills paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. Information extracted for each category includes the number of bills paid, actual expenses incurred, and bills paid in percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. The Notion dashboard includes a section for "bills distribution as per category," reflecting total expenses incurred and payment percentage for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

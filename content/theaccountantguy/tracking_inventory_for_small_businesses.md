This article demonstrates how a specific template, designed by "the accountant guy" (Sanat Biswal), can be utilized to [[managing_inventory_transactions | track inventory]] for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The template is structured into an [[inventory_portfolio_and_transactions | inventory portfolio]] and a transactions section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Inventory Portfolio

The [[inventory_portfolio_and_transactions | inventory portfolio]] at the top of the template features three main views: [[inventory_setup_and_classification | Inventory Setup]], [[inventory_portfolio_and_transactions | Inventory Portfolio]], and Inventory Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Inventory Setup

The [[inventory_setup_and_classification | Inventory Setup]] section classifies inventory into three categories:
*   Raw Materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Work in Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Finished Goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

For each added inventory item, several details are tracked:
*   **Opening Balance**: The starting balance of the inventory at the beginning of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Opening Number of Units**: The initial count of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Valuation Principle**: Options like FIFO, LIFO, or WSC valuation principles are available, but can be left as default if not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Reorder Level**: The specific unit level at which inventory should be reordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. For example, Wheat has a reorder level of 60 units, and Corn has 10 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Percentage**: Indicates the proportion of a particular inventory item relative to the total inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

New inventory items can be added by clicking an "add inventory" button, which places them in a "no classification" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These can then be moved to a specific category (e.g., Work in Progress) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, and their values can be entered via a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Inventory Portfolio View

In the [[inventory_portfolio_and_transactions | inventory portfolio]] section, users can see:
*   The inventory value at the end of the transaction period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   The number of units available after all purchases and sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   A **Reorder Status Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. If units drop below the predefined reorder level, a "low stock" message appears, prompting reordering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Wheat has 30 units available, which is below its 60-unit reorder level, indicating a need to reorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Corn has 70 units available, which is above its 10-unit reorder level, indicating it is "available in Surplus" and does not need reordering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Inventory Status

The Inventory Status section tracks the current location or stage of inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Statuses include:
*   In Transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   In Progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   Not Sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
Users can edit existing statuses or add new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   *Example*: A Corn purchase of 50 units for 500 made on August 26th is currently "in transit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This item can be moved to a different status as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   *Example*: A sales item is currently under the "not sent" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Transaction Section

The [[entering_and_managing_transactions_for_small_businesses | transaction section]] is divided into Purchases, Sales, and Profit and Loss for inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Purchases

The Purchases section allows users to record inventory acquisitions:
*   Transactions are displayed by current date and bifurcated by month, with newer dates appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Users can add a description for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   The specific inventory account (e.g., Wheat, Corn, Bread) can be selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   Number of units and purchase price are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   The total purchase amount populates automatically based on price and units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   An inventory status can be assigned to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   A "buy inventory" quick action button automatically adds a purchase transaction to the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Sales

The Sales section is similar to the Purchases section, used to record sales of inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Profit and Loss

For every sale, the Profit and Loss section requires the user to input the purchase price or cost of the particular item sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   *Example*: If bread was sold for $40 and its manufacturing cost was $10, inputting these values automatically calculates the profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   The template can calculate the profit from a sale by deducting the cost from the sales price and multiplying by the units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

This template helps to track inventory, assign statuses, and understand the current location and financial standing of inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

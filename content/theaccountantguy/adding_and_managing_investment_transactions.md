The Investment Portfolio tracker allows users to track all their [[investment_tracking_and_dashboard_analysis | Investments]] and manage related [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transactions]] with ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tracker includes a dedicated section for viewing and inputting investment [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Transaction Section Overview

The transaction section of the [[investment_tracking_and_dashboard_analysis | Investment Portfolio tracker]] displays all conducted [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transactions]] and offers various views to categorize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### All Transactions View

The "All" view lists every type of [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transaction]], including both buy and sell actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. For each [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transaction]], users must input the following details:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   **Type of transaction** (e.g., Buy, Sell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   **Investment Account**: The specific investment (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin) involved in the [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transaction]] can be selected from a dropdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Number of Units**: The quantity of units being bought or sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Price**: The price per unit is automatically calculated in the buy and sell sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Amount**: This is a calculated field, derived from the units multiplied by the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Buy Transactions

The "Buy" view focuses specifically on [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transactions]] where investments are acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Users can fill in all the standard [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transaction]] information, including the buy price, which then automatically calculates the buy amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Sell Transactions

Similar to buy [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transactions]], the "Sell" view is dedicated to [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transactions]] where investments are sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The same data entry process applies, ensuring accurate recording of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Profit and Loss Section

The "Profit and Loss" section provides a detailed view of the financial outcome of each [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   It displays the same [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transaction]] data but adds an essential "Buy price" information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   By inputting the buy amount, the system automatically reflects the profit or loss generated from that specific [[adding_and_managing_transactions | transaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   For example, if 30 units of Apple stock were sold for $40 each (totaling $1,200) and originally bought for $10 each, the profit and loss section would show a profit of $900 (calculated as ($40 - $10) * 30 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Quick Action Buttons for Transactions

The [[investment_tracking_and_dashboard_analysis | Investment Portfolio tracker]] includes [[quick_action_buttons_for_managing_investments | quick action buttons]] to streamline the process of [[adding_and_managing_transactions | adding transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Buy Investment**: Clicking this button automatically adds a new entry under the "Buy" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It pre-populates the current date, which can then be adjusted by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Sell Investment**: Similarly, this button creates a new line item under the "Sell" view, ready for the user to input the necessary details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

This budgeting tracker template offers various options for customizing how you view and filter your financial data, providing a comprehensive overview of your budgeting needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Core Components and Overviews

The tracker includes five main components: Income, Expense, Debt, Bills, and Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For each component, you can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

On the left side of the interface, you can access an overview of all elements for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A drop-down menu allows you to select which component's overview you wish to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Component-Specific Views

*   **Income Overview:** When you select "income overview," it displays all income categories you've added, along with the specific income amount, your set goal amount, and the total percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Expense Overview:** For expenses, you can set a budget amount, and as you incur expenses, the system automatically updates the percentage of the budgeted amount you've spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A budget status indicates whether you've stayed within or gone beyond your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Selecting different components from the drop-down will show either the targeted amount and incurred expense (for expense sources) or the goal amount and met income amount (for income sources) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Category Customization
You can add as many categories as needed for each component, and they will automatically update in the specific views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Categories can also be edited directly from the entry details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Monthly and Overall Summaries

Below the main overview, a monthly overview is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This section offers a month-wise division summary, similar to the top-level summary, covering different months for each category and element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. When you add entries for a new month, the system dynamically shows that month in the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Funds Balance
Another valuable view is the "funds balance," accessible via a drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This view displays your income, spending, and the remaining balance for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Income entries automatically update this balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Dynamic Filtering Options

The template supports dynamic filtering to help you analyze your data for specific periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
To access filters, locate the three dots that appear when you slide the view to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

*   **Filter by Year:** You can filter the entire data for a particular year, or select a specific year if multiple years are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Filter by Month:** You can also filter the data for a specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This can be done by choosing a month from a drop-down list or by typing in the month (e.g., "Jan") <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. You can choose a specific month for all years or a specific month within a specific year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Funds Balance Filtering:** The funds balance view can also be dynamically filtered by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Customization beyond Filtering

Beyond the built-in filtering, you can customize the currency format for numerical values. By clicking on any number value, selecting "edit property," and then "number format," you can change the currency to your preference from Notion's pre-default options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. For more specific customization needs, you can reach out to the template creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

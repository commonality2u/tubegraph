Managing debt payment transactions involves tracking individual installments and observing their impact on your overall debt. A dedicated debt payment tracker can help visualize progress and ensure accurate record-keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Debt Overview and Setup
Before tracking individual payments, debts are categorized and detailed within a debt overview section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Key information for each debt includes:
*   Debt details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) amount – the amount paid per installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   Interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Initial repayment date – the first installment payment date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Calculated "debt free by" date – an estimate of when the debt will be paid off if repayments continue consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Number of EMIs – total installments required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

Users can add new debt categories (e.g., weekly, quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> or move existing debts between different repayment schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. New debts can be quickly added via an "add details" button, initially appearing in a "no payment frequency" column before being assigned to a specific repayment schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Existing loan details can be edited directly by clicking on the debt field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Tracking Debt Payments
The transaction section is central to [[debt_payment_tracking_and_reporting | tracking debt payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
It displays all debt payments made to date, organized by month with the latest month at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. A quick summation of all EMIs paid for a particular month is also provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Key fields for each payment transaction include:
*   **Paid Status:** A checkbox to mark if an installment has been paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Marking it as paid automatically updates the "paid installment section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. If unticked, it reflects in an "unpaid column section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Payment Date:** The date the payment was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Loan Details:** Allows selection of the specific loan to which the payment applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **EMI Amount of Payment:** The amount paid for that installment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Next Repayment Schedule:** Automatically calculates the next payment due date based on the loan's set payment frequency (e.g., monthly, annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Adding New Payments
A "pay debt amount" button allows users to automatically add a new debt payment entry to the schedule based on the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Once added, users can input details and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Debt Payoff Progress
The [[calculating_debt_payoff_progress | debt payoff progress]] section provides a summary of all loans and the impact of the payments made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This section automatically updates as transaction details are added or changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Key metrics in this section include:
*   Total amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Net payoff in percentage of the total debt paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   "Debt free by" date (integrated for quick reference) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   Total interest amount paid so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Total principal amount repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

Every amount paid towards debt repayment is split into its interest and principal components, which are reported at the bottom of the transaction section and summarized in the progress section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The system consolidates all financial information into one glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Here, you can specify different accounts for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Adding and Managing Income and Expenses
You will find predefined categories like "Salary" and "Side Hustle" under income, and "Groceries," "Utility Bills," and "Netflix" under expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Recording Transactions

After setting up accounts, head to the "Transactions" view to input all your financial activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Transaction Views**: There are five views: "All" (for all transaction types), "Income," "Expenses," "Assets," and "Liabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

    *   **Description**: Add a brief description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

    *   **Account**: Select the specific account (e.g., "Salary" for income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

    *   **Transaction Type**: Select "Inflow" if money is coming into your account (e.g., income), or "Outflow" if money is leaving your account (e.g., expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   **Amount**: Enter the transaction amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

    *   **Net Worth Goal**: Your target amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

## Tracking Investments

The tracker includes an "Investment" tab to monitor your holdings in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.
*   **Setting Up Investment Accounts**: In the "Account" section, under "Assets," add your investment accounts (e.g., "Apple Investment," "Bitcoin Investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
    *   Specify an opening balance and opening units if applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>.
    *   Classify them (e.g., "Stocks," "Crypto") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
    *   Crucially, select "Investments" as the "Asset Class" to enable proper calculation in the investment tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **Recording Investment Transactions**: Go to the "Asset" section under "Transactions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
    *   **Purchases**: Record investment purchases at their cost price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.
    *   **Sales**: When selling an investment, record the transaction at the *cost value* of the units being sold, not the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>. This allows the system to accurately calculate profit or loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>.
*   **Investment Summary**: The "Investment" tab shows the total investment value, units available, and profit or loss from transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. It also displays the investment percentage, showing each investment's contribution to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

## Additional Features and Tips

*   **For Couples**: Couples can use this system by splitting different categories of accounts by individual names (e.g., "Salary by Him," "Side Hustle by Her") to track finances separately within the same system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.
*   **Accessing Specific Transactions**: From the "Finances" summary view, click on any income or expense account (e.g., "Salary"). A "View Transactions" option will appear at the bottom, which automatically populates all transactions related to that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.
*   **Device Availability**: The template is available on all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.
*   **Notion Cost**: Notion itself is a free tool; you only need to sign up with an email ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. There are no extra charges in addition to the template price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.
*   **Multiple Currencies**: Notion supports various currencies. To change the currency, find properties with a dollar sign ($), click to edit, and change the "Number format" to your desired currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. This must be done for all relevant views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.

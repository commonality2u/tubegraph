## Core Settings

### API Key Configuration
Before interacting with the [[using_the_notion_formula_chatbot | Notion Formula Chatbot]], users must provide an OpenAI API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Generation**: An OpenAI key can be generated by clicking the question mark icon within the chatbot's interface, which directs to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   On the OpenAI platform, navigate to "API Keys" on the left menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   Click "Create new secret key," fill in details (e.g., "test key"), and confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   **Important**: Copy the generated key immediately, as it cannot be viewed again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Entry**: Paste the copied API key into the designated field in the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

*   **Free Credit**: New OpenAI accounts typically receive a $5 free credit, usable for testing on platforms like this chatbot, generally limited to the GPT-3.5 Turbo model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

*   **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: An older model that is less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This model is often available with free OpenAI accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

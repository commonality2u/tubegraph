This article demonstrates how to set up and manage debt payment reminders that are delivered via WhatsApp notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These reminders can help ensure timely payment of loans, such as car loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## How Payment Reminders Work

When a debt payment is due, you will receive a WhatsApp notification message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. An example message includes details like:
> "debt payment reminder alert...hi there this is a reminder for payment of car loan which is due on September 23 for an amount of three thousand dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

The message may also include a "pay now" link that redirects you to your bank portal or payment account (e.g., PayPal) to facilitate instant repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Any relevant payment link can be added to the reminder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The entire system is completely [[customizing_payment_reminder_messages | customizable]] to suit specific user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Setting Up Payment Reminder Templates

To receive debt payment reminders on WhatsApp, you first need to [[using_templates_for_loan_reminders | create a template for each loan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Creating a New Template
1.  Click on the "New Template" option from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  Enter the loan details, such as the loan name (e.g., "Car Loan") and the repayment amount (e.g., $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Setting Up Recurring Reminders
Templates can be set to repeat automatically, populating all specified values for a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
1.  Choose to set the repetition on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
2.  Select a specific date (e.g., the 16th) and time each month for the reminder information to be added to the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
3.  Save this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Customizing Notification Timing
You can choose when to receive the notification relative to the actual due date:
*   **Receive early notification**: To get a reminder a certain number of days before the loan's due date (e.g., 7 days prior), enter the number of days into the "days" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This will make the notification date earlier than the due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Receive on due date**: To receive the notification on the same day as the due date, set the field to '0' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Setting a recurring template for each loan will automatically trigger an automation to send the payment notification message to your WhatsApp when it repeats each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This system can be automated for any number of loans you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Deleting Payment Reminder Templates

Once a loan has been fully repaid, you can delete its corresponding template to prevent further recurring notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Simply navigate to the template and delete it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

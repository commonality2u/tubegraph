[[building_a_minimalistic_finance_template_in_notion | Notion Books Freelancers OS]] is a comprehensive dashboard designed for freelancers to manage their finances, including income and expense details, and client management [00:00:09]. This system offers various customization options to adapt it to individual freelancer needs.

## General Customization
Upon downloading the Freelancers OS setup, users land on a dashboard that includes quick instructions. One key instruction explains how to change the currency within the dashboard, with a video demonstration available for guidance [00:00:32].

## Finance Section Customization
The finance section allows freelancers to track their income and expenses [00:00:48].
*   **Income Classification:** Users can add new income and classify it as "client" or create their own custom classifications. This is done by typing a new option directly into the classification field [00:01:57].
*   **Filtering Income:** The "workflow" detail section within the client portal is filtered to display only income classified under "client" [00:04:32]. Users can adjust this filter to show their own custom classifications as needed [00:04:42].

## Client Section Customization
The client section of the dashboard includes several customizable components for managing client interactions and projects. These sections can be edited and customized according to individual requirements [00:21:07].

### Client Details
Clients are categorized into pipelines such as Lead, Negotiation, or Client [00:05:20].
*   **Adding and Editing Client Information:** Users can add new client details [00:05:37]. Individual client entries can be clicked to reveal more details like company, contact, email, position, stage, and website, all of which can be edited [00:07:44]. Users can hide properties that are not relevant to them [00:08:03].
*   **Changing Client Pipeline Status:** Clients can be easily moved between categories (e.g., from 'Client' to 'Negotiating') by simply dragging and dropping their entry into the desired section [00:09:08].

### Project Details
Projects are categorized by priority: Low, Medium, or High [00:10:33].
*   **Adding and Editing Projects:** New projects can be added, and existing project details, such as name, value, and completion date, can be edited [00:10:40].
*   **Customizing Project Status and Priority:** The status of a project (e.g., "not started," "in progress") can be updated [00:12:21]. Users can also redefine existing status names or create new ones by editing the property [00:14:03]. Similarly, project priority can be reassigned (e.g., from low to medium) [00:13:37].
*   **Calculating Project Completion:** Project completion can be calculated in two ways:
    *   **Hourly Basis:** By specifying estimated hours and then tracking actual hours completed [00:14:45].
    *   **Invoicing Basis:** By tracking the total project value against the invoiced amount [00:15:06]. Users can choose the preferred method [00:16:11].

### Services
Services are categorized by their status: Not Started, In Progress, or Completed [00:17:57].
*   **Adding and Customizing Services:** Users can add new services and define their pricing structure (e.g., hourly basis or fixed flat rate fees) [00:18:27]. These pricing options can be modified or new ones can be added [00:18:32].
*   **Updating Service Status:** Services can be moved between categories to reflect their current status [00:19:06].

### Invoicing
Invoices are categorized by status: Draft, Sent, or Paid [00:21:17].
*   **Adding and Managing Invoices:** New invoices can be added, and their numbers, amounts, and due dates can be set [00:22:07]. The invoice amount can be automatically populated from the workflow section [00:22:29].
*   **Workflow Integration:** The workflow section at the bottom of the client portal connects income entries from the finance section with invoices, clients, projects, and services [00:23:08]. This allows for a seamless flow of information where adding details in the workflow automatically updates the relevant sections above [00:25:06]. Users can also create new invoices, clients, projects, or services directly from the workflow section if they choose [00:25:41].
*   **Payment Mode:** Users can track the payment mode (e.g., "Bank") for invoices to reflect received payments, which automatically updates finance calculations [00:27:36].

## Tool Section Customization
The "Tools" section provides additional functionalities to enhance business operations.

### Resources
Resources are categorized into Checklists, Guides, Strategies, or Tips [00:29:07].
*   **Creating Custom Resources:** Users can create new resources under existing or new categories (e.g., "Taxes," "Budgeting," "Investments," "Savings") [00:29:37]. Each resource allows for notes, links, and the creation of to-do lists or other structured information using Notion's block features [00:30:08].

### Contacts
Contacts can be categorized by the service they provide (e.g., Finance, Legal) [00:31:35].
*   **Adding and Categorizing Contacts:** Users can add contact details (name, designation, phone, address, email, company name) and create their own custom categories for contacts [00:32:23].

### Goals
Goals are categorized into Health, Wealth, and Relationship [00:33:14].
*   **Setting and Tracking Goals:** Users can add new goals, specify a target achievement date, and track progress using target and achieved numbers [00:33:23]. The completion percentage is automatically calculated based on these inputs [00:34:01].

### Calendar
The calendar view displays scheduled meetings [00:34:26].
*   **Scheduling and Customizing Meetings:** Users can add new meetings, including title, agenda, assigned client or contact, and meeting medium (e.g., Google Meet) [00:34:44]. New meeting mediums can be created [00:35:39]. Meeting priority (low, medium, high) can be assigned and edited [00:36:04].
*   **Changing Calendar View:** The calendar view can be customized to show a weekly or monthly overview [00:36:27].

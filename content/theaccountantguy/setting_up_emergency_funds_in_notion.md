This article explains how to utilize a Notion template designed to [[using_notion_for_budgeting_and_savings | track your emergency funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template, which serves as a [[setting_up_a_savings_funds_dashboard_in_notion | savings funds dashboard]], features three main sections: Fund Setup, Savings Overview, and a Summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Template Sections Overview

The template's top section provides a summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
*   **Fund Setup**: Where you define your emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Savings Overview**: Provides an overview of all savings made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Summary Section**: Reflects all savings and necessary contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The Fund Setup section allows you to define and manage individual emergency funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Categories
Funds are organized into categories. By default, there are three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>:
*   Financial Safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Asset Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Health and Wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

You can edit existing categories or add new ones by clicking on the category name or the "add a group" button respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Adding a New Fund
To add a new fund, click the "add font" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A new fund will appear under a "no classification" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. You can then move it to a specific category using the three-dot menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Editing Fund Details
Click the pencil icon next to a fund to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
*   **Fund Detail**: A descriptive name for the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Starting Balance**: The initial amount in the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: The targeted savings amount for this specific emergency fund, enabling [[creating_and_editing_savings_goals_in_notion | savings goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Start Date**: The date you begin contributing to this fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This helps calculate savings made to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Target End Date**: The date by which you aim to have the total emergency fund available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, also part of [[creating_and_editing_savings_goals_in_notion | setting savings goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Contributions Section

This section is where you [[allocating_funds_using_notion | put money for savings]] towards each emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Contributions are divided by month, with the latest month appearing on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Each contribution entry includes:
*   **Date**: The date of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Description**: A brief description of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Period**: The month and year of the contribution (predefined for 2023, customizable for other years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Fund**: Select the specific emergency fund to which the contribution is being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The amount of savings or contribution for the specific month towards the chosen fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Requirement**: Automatically calculates how much contribution is needed each month to meet the fund's goal amount by its target end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. A tick mark indicates if the monthly requirement has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Adding Contributions with Quick Action
It is recommended to use the "quick action" button to add new line items, as it automatically includes necessary formulas and links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Clicking it adds a new line item for the current month and date, which can then be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Quarterly Overview

This section provides a glance view of all contributions grouped by quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. It shows:

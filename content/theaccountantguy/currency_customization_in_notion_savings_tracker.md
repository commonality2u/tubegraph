The Notion savings funds tracker can be used with different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Changing Currency Settings
To change the currency within the tracker:
1.  Click on any amount property that displays a dollar currency symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  Select "Edit property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
3.  Within the "Number format" option, you will find a list of all supported currencies in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

If you require assistance in [[customizing_notion_templates_for_financial_tracking | setting up this template]] with a different currency after purchase, support is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This feature makes the tracker completely dynamic and adaptable to your specific financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

To [[formulas_for_multiplication_in_notion | calculate the product]] of two numbers in a Notion database, you can use two different formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This process involves setting up a database with specific number properties and then applying [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] to compute the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Database Setup

A typical database for this operation consists of:
*   A "Name" property (title property), which can be used to identify the operator, e.g., "multiply operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Two "Number" properties, each assigned a number format, to hold the values you want to multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Formula properties to display the calculated product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Methods for Multiplication

There are two primary ways to calculate the product of two numbers using formulas in Notion:

### 1. Using the `multiply()` operator formula

This method involves explicitly using the `multiply()` function within a Notion formula property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Syntax**: `multiply(Number1, Number2)`
*   You provide the two numbers as inputs to this formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Example**: If you input `2` and `3` into the number properties, the `multiply()` formula will return `6` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol (`*`)

This is a more direct approach, using the asterisk symbol (`*`) to perform multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Syntax**: `Number1 * Number2`
*   The multiply symbol is placed between the two number properties you wish to multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Both formulas effectively calculate the product of two numbers in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This article details how to [[calculating_product_of_numbers_in_notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] within a database in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This can be achieved using two distinct [[formulas_in_notion | formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Database Setup

To calculate products, a Notion database needs the following properties:
*   A title property for the name of the operator (e.g., "multiply operator") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Two number properties for the input values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   A formula property to display the calculated product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Methods for Calculating Product

Notion offers two ways to [[calculating_product_of_numbers_in_notion | calculate the product of numbers]] within a database:

### 1. Using the Multiply Operator Formula

This method involves a dedicated "multiply operator" formula where the two numbers are provided as input to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   For example, if the input numbers are 2 and 3, the product obtained using this formula is 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol (`*`)

Another formula allows for the multiplication of two numbers simply by placing the multiply symbol (`*`) between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Both of these [[formulas_in_notion | formulas]] enable the calculation of the product of two numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

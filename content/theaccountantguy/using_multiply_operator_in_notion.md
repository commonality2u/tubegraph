Notion databases can be used to [[calculating_product_of_two_numbers_in_notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] within a database property using formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Database Setup

To calculate the product of two numbers, a database typically consists of:
*   A "Name" property (often a title property) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Two distinct "Number" properties assigned to each number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   Formula properties to perform the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Methods for Multiplication

There are two primary [[formulas_for_multiplication_in_notion | formulas for multiplication]] using the multiply operator in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>:

### 1. Using the `multiply` Operator Formula

This method uses the explicit `multiply` operator in a formula property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. You provide the two number properties as input to this formula to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol (`*`)

This method uses the asterisk (`*`) as the [[using_symbols_in_notion_formulas | multiply symbol]] placed between the two number properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It's a more concise way to perform the multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Example

If you input the numbers 2 and 3 into the respective number properties, both methods will return a product of 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

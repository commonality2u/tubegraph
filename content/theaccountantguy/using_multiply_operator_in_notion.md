To [[multiplying_numbers_in_notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] within a database in Notion, you can employ two distinct [[using_formulas_in_notion | formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Database Setup
A Notion database created for this purpose typically consists of at least two [[properties_of_numbers_in_notion | number properties]] and a formula property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **Title Property:** Used for the name of the operator, such as "multiply operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Number Properties:** Two separate properties, each assigned a [[properties_of_numbers_in_notion | number property]], to hold the input values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Formula Property:** This property is used to calculate and display the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Methods for Calculating Product

### 1. Using the `multiply` Operator Formula
The `multiply` operator formula allows you to provide two numbers as input to calculate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

For example, if you input `2` and `3` as the numbers, the `multiply` operator formula will yield `6` as the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol (`*`)
Another method involves a simpler [[using_formulas_in_notion | formula]] that directly multiplies the two numbers by placing the multiply symbol (`*`) in between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Both methods effectively [[multiplying_numbers_in_notion | calculate the product of two numbers]] in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

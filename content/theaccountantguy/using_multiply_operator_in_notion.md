This article explains how to [[calculating_product_of_numbers_in_notion|calculate the product of two numbers]] within a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The product can be calculated using two distinct [[formulas_for_multiplication_in_notion|formulas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Database Setup

A database for this purpose consists of two number properties to hold the input values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Additionally, there is a title property, typically used for the name of the operator, such as "multiply operator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Methods for Multiplication

Two primary [[using_formulas_in_notion|formulas]] can be utilized to calculate the product of numbers in Notion:

### 1. Using the Multiply Operator Formula

This method involves a specific `multiply operator formula` where the two numbers are provided as inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This formula directly calculates their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### 2. Using the Multiply Symbol (`*`)

Alternatively, you can multiply two numbers by simply placing the `*` (multiply symbol) between them in a formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Example

For instance, if the input numbers are 2 and 3, using either of these [[formulas_for_multiplication_in_notion|formulas]] will result in a product of 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

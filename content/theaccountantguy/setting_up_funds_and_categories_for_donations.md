The Charity Donation Tracker allows users to track donations towards various charities by organizing them into categories and individual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The tracker is divided into three main sections: Fund Setup, Donations Overview, and Summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Fund Setup

The Fund Setup section is where users [[overview_of_fund_categories_and_customization | customize fund categories and set up individual donation funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Donation Categories

Donations are initially divided into three default categories: Health, Environment, and Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

*   **Editing Existing Categories:** Users can edit existing categories by clicking on them and typing a new name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories:** To add a new category, slide the bottom slider to the right to reveal a plus icon, then click it to create a new group/category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Individual Donation Funds

Within each category, different funds are set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. For example, under "Health," there are "American Red Cross," "WHO," and "Care" funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

*   **Adding New Funds:**
    1.  Click the "add funds" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    2.  A new fund will be created without classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
    3.  Slide to the right to see the newly added fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    4.  Click the three dots next to the new fund and move it to the desired category (e.g., Education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Editing Fund Details:** Once a fund is placed in a category, click the pencil icon to edit its details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   **Name:** Enter the name of the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   **Opening Balance:** Input the amount of donations made to this fund at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Targeted Donation:** Set the total donation amount you aim to contribute to this specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   **Start Date:** Specify when you began donating to this fund (e.g., January 1, 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   **Target Date:** Set the end goal date by which you aim to reach the targeted donation amount (e.g., December 31st) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

> [!INFO] Managing Donation Goals and Timelines
> The "Targeted Donation," "Start Date," and "Target Date" fields are crucial for [[managing_donation_goals_and_timelines | managing donation goals and timelines]], as they inform calculations for recommended monthly contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

*   **Deleting Funds:** To delete an added fund, click the three dots next to it and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Linking Recent Donations to Funds

When making a donation, users select the appropriate fund from those added in the Fund Setup section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This links the donation to the specific fund's tracking and calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Donations Overview

The Donations Overview section provides a specific donation-wise overview of all funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. It shows:
*   Total donations made for each fund (including opening balance and subsequent donations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   The percentage of the targeted amount reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   Months remaining until the target date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   The contribution required per month to reach the targeted donation amount by the end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

The values displayed in this section are flexible and can be changed to show different necessary figures, such as contribution per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Summary

The Summary section provides a quick overview of overall donation progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. It shows:
*   The total donation required (summation of all fund requirements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   The total donations made so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   The shortfall from the targeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   The percentage of total donation requirement met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Currency Customization

The entire dashboard can be set up in any currency of the user's choice, as Notion supports many different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. A separate video resource is available to guide users on [[customizing_donation_tracker_with_currency_options | how to change currency settings]] within the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

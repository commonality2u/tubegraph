This article explains how to utilize a travel expense tracker to monitor and plan [[classifying_and_managing_travel_expenses | travel expenses]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The tracker provides a summary section including accounts, expenses, and an overall summary of all expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Setting Up Expense Categories (Accounts View)

The initial step in managing expenses is [[setting_up_expense_categories_in_notion | setting up expense categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Expenses are classified under broad categories like "travel," "meals," and "lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Any expense incurred will be booked under one of these [[defining_expense_categories_in_notion | defined categories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Sources
To quickly add a new expense source, such as "Metro," click "add expense source," which automatically adds it to the travel category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The details of this new source can then be edited by clicking the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For each expense source, a budgeted amount can be set, for example, $1,500 for "Metro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Moving and Customizing Categories
Expense sources can be moved to different categories; for instance, a newly added source can be placed under the "meals" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. To add an entirely new category, click the plus sign on the right to create a new group separate from existing ones like "travel," "meals," and "lodging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Existing groups can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Monitoring Expenses (Expenses View)

After [[setting_budget_categories | setting up accounts]] for travel expenses, the "expenses" view displays the total expenses incurred, the budgeted expense for that category, and the percentage spent relative to the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

For example:
*   A flight expense of $2,000 against a $1,000 budget shows 200% spent, indicated in red, signifying an exceeded budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Breakfast expenses of $100 against a $300 budget show 33% spent, indicated in green, signifying it's within the budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This view provides a quick [[expense_categorization_and_analysis | one-glance view]] of where expenses stand within different categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Overall Summary

The "summary" section offers a complete overview, displaying the total budgeted expense, total incurred expense, the difference between the two, and the overall percentage of budgeted expense that has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. For instance, if $3,600 has been incurred out of a $6,800 budget, it reflects that 59% of the budgeted expense has been reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Booking Expenses

To book expenses, the tracker utilizes the same three categories: travel, meals, and lodging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Quick addition buttons allow users to add specific expenses easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Adding New Expense Entries
Clicking "add travel expense" (or similar for other categories) automatically adds a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Users can then add:
*   A description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   Trip info (e.g., "trip to Paris"), which can be edited later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   The expense account (e.g., train, bus, flight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   The amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Once an expense is booked, such as $100 for a train, it immediately reflects in the "expenses" summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. If a budgeted expense was set (e.g., $200 for train), the tracker shows the percentage spent (e.g., 50%) and indicates if it's within the budget (in green) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This system for [[expense_categories_and_budget_management | expense categories and budget management]] allows users to understand their financial standing and plan future expenses effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The use of [[customizing_categories_in_notion_expense_tracker | customized categories]] aids in [[managing_different_types_of_business_expenses | managing different types of business expenses]] or personal expenditures.

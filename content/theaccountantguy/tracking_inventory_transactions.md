The "Home Inventory Tracker" is a simple template designed to help users [[managing_investments_and_inventory_in_business | keep track of all home inventory]] in one centralized location [00:00:02].

## Overview of the Home Inventory Tracker

This tracker provides a comprehensive view of home inventory, with key metrics and sections for detailed management:
*   **Left Side Metrics**
    *   Total estimated purchases [00:00:09]
    *   Total purchases already made [00:00:11]
    *   The difference between estimated and actual purchases [00:00:12]
    *   The total percentage of purchases made relative to the estimated budget [00:00:14]

## Inventory Categories and Subcategories

The right side of the tracker features distinct sections for organizing inventory:
*   **Inventory Categories**
    *   Users can establish different categories for their inventory [00:00:20].
    *   Examples of categories include "Darian eggs," "medicines," and "fruits and veggies" [00:00:23].
    *   Each category lists specific subcategories [00:00:28].
    *   An estimated budgeted purchase amount is associated with each subcategory [00:00:30].

## Inventory Overview

The "Inventory Overview" section provides critical information about the stock:
*   Total purchases made [00:00:35]
*   Consumption units [00:00:37]
*   Availability units [00:00:39]
*   The percentage of total units consumed [00:00:40]

This overview is applicable to all listed subcategory items [00:00:43].

## Transaction Management

The "Transaction Section" allows for detailed [[tracking_transactions_and_entering_transactions_in_a_business_expense_tracker | tracking and entering transactions]] related to inventory [00:00:48]. This section enables users to specify every inventory transaction that occurs [00:00:50].

### Recording Purchases
*   Users can record specific purchases, such as "cheese purchase" [00:00:53].
*   Clicking on an item allows viewing and selecting different subcategory items [00:00:56].
*   The amount of purchases made can be recorded [00:01:00].

### Recording Consumption
*   Entries can be added to indicate when an item, like cheese, is consumed [00:01:04].
*   A dedicated column, "items used," allows users to specify the number of items consumed [00:01:09].

### Automated Updates
Once transaction entries are made, the system automatically updates all relevant subsections [00:01:14]. This functionality helps users [[inventory_tracking_for_small_businesses | keep a track of available inventory]] and the consumption required for each item in their home [00:01:19].

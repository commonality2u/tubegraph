The budgeting tracker template offers various options for viewing and filtering financial data, providing an overview of your budgeting progress and financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Components Overview

The tracker includes five main [[components_of_the_budget_tracker | components]]: Income, Expense, Debt, Bills, and Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For each of these components, you can specify a targeted or budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

On the left side of the screen, an overview of all different elements for each component is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. By selecting a component from a drop-down menu (e.g., "Income overview"), you can see a breakdown of categories within that component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For income, this includes the specific income amount, the set goal amount, and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For expense sources, it shows the targeted amount and the expense incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

A percentage indicates how much of the budgeted amount has been incurred as an expense, and a "budget status" shows whether you have stayed within or exceeded the [[managing_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | budgeted amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This applies to all five components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Monthly Overview

At the bottom of the tracker, a [[monthly_and_yearly_budget_overviews | monthly overview]] provides a month-wise division of financial data for each category and element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. For example, for expenses, it displays categories like "food," "entertainment," and "shopping," showing their status for specific months (e.g., Jan 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. When new entries are made for a different month, the monthly overview automatically updates and displays the new month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Filtering Data

The monthly overview section offers dynamic filtering capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. You can click on the three dots to add filters and view data for:
*   **Specific Years** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>: Filter the entire data set for a particular year, such as 2024, to see all values for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Specific Months** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>: Filter by a particular month (e.g., January), which can display data for that month across all years or for a specific year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

This flexibility allows you to specifically collate and track your financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Funds Balance

Within the drop-down menu, you can select "Funds Balance" to view your financial summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This section shows the total income and spendings for each month, as well as the remaining balance at the end of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This view updates automatically as you enter income and [[expense_analysis_and_budgeting | expense]] entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The spendings amount is derived from all expense, debt, and bill payments, while income is from income sources, offering a quick glance at your account balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This view can also be filtered dynamically by year and month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

[[introduction_to_pdfoutput_tool | PDFOutput]] is a tool designed to generate PDF documents directly from a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This article focuses on understanding the different subscription plans and features available within the [[using_pdfoutput_features_and_settings | PDFOutput]] service.

## Basic Plan
Upon starting with [[introduction_to_pdfoutput_tool | PDFOutput]], users are on a basic plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Basic Plan Limitations
*   **Watermark**: Documents generated on the free plan will display a watermark on the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Document Limit**: The basic plan allows for the generation of up to 1,000 documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **No Expiry**: The basic plan does not have an expiry date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Upgrading Your Subscription
Once the 1,000 file limit is reached on the basic plan, users need to upgrade their subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The upgrade option is accessible through the "Upgrade" button in the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Paid Plans
[[subscription_and_plan_options_in_pdf_output | PDFOutput]] offers multiple pricing plans, including Pro and Enterprise plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Users can choose between monthly and yearly billing options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Benefits of Paid Plans
*   **Watermark Removal**: Any of the paid plans will remove the watermark from generated PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Increased Limits**: Paid plans offer higher document generation limits tailored to different requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Activation**: After upgrading, the subscription needs to be activated within the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Key Features of PDFOutput
[[using_pdf_output_interface_for_exporting_documents | PDFOutput]] provides several features to facilitate the generation of PDF documents:

### Notion Integration
*   **Database Selection**: Users can select a Notion database from a list of connected databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Template Selection**: A Notion template can be selected for creating the PDF document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **API Key Setup**:
    *   **Private Integration Key**: Currently, users need to set up a Notion private integration key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Each user must create their own unique key for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Public API Key (Future)**: The possibility of Notion public API key access is mentioned for future use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Database & Template Connection**: Both the Notion database and template must be connected to the API integration by clicking the three dots on the top right in Notion and selecting "Connect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **PDF Status Property**: A "PDF status" property in the Notion database is used to track generated PDFs. Keeping it unchecked indicates a PDF needs to be generated for that row of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Document Generation
*   **Template Placeholders**: Templates use curly brackets `{}` for placeholder text elements (e.g., `{client name}`, `{invoice number}`) that are replaced by data from the Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Automatic Mapping**: [[customizing_and_exporting_pdf_documents_with_pdf_output_tool | PDFOutput]] automatically maps Notion database properties to template elements, especially if naming conventions match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Unmapped properties appear in gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> and can be manually mapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Page Format**: Users can specify the page format for the PDF output, with A4 being recommended for best results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Output and Management
*   **Preview**: Users can preview generated PDF documents directly on the web interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Download**: Generated PDFs can be downloaded individually or all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Saved Connections**: Once a connection (database, template, API key) is set up, it can be saved and reloaded later without re-specifying details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Additional Features
*   **Templates Section**: A dedicated "Templates" section is planned to offer more pre-built templates in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Feedback Window**: Users can submit feedback directly to the developer to help improve the tool's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Help Window**: A help window is available, which will include tutorial videos for user reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:12:02]</a>.

A Notion expenses tracker allows users to manage all their expenses in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This template is designed for [[comparison_of_actual_vs_budgeted_expenses | comparing actual vs budgeted expenses]] and can be used for both personal and [[budgeting_and_tracking_business_expenses | business expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Expense Categories

The tracker features a category section at the top, which initially includes three predefined categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. These categories are customizable to individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Managing Categories
*   **Renaming**: Hovering over a category reveals a pencil icon. Clicking this icon allows users to rename a category to their preference, such as "my category" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Editing/Deleting**: Three dots appearing near a category allow for editing or deleting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories**: A "new page" option enables the addition of new categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Each category within the tracker displays both a "budgeted expense amount" and an "actual expense amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Setting Budgeted Amounts
Users can [[setting_budgeted_amounts_for_business_expenses | set their own budgeted expenses]] for each category by clicking on the "budget expense amount" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. For example, the total budget can be set to $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Tracking Expenses

Below the categories, expenses are listed in a table format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. As amounts are entered into this table, the categories are automatically updated with the respective expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This real-time update allows for efficient [[monthly_budget_tracking | monthly budget tracking]] and [[managing_budgeted_vs_actual_expenses | managing budgeted vs actual expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Summary Section

The summary section provides a comprehensive overview of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It includes:
*   The total [[budget_and_actual_expenses_comparison | budgeted expense amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   The total actual expenses amount, which is computed directly from the expense table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   The difference between the budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   The percentage of the budget that has been spent so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

When budgeted figures are changed, the summary section automatically updates to reflect the new totals and related figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

This template is fully customizable to suit various [[expense_analysis_and_budgeting | expense analysis and budgeting]] needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

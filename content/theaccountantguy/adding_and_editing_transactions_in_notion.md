This article details how to manage your financial transactions using a Notion Net Worth Tracker, developed to help individuals, freelancers, and small business owners manage their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The tracker is part of a range of templates available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Overview of the Net Worth Tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

The net worth tracker is organized into three main sections:
*   **Get Started:** Where you set your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Account:** For specifying different [[using_categories_and_transactions_in_notion | accounts]] (e.g., [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | expenses]], [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | income]], [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | assets]], and [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | liabilities]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Summary:** Provides an [[overview_and_transaction_management_in_notion | overview]] of your entire finances, displaying [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | account]] balances and proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It also includes a net worth section calculating your goal, total net worth, difference, growth, and percentage achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Transactions View:** Where you input all your [[managing_transactions_using_notion_for_small_businesses | income]], [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | expenses]], and details related to [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | assets]] and [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | liabilities]] to calculate your net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>

Before recording [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | transactions]], you need to set up your [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | accounts]].

### Setting Your Net Worth Goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

Under the "Get Started" view, specify your net worth goal. You can click on the amount (e.g., $10,000 default) and edit it to your desired value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Changing this value automatically updates the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Adding New Accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

In the "Account" section, you can add new [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | accounts]] by scrolling down and clicking the "New" button displayed under each category (Income, Expense, Asset, Liability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

When adding a new [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | account]] (e.g., "Interest [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | Income]]") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, you'll fill in the following:
*   **Name:** The name of the [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | account]] (e.g., "Interest [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | Income]]") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance:** The value you have at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This is typically left blank for [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | income]] and [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | expenses]], but applicable for [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | assets]] and [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | liabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Classification:** Assign a tag or [[using_categories_and_transactions_in_notion | category]] to the [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | account]] (e.g., "Groceries" under "Bills," "Netflix" under "Subscription") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. You can add your own [[adding_and_deleting_categories_in_notion | categories]] or use existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency:** How often the payment for this [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | account]] occurs (e.g., monthly for salary, quarterly for interest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. You can also input custom frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Opening Units:** Used for [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | investments]] (e.g., 10 units of Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This should be left blank for [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | income]] and [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Asset Class:** For [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | investments]], classify as "Investments." For other [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | accounts]], leave blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Editing Existing Accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
To edit an already added [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | account]], click on the pencil icon next to it. This will open an edit window where you can modify the values or descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. These values are entirely customizable and can be edited anytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Adding and Editing Transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>

The [[detailing_the_transaction_section_in_notion | transaction]] section has four different views: Income, Expense, Asset, and Liabilities, along with an "All" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

*   **Finances View:** Shows current [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | expenses]], [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | income]], [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | assets]], and [[setting_budgets_and_recording_transactions_in_notion | liabilities]], including their specific amounts and proportions of the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Net Worth View:** Provides key statistical figures:
    *   **Net Worth Goal:** The goal you set earlier (e.g., $14,000, which can be changed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

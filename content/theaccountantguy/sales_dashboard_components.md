This article provides an overview of the components within the Sales Performance OS, a Notion template designed for [[sales_performance_tracking | sales performance tracking]] and overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The system's primary dashboard offers a comprehensive view of sales activities and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Main Dashboard Components

The top section of the sales dashboard features three primary components, each providing monthly insights into sales performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>:

### Salesperson Performance

This component tracks the sales made by individual salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For each person and month (e.g., December stats), it displays four key metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>:
*   **Sales Achieved:** The total sales made for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Targeted Sales:** The sales goal set for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Targeted Sales:** How much of the target they have achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Target Status:** Indicates "Target achieved" if sales exceed the target, or "Target not achieved" if they fall below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Sales Channel Performance

This section represents sales made through various sources (e.g., website, Instagram, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Like salesperson data, it is bifurcated by month and displays achieved sales, targeted sales, percentage achieved, and status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Users can add their own custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Sales Location Performance

This component details sales made to different geographical locations, showing the same performance characteristics as the salesperson and sales channel views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Sales Overview Sections

On the left side of the dashboard, dedicated overview sections provide aggregated data:

*   **Salesperson Overview:** Shows total sales made by each individual, the number of sale units sold, and the average sales (sale per unit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Sales Channel Overview:** Displays total sales, sale units, and average sales for each different sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Sales Location Overview:** Presents total sales, average sales, and sale units for each location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

These overview sections help track and provide a holistic view of business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Sales Transactions

Below the main dashboard components, a section allows for the entry of sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This acts as the data input for the dashboard views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

For each transaction, users can input:
*   **Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   **Account Details:** Pertaining to the salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Sales Detail:** Information about what is being sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Month and Year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Salesperson Detail:** Linked to the salesperson window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Client Detail:** Information about the client to whom the sale was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Sales Code:** A unique code specific to each individual sale (e.g., "J. Carter_Dec23" for James Carter's December 2023 sale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Sales Target:** Set at the start of the month for each person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Sales Amount:** The actual amount of sales made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Sales Unit:** The number of units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Similar input processes exist for sales channels and locations, where targeted sales amounts can be specified at the start of the month, along with unique referral or location codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Once details are entered in the salesperson window, other related information like channel and referral code will automatically update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Quick Action Buttons

On the left panel, quick action buttons facilitate data management:
*   **Sales Target:** Automatically assigns a target for a particular month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This applies to salespeople, channels, and locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Add Transaction:** Used to directly enter new sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Customization and Filtering

The [[using_notion_for_sales_performance_overview | Notion dashboard]] is fully customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Users can:
*   **Edit Details:** Modify salesperson names or other details by clicking on their entries, which opens a new window for editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Users can also set custom cover images for entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Create New Months/Years:** Add new months or years for tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Enter Client Information:** Input detailed client information, including address, city, and state, via a dedicated client dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Change Currency:** The currency symbol for the entire dashboard can be changed from dollar to any preferred currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This is done by editing the property and changing the number format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Filter Data:** Apply filters to view data for specific years or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Users can combine filters (e.g., all months of a particular year) to analyze sales performance in more detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

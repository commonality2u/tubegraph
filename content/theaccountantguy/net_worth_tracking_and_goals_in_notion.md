This article explains how to [[building_a_net_worth_tracker_using_notion | track your net worth]] and set financial goals using a personal finance tracker setup in [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | Notion]].

## Overview of Net Worth Tracking

The [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | Notion]] tracker includes a net worth section that provides a total overview of the net worth achieved so far and how much you might be lagging behind your target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Net worth is calculated as the difference between your assets and liabilities after all transactions have been entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

## Setting Your Net Worth Goal

To begin, you need to specify your net worth target for the entire financial year in the "Net Worth Goal" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. This target can be easily changed at any time by clicking on its value and entering a new amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

## Tracking Net Worth in the Summary View

Once transactions are recorded, the "Net Worth" section under the "Summary" view reflects all relevant figures at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>:

*   **Net Worth Goal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>
*   **Total Net Worth:** This is calculated as the total assets minus total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. For example, if total assets are \$5,630 and liabilities are \$1,300, the net worth is \$4,330 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
*   **Difference:** This shows how much you are lagging behind your net worth goal from the current net worth position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. It's the net worth goal minus the total net worth achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
*   **Percentage Achieved:** This indicates the percentage of your net worth goal that has been achieved so far, calculated as total net worth divided by the net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **Total Growth:** This is the difference between the closing net worth and the opening net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

### Opening Balances

The opening net worth for the "Total Growth" calculation is derived from the opening balances specified for all assets and liabilities in the "Account" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. For instance, if the total opening asset balance was \$1,900 and liabilities were \$900, the opening net worth would be \$1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. Any changes to these opening balances will be reflected in the overall net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

## Tracking for Couples

This [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_using_notion | Notion]] dashboard is also applicable for couples looking to [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | track their finances]] together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. In the "Account" section, individuals can split categories of accounts (e.g., salary, side hustle, expenses, assets, liabilities) by adding "by him" or "by her" to denote income or expenses for each person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. This allows for joint tracking while distinguishing individual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

## Template Features

This [[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | Notion]] template is available across all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Notion itself is a free tool for basic use, requiring only an email ID to sign up, meaning no extra charges are involved beyond the template's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.

### Multi-Currency Support

[[setting_up_a_personal_finance_tracker_in_notion | Notion]] supports multiple currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. To change the currency display, locate any field with a dollar sign (or current currency symbol), click on it, select "Edit property," go to "Number format," and choose your desired currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. This change will update the currency symbol across the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>. This process needs to be repeated for all relevant views (e.g., transactions, net worth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

Notion provides highly [[customizing_notion_templates | customizable templates]] for various purposes, including [[creating_and_managing_budgets_in_Notion | budget management]]. One such example is the Film Production Budget Tracker, designed to help users monitor expenses related to film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This template, like other [[customizing_notion_finance_templates | Notion finance templates]], allows for significant personalization to meet specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Template Overview and Structure
The Film Production Budget Tracker template features a table that lists individual expenses, along with their respective categories and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. A summary section provides an [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | overview]] of financial data, including budgeted expenses, actual expenses, the difference between the two, and the percentage of actual expenses relative to the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. All values within the template automatically update when changes are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Customizing Categories
A key aspect of [[customizing_the_notion_expense_tracker_template | customizing the Notion expense tracker template]] is the ability to manage expense categories:
*   **Defining Categories** You can click on a pencil icon within the category field to define or redefine categories. These changes will update across the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories** New categories can be added by clicking on the "new page" option within the category section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Editing Categories** Existing categories can be edited by clicking the pencil icon next to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Deleting Categories** Categories can be deleted by clicking the three-dot icon and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Customizing Expense Values
Users can directly update budgeted expense values within the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Similarly, actual expense amounts can be entered, and these values will update the summary figures automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

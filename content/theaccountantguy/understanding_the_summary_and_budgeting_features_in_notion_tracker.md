The [[how_to_build_an_expense_tracker_in_notion | Notion expenses tracker]] is designed to consolidate all your expenses in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This template is versatile and can be used for various needs, including [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | personal expenses]] or [[tracking_personal_finances_using_notion | business expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It is fully customizable to meet your specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Category-Level Budgeting

Within the tracker, there is a dedicated category section at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Each category can be customized to your specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For every category, you will find:
*   **Budgeted Expense Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   **Actual Expense Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

### Managing Categories
*   **Renaming:** Hover over a category to reveal a pencil icon. Clicking this icon allows you to rename the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. After renaming, press Enter to save the change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Editing/Deleting:** To edit or delete a category, click on the three dots next to it and select "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Adding New Categories:** Click on "new page" to add a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Setting Budgeted Expenses
You can set your desired budgeted expense for each category by clicking on the budgeted expense amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Changes made here will instantly update the total budget displayed in the summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Tracking Actual Expenses
As you enter expense amounts, the actual expense figures for the corresponding categories are automatically updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Summary Section
The summary section provides an [[overview_of_notion_budget_tracker_template | overall view]] of your financial tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It includes:
*   **Budgeted Expense Amount:** This reflects the total budget you've set across all categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Actual Expenses Amount:** This is computed from the detailed expense entries in the table below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Difference:** The variance between your budgeted and actual expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Budget Expense Spent:** This indicates how much of your total budget has been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

All figures in the summary section automatically update as you modify budget amounts or enter new expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

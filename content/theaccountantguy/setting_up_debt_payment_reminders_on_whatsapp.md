This guide demonstrates how to [[setting_up_debt_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp|set up debt payment reminders]] that arrive as notifications on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These alerts are triggered on the due date of a loan payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## How the Reminder Works

A typical WhatsApp reminder message includes a "debt payment reminder alert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. For example, a car loan reminder might state that a payment for $3,000 is due on September 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The message also includes a payment link, such as a "pay now" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Clicking this link redirects the user to their bank portal or a payment service like PayPal to instantly repay the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Any relevant payment link can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Setting Up Payment Reminders

To receive [[automating_loan_repayment_notifications|loan repayment notifications]] on WhatsApp, the primary step is to [[creating_templates_for_recurring_payment_reminders|create a template for each loan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. These templates are fully modifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Creating a Loan Template

1.  **Initiate a New Template:** Select the "new template" option from a drop-down menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  **Input Loan Details:** Enter loan specifics, such as "car loan" and the repayment amount of $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
3.  **Set Repetition:** For each new template, there is an option to set repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This feature automatically populates all values given in the template for a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   **Frequency:** Set the repetition to occur, for instance, on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   **Day and Time:** Specify the day of the month (e.g., 16th) and a specific time for the information to repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This means every 16th of the month, this loan item will be automatically added to the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
4.  **Define Notification Date:**
    *   The system can be set to send a notification a certain number of days before the actual due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, by typing "7" for "days," a notification will be received seven days prior to the loan's repayment due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   If the notification date should be the same as the due date, set this value to "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Once a recurring template is set for each loan, such as a car loan, it will repeat monthly on the specified date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This repetition automatically triggers an automation to send the payment notification message to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Automating Notifications

After setting up [[creating_recurring_payment_reminders|recurring payment reminders]], an automation is configured to send WhatsApp notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. For example, a new loan named "education loan" can be set to appear at a specific time (e.g., 3:55 PM on September 16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. When this new loan automatically populates in the database, a payment alert message is triggered and sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This process can be [[automating_loan_repayment_notifications|automated for any number of loans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Customization and Management

Users can [[creating_templates_for_recurring_payment_reminders|create custom messages]] according to their preferences, as the system is fully customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Once a loan has been repaid, its associated template can be deleted to prevent further repetitions and notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

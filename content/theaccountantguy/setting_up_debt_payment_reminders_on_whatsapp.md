This guide demonstrates how to set up [[automating_loan_payment_notifications | debt payment reminders]] that arrive directly on your WhatsApp, providing a timely notification on the due date of a loan payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This system allows for [[customizing_reminder_alerts_in_whatsapp | customized messages]] and includes direct payment links for instant repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## How WhatsApp Debt Payment Reminders Work

When a debt payment is due, you will receive a notification message on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. For instance, a car loan due on September 23 for $3,000 would trigger an alert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

The reminder message typically includes:
*   A "debt payment reminder alert" header <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   Details like the loan type (e.g., car loan), due date, and amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   A "pay now" button or link that redirects you to your bank portal or chosen payment platform (e.g., PayPal) for instant repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Any relevant payment link can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## [[step_by_step_guide_for_whatsapp_automation_setup | Step-by-Step Setup]]

To receive [[recurring_bill_payment_reminders | recurring debt payment reminders]] on WhatsApp, you must first create a template for each loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### 1. Creating a New Loan Template
*   Access the system and click on the "new template" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Input the loan details, such as the loan type (e.g., "car loan") and the repayment amount (e.g., "$3,000") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### 2. Setting Up Repetition
*   For each new template, there is an option to "repeat this template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Repetition automatically populates the template values for a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Set the repetition frequency, for example, "every month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   Choose a specific day of the month for the template to repeat and add itself to the database (e.g., 16th of every month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. You can also specify a time and timezone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Save this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### 3. Adjusting Notification Timing
*   You can set the notification to be sent a specific number of days before the actual due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   For example, if you want a notification 7 days before the loan's due date, input "7" in the "days" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The system will then send the reminder 7 days prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   If you wish the notification to be sent on the same day as the due date, set this value to "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Automation and Customization
Once a [[recurring_bill_payment_reminders | recurring template]] is set, it will automatically trigger an automation that sends the debt payment notification message to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Example of Automation
The system can automatically add new loan entries based on the set repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Once a new loan entry is populated, a payment alert is triggered and sent to WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This process can be automated for any number of loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Custom Messages
You can [[customizing_payment_reminder_messages | create custom messages]] for your reminders based on your specific needs, as the system is fully customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Managing Templates
Once a loan has been repaid, you can easily delete its template to prevent further [[recurring_bill_payment_reminders | recurring notifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

This system provides a simple automation technique to manage [[automating_loan_payment_notifications | loan payment notifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. For detailed instructions on the full automation setup, refer to the information provided upon downloading the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

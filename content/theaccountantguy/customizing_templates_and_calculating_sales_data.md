This article explores how to utilize a sales receipts tracker template to manage sales data and how to generate sales receipt PDF documents using an online tool.

## Sales Receipts Tracker Template

The sales receipts tracker is a Notion template designed to help users keep track of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It features a sales receipts database that contains essential information for tracking sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Database Structure
The sales receipts database includes the following columns:
*   **Receipt Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Receipt Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Payment Method**: This column allows selection from several payment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Business Name** and **Address**: Users can enter their business details here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Customer Details**: A relational property linked to another database containing client information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Description**: Details of items sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Quantity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   **Unit Price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
    *   Multiple descriptions, quantities, and unit prices can be added per row for a single sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Subtotal**: This column sums up the total amount for individual items sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   **Total Amount**: Automatically computed based on subtotal and tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Notes**: For any related payment notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The Notion template provides a database for [[creating_and_managing_databases_for_sales_receipts | sales receipts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Sales Receipt Summary
At the top of the template, a sales receipt summary displays key figures:
*   **Total Sales**: Drawn from the sales values in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Units Sold**: Reflects the quantity of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. If additional columns for descriptions and quantities are added, the underlying formulas for the subtotal and total amount need to be updated accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Average Sales Value**: Calculated by dividing total sales by units sold, providing key performance indicator (KPI) information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This contributes to [[calculating_total_sales_revenue_using_a_tool | calculating total sales revenue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Client Summary
A client summary section displays sales information per client, contributing to [[tracking_sales_performance_by_salesperson | tracking sales performance]] by client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>:
*   Total sales for each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Total quantity of sales made to each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Average sales price for every client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The summary section is a key component of a [[creating_a_notion_bills_tracker | Notion bills tracker]], designed to provide an immediate overview of financial obligations and payment statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It is part of the [[primary_dashboard_of_notion_bills_tracker | primary dashboard of the Notion bills tracker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

This section is divided into three distinct subsections:
1.  Upcoming Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
2.  Past Due Bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
3.  Bills Paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

Each subsection displays various details related to the bills and their payment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Components of the Summary Section

### Upcoming Bills

This subsection shows bills that are yet to be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. It includes:

*   The due date of the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
*   The number of days left until the due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   The status of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>

### Past Due Bills

This part of the summary highlights bills that have exceeded their due date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. It provides:
*   The amount of the expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>
*   The original due date of the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

### Bills Paid

This subsection displays all bills that have been successfully paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Details shown are:
*   The amount paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   The due date of the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>

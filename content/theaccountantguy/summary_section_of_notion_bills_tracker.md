The summary section is a key component of a [[creating_a_bills_tracker_in_notion | Notion bills tracker]], designed to provide a quick overview of financial obligations and their statuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It is typically found within the [[primary_dashboard_features_of_notion_bills_tracker | primary dashboard]] of the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

This section presents all bills and their relevant details, including the amount due, the due date, the number of days remaining until payment, and the payment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Subsections

The summary section is divided into three main subsections:

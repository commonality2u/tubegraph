The Notion Investment Portfolio tracker, developed by Sad Biswal (the accountant guy), allows users to track all their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This tracker features a portfolio section, quick action buttons, and detailed transaction records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Initial Investment Setup

Upon starting with the tracker, users interact with an "investment section" which is categorized into "stocks" and "cryptos," with the option to add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For each investment added, users must specify the opening balance and opening units held at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Reflecting in the Portfolio Section
After the initial data is entered, the portfolio section displays the same investments, classified under their respective categories (stocks, cryptos, or any custom groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This section reflects the investment value and available units after all transactions are carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It also indicates the investment percentage, showing each investment's proportion of the total portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. A dedicated profit/loss section displays the total profit or loss for each investment post-transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Adding New Investments

The tracker includes a "quick action button" labeled "add investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Clicking this button quickly adds a new investment entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

To add details for a new investment:
1.  Click the pencil icon next to the new entry to open a panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
2.  Type in the investment name (e.g., "X investment") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  Specify the opening balance (e.g., $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
4.  Enter the opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Initially, a newly added investment may appear under "no classification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. To classify it under categories like stocks or crypto, click the three-dot icon and move it to the desired category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### [[creating_investment_categories_in_notion | Creating Investment Categories]]
Users can [[creating_investment_categories_in_notion | create their own investment categories]] by clicking the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This prompts the user to create a new group, such as "bonds," which will then add a new section for that category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Editing Existing Investments

To edit an already added investment:
1.  Click on the specific investment item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
2.  Type in the desired changes (e.g., to its name) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
3.  Click "done" to modify the entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Investments can also be deleted if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Managing Transactions

Below the investment portfolio, there is a transaction section that records all carried out transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It offers four views: "all," "buy," "sell," and "profit and loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

For every transaction, users need to input:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>
*   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   Type of transaction (e.g., buy or sell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   The investment account involved (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   Number of units (e.g., 30 units sold, 50 units bought) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   Price (calculated in buy/sell sections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>
*   Amount (units multiplied by price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>

Quick action buttons are available for transactions:
*   **Buy Investment:** Automatically adds a new page under the "buy" view, picking the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Sell Investment:** Creates a line under the "sell" view, allowing users to input relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

The "profit and loss" view for transactions shows the profit or loss generated from each transaction, taking into account both buy and sell prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For example, selling 30 units of Apple stock at $40 each, which were bought for $10 each, generates a profit of $900 ($30 difference per unit multiplied by 30 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

This [[using_notion_for_investment_tracking | Notion Investment Portfolio tracker]] simplifies the process of tracking investments with its organized structure and quick action features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

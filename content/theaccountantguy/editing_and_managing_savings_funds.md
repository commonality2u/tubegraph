The savings funds dashboard provides two primary views: the "Savings Target" for setting individual fund goals, and the "Savings Overview" for tracking overall progress against those targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Setting and Editing Savings Targets

You can manage individual savings funds and their corresponding goal amounts within the "Savings Target" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Default savings are included with preset goal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Editing Existing Savings Funds

To modify an existing savings fund:
*   Click the "pencil button" next to the fund name to rename it (e.g., "car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   Clicking the pencil button again allows you to set or change the goal amount (e.g., from $2,500 to $3,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Alternatively, you can click on the fund's details directly to open options for editing both the name and goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   Any changes made to the savings fund, such as renaming or adjusting the goal amount, will automatically update in the "Savings Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Adding New Savings Funds

To add a new savings fund:
1.  Click the "add savings button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This will automatically create a new entry below the existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  Click the "pencil icon" to give the new fund a name (e.g., "new saving fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
3.  Set the goal amount; a default of $1,000 is provided, which can be changed to any desired amount (e.g., $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Deleting Savings Funds

To remove a savings fund:
*   Click the "six dots" located on the left side of the specific saving fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Select the "delete option" from the menu that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The fund will be automatically deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Tracking Savings Progress

The "Savings Overview" section displays the total savings accumulated, the overall targeted savings amount, and the percentage of the targeted amount achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This provides a clear overview of how your [[calculating_and_tracking_savings_goals | savings goals]] are progressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Adding Transactions to Savings Funds

To contribute to a specific savings fund:
1.  Navigate to the "transactions panel" at the bottom of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
2.  Click "add transaction" to create a new entry with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Transactions are automatically grouped by month, with the most recent months appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
3.  You can adjust the transaction date using the calendar window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
4.  Enter details for the transaction (e.g., "saving for car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  In the "saving fund" column, select the specific fund you are contributing to (e.g., "car fund") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
6.  Input the saving amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The total savings for that fund, as well as the overall "Savings Overview," will automatically update to reflect the new contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Customization Options

### Currency Settings
The savings tracker supports various currencies. To change the currency:
*   Click on any amount field that displays the dollar currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Click "edit property" to find the "number format" setting, which lists all supported currencies in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Grouping Transactions
The transaction view is dynamically customizable by grouping transactions by different time periods:
*   Click the "three dots" icon in the transaction panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Under the "grouping" option, you can choose to group transactions by month (default), week, or year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This will dynamically alter how your savings history is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   The entire view is customizable to fit individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

The Sinking Fund Analysis tab in the Google Sheet personal finance tracker allows users to manage and track their [[sinking_funds | sinking funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This section provides an overview of total contributions made and how much contribution is remaining for each [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

It operates similarly to the monthly budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Setup and Data Entry

To utilize the [[sinking_funds | sinking funds]] analysis, users need to input specific details:
*   **Specify Sinking Funds**: List all the [[sinking_funds | sinking funds]] you intend to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount**: Set a target goal amount for each [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Monthly Contribution**: Define the monthly amount you plan to contribute to each [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Starting Amount**: Add any initial [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] amount already saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   *Example*: For a home renovation [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]], you might set a $5,000 goal, a $400 monthly contribution, and note an existing $2,800 fund to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Analysis and Tracking

Once the initial setup is complete and contributions are entered, the tracker automatically calculates and displays key metrics:
*   **Amount Saved So Far**: This figure is updated based on the entries made by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Amount Left**: Shows how much more needs to be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Total Progress**: Represents the total savings divided by the set goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Expected Completion Date**: Estimates when the [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] will be completed if monthly contributions continue at the specified rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This includes the estimated date and the number of months remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Transaction Entry

On the right side of the tab, users can log transactions for their [[sinking_funds | sinking funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>:
*   Enter the date of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   Select the appropriate [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   Input the amount contributed for that specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Dynamic Overviews

The tab provides dynamic graphical overviews:
*   **Total Saving Fund Goal**: Displays the aggregate goal amount for all [[sinking_funds | sinking funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Total Savings Made So Far**: Shows the combined total of all contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Savings Still Left**: Indicates the remaining amount across all [[sinking_funds | sinking funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Graphical Representation**: A graph visualizes the progress, with a green bar indicating total savings made and a black bar showing how much more savings are needed for each specific [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This allows for a quick understanding of savings progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

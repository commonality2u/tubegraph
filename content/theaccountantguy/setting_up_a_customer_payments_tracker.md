The customer payments tracker is a simple template designed to [[tracking_customer_and_payment_information | track all customer payments]] in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Template Sections

The tracker is divided into several key sections:

*   **Summary Section** Located on the left side of the tracker, this section displays a quick overview of financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It includes:
    *   Total payment due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
    *   Payment amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
    *   The difference between due and received amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
    *   Percentage of total payments received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Main Sections (Right Side)** On the right, there are three primary sections for managing customer and payment data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>:
    *   [[features_of_the_customer_payments_tracker_template | Customer Section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
    *   [[features_of_the_customer_payments_tracker_template | Overview Section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
    *   [[features_of_the_customer_payments_tracker_template | Transaction Section]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

### Setting up the Customer Section

The [[features_of_the_customer_payments_tracker_template | customer section]] allows you to set up your entire [[tracking_customer_and_payment_information | customer database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Customer Sub-sections:** This section is divided into three default sub-sections: "Regular," "Seasonal," and "Occasional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   **Editing Sub-sections:** To edit any sub-section, simply click on it and begin editing the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   **Adding Sub-sections:** Click the plus icon within the section to add new sub-sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Managing Customers:** Under each sub-section, individual customers are listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   **Updating Payment Due:** For each customer, the total payment amount due is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This amount can be changed by clicking on it and entering a new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   **Editing Customer Names:** Customer names can be edited by clicking the pencil icon next to the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   **Adding New Customers:** To add a new customer, click the plus icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Deleting Customers:** Customers can be deleted by clicking the three-dot menu next to their entry and selecting "delete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Utilizing the Overview Section

Once the [[tracking_customer_and_payment_information | customer database]] and due payment amounts are set up, the [[features_of_the_customer_payments_tracker_template | overview section]] provides a summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It shows the total payment received, the total payment amount due, and the percentage of payment received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This data is populated from the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Recording Transactions

The [[features_of_the_customer_payments_tracker_template | transaction section]] is where you record individual payments and [[tracking_payments_and_transactions | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For each transaction, you can enter:

*   The date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   The customer name (selected from a list of all customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   The payment amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   A document section to attach specific invoices related to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

As these details are filled, the payment received amount in the overview and summary sections automatically updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Customization

The customer payments tracker template is entirely [[customizing_the_payments_tracker_template | customizable]] to fit specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

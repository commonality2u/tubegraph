This article explains how to utilize a dedicated [[Notion]] template for [[finance_management_using_notion | business planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template offers two primary views: the Business Plan Roadmap and the Events Timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Business Plan Roadmap

The Business Plan Roadmap organizes the entire [[finance_management_using_notion | business planning]] process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Stages of Planning
The template includes 11 predefined stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, each with a defined name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Examples include:
*   Conceptual Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning and Structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Profitability and Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

You can [[customizing_notion_templates_for_business_needs | edit]] these stages using the pencil icon to suit specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Defining Objectives and Tracking Progress
For each stage, you can:
*   Define specific objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Specify the corresponding business plan stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   Track completion percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Managing Tasks within Stages
Clicking on a stage reveals a detailed view displaying associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, such as those for "Conception and Research" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Each task includes:
*   A deadline for completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   A checkbox to mark the task as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   An option to assign a status (e.g., "Not Started," "In Progress," "Completed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

New tasks can be added by clicking the "new" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Below the tasks, a documentation section allows for detailed descriptions of objectives and tasks for that specific stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Automatic Completion Updates
The template automatically updates the completion percentage for a stage when tasks are marked as complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion status will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Events Timeline

The Events Timeline view presents all planned activities in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

This view displays:
*   Specific deadline dates for each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   The stage name and associated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The date and status of each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

It provides a quick overview of all planned items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Arrows on the timeline allow navigation to specific dates and stages to view their details and properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

This template is a useful tool for [[using_notion_for_business_tracking | tracking]] and [[how_to_set_financial_goals_in_notion | planning]] your [[finance_management_using_notion | business goals]] effectively in [[Notion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

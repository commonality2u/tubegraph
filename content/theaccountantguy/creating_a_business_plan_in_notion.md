This article explains how to utilize a dedicated business plan template in Notion to streamline the planning process for your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The template is designed to help organize and track various aspects of your business development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Template Views

The business plan template offers two primary views to manage your planning:
*   **Business Plan Roadmap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   **Events Timeline** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

### Business Plan Roadmap

This view divides the entire business planning process into distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The template comes with 11 predefined stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, including:
*   Conceptual Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Planning and Structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Profitability and Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

You can customize or edit these stages using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

For each business plan, you can:
*   **Define Objectives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   **Specify the corresponding stage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
*   Track the **Completion Percentage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

#### Managing Stages and Tasks

By clicking on each stage, you can access a detailed view that displays:
*   **Associated Tasks**: Tasks related to that specific business planning stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For instance, "Conceptual Research" might have two tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Deadline**: The date by which each task should be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Completion Checkbox**: A checkbox to mark tasks as completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Status**: Allows you to assign a status to each task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

You can add new tasks for a specific stage by clicking the "new" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. At the bottom of each stage's detailed view, there is a **Documentation** section where you can specify objectives and tasks in more detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

#### Tracking Progress

Marking tasks as complete automatically updates the completion percentage for that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For example, if a stage has two tasks and one is completed, the completion percentage will show 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Completing both tasks will update it to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This completion percentage is reflected at the top level of the roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Events Timeline

The "Events Timeline" view presents all the planned stages and tasks in a calendar and timeline format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   It displays the **specific deadline dates** for stages, such as December 3 to December 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   For each stage, you can see the **stage name**, associated **tasks**, **dates**, and **status** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Arrows on the timeline indicate the dates for different stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Clicking on these arrows will take you to the specific date and show detailed information about all associated stages and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This view provides a quick overview of your planned activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

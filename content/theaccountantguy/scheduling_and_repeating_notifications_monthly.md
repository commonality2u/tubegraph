This article demonstrates how to [[receiving_timely_payment_reminders_through_whatsapp | receive subscription payment reminders directly on WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This process leverages a database to set up and manage these recurring alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Setting Up a New Reminder Template

To begin, you will create a new template within the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This involves:
*   Clicking a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   Selecting the option to set up a subscription reminder alert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Typing the name of the subscription, e.g., "Spotify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Specifying the subscription amount, e.g., $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Once these details are entered, a new tab for the subscription will be added to your database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This forms part of the process for [[setting_up_subscription_reminders_using_a_database | setting up subscription reminders using a database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Configuring Monthly Repetition

The next step is to configure the reminder to repeat monthly, which is a key aspect of [[scheduling_recurring_bill_payment_notifications | scheduling recurring bill payment notifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
1.  Click the three dots associated with the newly created entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  Select the "repeat" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
3.  Choose "every month" as the repetition mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This action ensures that the reminder for the specified subscription and amount will be repeated each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
4.  A new window will appear, allowing you to specify the exact time and start date for the repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For instance, you can set it to repeat every month on the 23rd at 11:56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
5.  After clicking "Save," a repetition arrow will appear next to the entry, indicating that the Spotify subscription reminder alert will automatically repeat every month on the 23rd at 11:56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Receiving WhatsApp Notifications

Once the reminder is set, the system will automatically add a new line item in the database at the specified time and date each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Subsequently, you will automatically receive the notification alert on WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

For example, a notification for a Spotify payment reminder of $150 will be sent directly to your WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This notification will be received every month on the 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> and includes a "pay now" link to facilitate direct payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This demonstrates how to [[automating_subscription_payment_reminders_on_whatsapp | automate subscription payment reminders on WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Customization and Setup

The reminder alerts received on WhatsApp are fully customizable to meet individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. There is no fixed template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Upon downloading the template, users will receive all necessary instructions and a guide to automate this process entirely on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

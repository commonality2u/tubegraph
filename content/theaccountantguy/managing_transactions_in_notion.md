This guide explains how to [[managing_finances_with_notion | manage transactions]] within a Notion template designed for tracking tax payments, focusing on revenue and expense entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The template helps users track all tax liabilities at a glance, offering a quarterly tax payment section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

At the top of the template, a tax payment summary provides key information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Accounts

This section is where you set up your [[entering_transactions_and_managing_accounts_in_notion | revenue sources]] and [[entering_transactions_and_managing_accounts_in_notion | expense sources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   [[sales_transactions_and_customization_in_notion | Revenue sources]] are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   Expense sources allow for availing input tax credit to offset tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The template typically includes example sources like "services" and "goods" for revenue, and "purchases" for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Quick action buttons, such as "Add Revenue Source" and "Add Expense Source," automatically create new account entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Users can then use a pencil icon to fill in specific details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As accounts are added, the summary numbers update automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Financials

This section helps you [[managing_finances_using_notion | track]] your total revenue and expense amounts, along with the corresponding tax liability and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For instance, if $2,000 in revenue is earned from services with a 10% tax rate, it will show a $200 tax payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Similarly, purchases will reflect input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. All information in this section automatically updates based on the transactions entered at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes

This view reflects all tax payments due for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For each quarter, it displays taxes payable, input tax, and the final tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Transaction Section

After setting up revenue and expense accounts, you can scroll down to the transaction section to [[bookkeeping_in_notion | record]] your daily activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. [[entering_transactions_and_managing_accounts_in_notion | Transactions]] are categorized into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Adding Revenue Transactions

To add a revenue transaction:
1.  Click the "Add Revenue" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This will automatically add a new line item with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
2.  Select the relevant period (e.g., Quarter 3 for September) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Choose the appropriate revenue account (e.g., Goods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
4.  Enter the transaction amount (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  Specify the tax rate (e.g., 8%), which will automatically calculate the tax payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Once entered, these details instantly update the quarterly taxes and other summary sections at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions

Adding an expense transaction follows a similar process:
1.  Click "Add Expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. A new line item will appear with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  Fill in the period (e.g., Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
3.  Select the expense account (e.g., Purchases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
4.  Input the amount (e.g., $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Set the tax rate (e.g., 10%), which calculates the input credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

These entries also update the overall tax liability and input credit figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Profit/Loss Section

The template also includes a profit/loss section, providing a quick overview of total revenue earned from all [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | transactions]], total expenses booked, and the resulting profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This allows for comprehensive [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | tracking of finances]] within Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

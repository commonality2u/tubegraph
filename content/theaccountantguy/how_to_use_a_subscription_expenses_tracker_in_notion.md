From: [[theaccountantguy]] <br/> 

This article demonstrates how to utilize a dedicated Notion template for [[handling_subscriptions_and_recurring_payments_in_notion | tracking all your subscription expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tracker functions as a specialized [[expense_tracking_in_notion | expense tracker]] within Notion, focusing specifically on recurring payments. It can be integrated into broader [[tracking_income_and_expenses_in_notion | personal finance tracking]] or [[business_expense_tracking_with_notion | business expense tracking]] systems.

## Subscription Overview Section

The "Subscription Overview" provides a quick glance at all your subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Categories View
Under the categories view, subscriptions are divided into "Active" and "Cancel" subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. For each subscription listed, you will find:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   The total expenses incurred for that subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   The billing period for the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

You can adjust the billing period by clicking on it and selecting from available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While you can change the name of the billing period options, it's recommended not to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Expenses Section

The "Expenses" section categorizes subscriptions into different groups, such as "Infotainment," "Education," and "Music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Managing Groups
*   **Add New Group:** Click the plus (+) icon to add a new group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Edit Existing Group:** Click on an existing group to change its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Under each subscription classification, you'll see:
*   The name of the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   The total expenses incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   The percentage of that subscription towards the total subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Quick Actions
A "quick action button" to "Add Subscription" is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Clicking this button automatically adds a new subscription under a "note" subscription category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. You can then click the three dots to move it to any classification of your choice, such as "Active" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The pencil icon allows you to edit the details of the newly added subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Transaction Section

This section is where you record all the details to book your subscription expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Views
*   **Active Subscriptions View:** Shows all currently active subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Cancel Subscription View:** Displays subscriptions that have been canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Subscriptions are bifurcated by month, with the most recent month appearing at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The total sum of expenses for each particular month is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

This applies to various frequencies like annual or weekly subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Canceling a Subscription

### Quick Transaction Addition
A "space subscription" button allows for quickly adding a new transaction entry, where you can then input all required details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

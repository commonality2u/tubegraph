An Investment Portfolio tracker allows users to [[monitoring_investments_and_net_worth | track all investments]] and understand their performance, including [[understanding_profit_and_loss_in_tax_tracking | calculating profit and loss]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>

## Initial Setup: Investments Section

The tracker's "Investment" section is categorized into types such as stocks, cryptos, and user-defined categories like bonds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a> Users can add new categories by clicking the plus icon and creating a new group (e.g., "bonds"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:04">[02:30:04]</a>

For each investment added, users must input:
*   **Opening Balance:** The initial monetary value of the investment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>
*   **Opening Units:** The initial number of units held. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>
These details should represent the start of the financial year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>

## Portfolio Section: Overview and Profit/Loss Indication

The "Portfolio" section reflects the investment value and available units after all transactions have been carried out. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a> Investments are classified under their respective categories (e.g., stocks, cryptos). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>

Key indicators in this section include:
*   **Investment Percentage:** Shows the proportion of a specific investment relative to the total investment portfolio. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>
*   **Profit/Loss Section:** Displays the total [[calculating_profit_and_loss_for_inventory_sales | profit and loss]] for each investment after all transactions are completed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a> A profit/loss figure for every investment appears on the right side, indicating performance as transactions occur. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>
*   **Total Summation of Profit/Loss:** A combined profit or loss figure is available at the top for each section (e.g., total for all stocks). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>

## Transaction Tracking and Profit/Loss Calculation

The "Transaction" section provides a detailed record of all investment activities, categorized into "All," "Buy," and "Sell" views. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:08">[03:03:08]</a>

Each transaction requires the following details:
*   Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:06">[03:20:06]</a>
*   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:05">[03:21:05]</a>
*   Type of transaction (Buy/Sell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:05">[03:23:05]</a>
*   Investment Account (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:05">[03:25:05]</a>
*   Number of Units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>
*   Price (calculated automatically for buy/sell sections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:08">[03:47:08]</a>
*   Amount (Units multiplied by Price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:07">[03:53:07]</a>

### Profit and Loss Section

The dedicated "Profit and Loss" view within the transaction section highlights the profit or loss generated from each individual transaction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:04">[04:22:04]</a>

Here, an "additional information of Buy price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:06">[04:39:06]</a> is shown alongside the sales data. The profit or loss is calculated based on the difference between the selling price and the buying price per unit, multiplied by the number of units sold. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:03">[04:41:03]</a>

*   **Example Calculation:** If 30 units of Apple stock were sold for $40 each, and they were originally bought for $10 each, the calculation is: `($40 Sell Price - $10 Buy Price) * 30 Units = $900 Profit`. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>

### Quick Actions for Transactions

The tracker includes quick action buttons to streamline transaction entry:
*   **"Add Investment" Button:** Adds a new investment entry to the investment section. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>
*   **"Buy Investment" Button:** Automatically adds a new line item under the "Buy" view, pre-populating the current date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:04">[04:58:04]</a>
*   **"Sell Investment" Button:** Creates a new line item under the "Sell" view, allowing users to input relevant information for a sale. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:06">[05:20:06]</a>

By utilizing these features, users can effectively [[tracking_transactions_and_balances_for_investments | track transactions and balances for investments]], [[managing_investment_categories_and_classifications | manage investment categories and classifications]], and [[tracking_income_and_expenses | track income and expenses]], ultimately understanding their investment portfolio's performance.

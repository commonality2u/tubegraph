This article outlines the process of [[generating_boarding_pass_pdfs_using_notion | generating]], previewing, and [[exporting_and_downloading_pdf_documents | downloading PDF documents]] for boarding passes using Notion.

## Generating Boarding Pass Documents

The process begins with a [[using_a_boarding_pass_database_in_notion | boarding pass database]] containing all necessary details for each boarding pass, alongside a boarding pass template used for PDF generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

To initiate the [[generating_sales_receipts_pdf_documents | PDF document generation]]:
1.  Specify "boarding pass" in the connection details as the PDF output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Connect the [[using_a_boarding_pass_database_in_notion | boarding pass database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
3.  Select the "boarding pass template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

After these steps, the system loads all information from the database and template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Once loaded, click "export" to begin [[generating_sales_receipts_pdf_documents | generating the PDF documents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Previewing Generated Documents

Upon successful export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, you can click "preview sample" to view the generated boarding pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The preview will show the boarding pass populated with all the details from the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Downloading PDF Files

After previewing, the files can be [[exporting_and_downloading_pdf_documents | downloaded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Once the files are [[exporting_and_downloading_pdf_documents | downloaded]], they can be opened. The process involves extracting the files and then opening them to verify the generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Multiple PDF outputs will show different names and contexts, corresponding to the different entries in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This method allows for efficient [[bulk_pdf_document_generation | generation of PDF documents]] using Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

This article explores tools and processes for managing sales receipts and [[generating_pdf_documents_for_business_purposes | generating PDF documents for business purposes]]. It covers the use of a sales receipts tracker template and the PDF Output tool for individual and [[bulk_export_of_pdf_documents | bulk export of PDF documents]].

## Sales Receipts Tracker Template

A sales receipts tracker template is designed to help businesses keep track of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Database Structure
The core of the template is a sales receipts database that stores crucial information for tracking sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   **Receipt Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Receipt Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Payment Method** (multiple options available) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   **Business Name and Address** (customizable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Customer Details** (a relational property linked to a separate client database) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   **Description of Items Sold** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Quantity of Sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   **Unit Price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

Multiple descriptions, quantities, and unit prices can be added for a single sale within a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Each row can represent different items sold in varying quantities and unit prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Financial Calculations and Summaries
The template automatically computes financial data:
*   **Subtotal Column:** Sums the total amount of individual items sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Rate:** Applied to the subtotal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Total Amount:** Calculated automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Notes Column:** For related payment notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Additional columns, linked to other databases, provide further integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The template provides a summary of sales performance:
*   **Sales Receipt Summary:** Shows the total sales made and the total units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   *Note:* If additional columns for descriptions or quantities are added, formulas for subtotal and total amount need to be updated manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Average Sales Value:** Calculated as total sales divided by units sold, providing key business information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Client Summary:** Displays total sales, total quantity of sales, and average sales price for each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This section can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

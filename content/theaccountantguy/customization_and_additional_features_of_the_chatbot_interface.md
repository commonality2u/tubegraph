The [[introduction_to_notion_formula_chatbot | Notion Formula Chatbot]] is designed to assist Notion users in deriving formulas for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. To ensure seamless interaction and optimize its functionality, the chatbot offers several customization options and additional features.

### Navigating the Chatbot Interface
The chatbot interface is divided into three main sections:
*   **Info Section** This section provides details related to the chatbot, including an embedded video explanation and contact information for feedback or issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Chat Section** This is where users interact with the bot by typing messages and receiving formula responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Give Section** This section allows users to donate to support the product's development and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

If the left panel (where API keys and GPT models are configured) is not visible, it can be opened by clicking the arrow on the left side of the chat window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This is particularly useful for users on smartphones or other devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### [[generating_and_entering_api_keys_for_chatbot_use | API Key and GPT Model Configuration]]
Before interacting with the chatbot, users must input their OpenAI API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
To [[generating_and_entering_api_keys_for_chatbot_use | generate an API key]]:
1.  Click the question mark icon in the chatbot interface to get the link to the OpenAI platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
2.  On the OpenAI platform, navigate to "API Keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
3.  Click "Create new secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
4.  Provide a name for the key (e.g., "test key") and click "Create secret key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
5.  **Crucially, copy the generated key immediately**, as it will not be visible again once the window is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
6.  Paste the copied key into the designated field in the chatbot interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. A confirmation message will appear once the API key is successfully entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

New OpenAI accounts typically receive a $5 free credit, which can be used to test the chatbot, but this credit is limited to the [[using_gpt_models_with_notion_chatbot | GPT 3.5 Turbo]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### [[using_gpt_models_with_notion_chatbot | Selecting GPT Models]]
After entering the API key, users can select their preferred [[using_gpt_models_with_notion_chatbot | GPT model]] from a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The available models are:
*   **GPT 3.5 Turbo**: An older model that is less accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. It is suitable for users on a free plan with the initial $5 credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The demonstrated interactions in the video were performed using GPT 3.5 Turbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **GPT 4 (0125 Preview)**: Offers better and more accurate results, recommended for users with a paid OpenAI plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Personalizing the User Experience
The chatbot interface allows for several aesthetic customizations:

#### Customizing User Icon
Users can upload an image to replace the default user icon in the chat interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This is an optional feature for personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The icon updates immediately upon image selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Clicking the 'X' reverts to the original icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

2.  Select "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
3.  Under "App theme colors and font," use the dropdown to choose between:
    *   **Light**: Changes the background to a light color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   **Dark**: Reverts to the dark theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   **System Settings**: Allows editing the active theme and changing colors and font family to suit user requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Managing Conversations

This article outlines the process for [[bulk_export_of_pdf_documents | bulk exporting PDF documents]] using PDF output.com, leveraging Notion templates and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The method described focuses on generating multiple PDF documents from a single template populated with data from a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Prerequisites

To begin the [[bulk_export_of_pdf_documents | bulk PDF document export process]], you will need:
*   A Notion template with elements enclosed in curly braces, such as `{{receipt number}}` or `{{customer name}}` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These elements act as placeholders for data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   A Notion database where each column name exactly matches the elements in the template (including spacing and capitalization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Each row in this database will correspond to a unique PDF document to be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   An account with PDF output.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Export Process Steps

The [[bulk_export_of_pdf_documents | bulk PDF document generation]] process via PDF output.com involves several key steps:

### 1. Accessing PDF Output Tool
Navigate to PDF output.com, which is the tool used for generating PDF documents in bulk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Log in to your account to access the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### 2. Duplicating Notion Template and Database
Before connecting to PDF Output, you must first duplicate the desired Notion template and its corresponding database into your local Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   Go to the "Templates" section within PDF output.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Search for the specific template you wish to use (e.g., "payment receipts") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Each template provides a database link and a template link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Click on both links to open them in new windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   Duplicate both the template and the database into your Notion workspace by clicking "Duplicate" and selecting your desired workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### 3. Connecting Notion to PDF Output
Once the template and database are duplicated to your Notion workspace:
*   In PDF output.com, click "Click here to add database" or "Add template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Grant permission to PDF output.com to access your Notion pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   Select your Notion workspace (e.g., "accountant guy workspace") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Choose the specific template and database you duplicated earlier and click "Allow access" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   The system will authenticate and connect the chosen database and template to your PDF output account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### 4. Mapping Database Properties to Template Elements
After successful connection:
*   Give your connection a name (e.g., "payment receipts") and click "Next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   The system will automatically populate the database properties and the corresponding template elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   If you have followed the naming convention precisely (curly braces in template, exact column names in database), the mapping will be automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   If there are any mismatches, you can manually map properties by clicking on the unmapped element and searching for the correct corresponding database column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### 5. Generating and Downloading PDFs
Once all properties are correctly mapped:
*   Click on "Create PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   The tool will process the database rows and template, generating a PDF document for each row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   After the export is successful, you can "Preview a sample" of the generated PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   Finally, click "Download all documents" to download a zip file containing all the generated PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

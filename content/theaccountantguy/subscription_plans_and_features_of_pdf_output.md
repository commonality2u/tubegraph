When utilizing PDF Output, the choice of subscription plan affects certain features of the generated documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Plan Features: Watermark

If you are on the free plan, the generated PDF documents will include a watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. To avoid having this watermark element on your documents, you need to be on a paid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This is a key distinction regarding [[pdf_output_software_features_and_upgrades | PDF output software features and upgrades]] between the free and paid tiers.

## Upgrading Your Subscription

To remove the watermark and access paid features, you can upgrade your subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This process involves navigating to the "upgrade" section within the PDF Output interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. From there, you can select and upgrade to a particular plan that best suits your requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This action falls under [[managing_pdfoutput_settings_and_subscriptions | managing PDFOutput settings and subscriptions]].

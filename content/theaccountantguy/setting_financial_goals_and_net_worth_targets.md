This article outlines how to set and track personal financial goals, including net worth, budgets, and savings, using a Notion-based system.

## Overview of the Personal Finance Tracker
The Notion-based personal finance tracker is designed to help users monitor their finances efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is structured into three main sections:
1.  **Net Worth Target**: Allows users to specify their [[Setting net worth goals and tracking progress | net worth target]] for the entire financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  **Account Section**: Where users define different accounts under income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, including opening balances, payment frequency, and category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section**: Provides a comprehensive overview of all finances at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Additional dedicated sections within the tracker include:
*   **Debt**: Shows upcoming and past debt payments, total debt, and debt paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Budget**: Allows setting budgets for estimated income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Savings**: For tracking personal finances and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Bills**: Displays upcoming and past bill payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Subscription**: Manages subscriptions with status (active) and payment dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Net Worth**: Provides an overview of the total net worth achieved and the amount remaining to reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Transaction Section**: Where all income, expense, asset, or liability transactions are recorded, impacting all other sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## [[Setting net worth goals and tracking progress | Setting Net Worth Targets]]

The [[Setting net worth goals and tracking progress | net worth goal]] section allows users to define their target net worth for the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. This target can be easily adjusted, for example, from $7,000 to $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

### [[Utilizing Notion to monitor net worth and financial goals | Tracking Net Worth Progress]]
The net worth section in the summary view provides a comprehensive look at your financial standing relative to your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. It displays:
*   The set [[Setting net worth goals and tracking progress | net worth goal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   Your current total net worth, calculated as assets minus liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
*   The difference between your goal and current net worth, indicating how much you are "lagging behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   The percentage of the [[Setting net worth goals and tracking progress | net worth goal]] achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   Total growth, which is the closing net worth less the opening net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. Opening net worth is derived from the initial balances of assets and liabilities set in the account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. Any changes to opening balances or transactions will automatically update these figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

## [[How to set financial goals in Notion | Setting Budget and Goal Amounts for Different Components]]

### [[Setting Budget and Goal Amounts for Different Components | Setting Budget Goals]]
To set a budget, first input all income and expense transactions. Then, navigate to the "Budget" view under the summary section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This view displays all incurred expenses and income against their budgeted amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. You can adjust any budget amount by simply clicking on the relevant field and entering a new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. The system automatically updates the percentage of expenses incurred relative to the total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

### [[Setting savings targets and goals in Notion | Setting Savings Targets]]
Savings goals are set by creating new asset accounts (e.g., "Car Fund") and classifying them under the "Savings" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. For each savings fund, a "goal amount" can be specified, which then reflects the total amount saved so far and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

#### [[Tracking savings goals and progress | Tracking Savings Progress]]
To track savings progress, transactions related to these funds are entered in the asset section of the transactions view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Savings contributions are recorded as outflow transactions from your bank account to the savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. This updates the total savings amount and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

## Managing Debt, Bills, and Subscriptions

### Debt Payments
Debt accounts are set up under the "Liabilities" section in the accounts view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Each debt can have an opening balance and is classified as "Debt" with a specified payment frequency (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Transactions for debt payments are recorded in the "Liability" section of the transactions view as "outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Taking a new loan would be an "inflow" transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. The "Debt" view in the summary section tracks upcoming and past payments, total loan amount, and repayment percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Bills
Bills are set up as expenses in the account section, classified as "Bills" with a defined payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

Bill payments are recorded as "outflow" transactions in the "Expense" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The "Bills" section under the summary view shows upcoming and past payments, similar to the debt tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

### [[Tracking subscriptions and net worth | Subscriptions]]
Subscriptions are set up as expenses under the accounts section, classified as "Subscription" with an annual or monthly payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

Subscription payments are recorded as "outflow" transactions in the "Expense" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. The "Subscription" view in the summary section provides a similar "upcoming payments" and "past payments" overview, along with the subscription status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

## [[Financial Planning Tools | Financial Planning Tools]] for Couples and Investments

### For Couples
The tracker can be adapted for couples by splitting account categories (income, expenses, assets, liabilities) by individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. For example, "Salary by Him" and "Side Hustle by Her" can denote income for each partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

### Investments
An "Investment" tab is available to track investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. It shows the total investment amount, number of units, and profit or loss from transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.

Investment accounts are set up under the "Assets" tab in the accounts section, where they are classified as "Stocks," "Crypto," or other custom categories, and assigned to the "Investments" asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. Opening balances and units can also be specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

#### Tracking Investment Transactions
Investment transactions are recorded in the "Assets" section.
*   **Purchases**: Always record purchases at their cost price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Sales**: When selling investments, record the cost value of the units sold, not the sale price. This allows the system to compute the profit or loss accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

## Customization and Accessibility

### Viewing Specific Transactions
To quickly view transactions related to a specific account (e.g., "Salary"), you can click on the account name in the summary view and then select "View Transactions" at the bottom of the opened window. This will filter and display only transactions linked to that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.

### Device Compatibility
The Notion template is available on all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

### Cost of Use
Notion is a free tool, requiring only an email ID to sign up and use the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. No extra charges are involved beyond the template's purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

### Multiple Currencies
Notion supports various currencies. To change the currency, navigate to any property with a dollar sign (or other currency symbol), click "Edit Property," go to "Number Format," and select the desired currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>. This process needs to be repeated for all views that display monetary values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.

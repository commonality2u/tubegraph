The Accounts Receivable and Payable Tracker includes a [[quarterly_cash_flow_overview | quarterly summary]] section that provides an overview of financial activity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>. This summary is part of the overall transaction section, which also includes receivable and payable segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

### Quarterly Summary Details

The [[quarterly_cash_flow_overview | quarterly summary]] compiles data from all transactions recorded in the receivable and payable sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. For each quarter, it reflects:
*   **Total Receivable Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>
*   **Total Payable Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>
*   **Net Balance** (receivable less payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>

The total amount across all quarters is also reflected at the top of this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

#### Example: Third Quarter Summary

As an illustration, if the third quarter has a total receivable amount of $1,150 (derived from individual invoices like $150 and $1,000) and a total payable amount of $250, the net balance for that quarter would be $900 ($1,150 - $250) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

This feature provides a concise [[quarterly_cash_flow_overview | quarterly overview]] of the outstanding amounts on both the receivable and payable sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

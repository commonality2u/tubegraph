This article explains how to utilize a Notion template to track all tax payments, providing a quarterly tax payment section to view tax liabilities at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The system helps understand where tax payments stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

At the top of the template, a tax payment summary displays key financial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Accounts
The "Accounts" section is where you set up all your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources**: These are where tax liabilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples include "services" and "goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources**: These allow you to avail input tax credit to set off against tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example is "purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

You can add new revenue or expense sources using quick action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The system automatically updates the count of revenue and expense sources as you add them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Financials
The "Financials" section allows you to track revenue amounts, expense amounts, along with tax liabilities and input taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For example, "Services" revenue of $2,000 might have a total tax payable of $200 (a 10% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Input taxes from purchases, such as $10, are also displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. All details in the "Financials" section automatically update once transactions are entered at the bottom of the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes
This section reflects all tax payments you need to make for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For each quarter, it shows:
*   Taxes payable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Input tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

For instance, if all initial transactions are booked for Quarter 3, only Quarter 3 will show updated figures for taxes payable, input tax, and tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Transaction Section

After setting up your revenue and expense account sources, you can scroll down to the "Transaction" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Transactions are classified into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Adding Revenue Transactions
To add a revenue transaction:
1.  Click the "Add Revenue" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. A new line item is automatically added with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
2.  Select the **period** (e.g., Quarter 3 for September) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
3.  Select the **account** (e.g., "Goods") from your defined revenue accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
4.  Enter the **amount** (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
5.  Enter the **tax rate** (e.g., 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. The tax payable will automatically calculate (e.g., $80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

Once entered, the quarterly taxes summary at the top automatically updates to reflect the new tax payable and adjusted tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions
Adding an expense transaction follows a similar process:
1.  Click the "Add Expense" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. A new line item is added with the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
2.  Fill in details for the **period** (e.g., Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
3.  Select the **account** (e.g., "Purchases") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
4.  Enter the **amount** (e.g., $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
5.  Enter the **tax rate** (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The input credit will automatically calculate (e.g., $50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

The total input credit and overall tax liability in the summary sections will update accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## Profit & Loss Section

The template also includes a "Profit Loss" section, which displays:
*   Total revenue earned from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>
*   Total expenses booked so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>
*   The total profit made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>

Wien is a platform that facilitates the creation of AI-generated content directly within a Notion workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. When [[creating_content_on_notion_pages | creating content]], users have two primary options: a Notion page or a Notion database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## What is a Notion Database?
Unlike a simple blank Notion page, a Notion database is structured in the form of rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Wien can generate AI content for both Notion pages and Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Initially, a database will be empty, without any content written in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Generating AI Content in a Notion Database
The process of generating content within a Notion database involves several steps:

### 1. Setting Up the Connection
*   **Name the Connection:** First, provide a name for the connection, such as "notion database" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Select Database Type:** Choose "notion database" from the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Provide Notion URL:** Navigate to the desired Notion database, copy its URL, and paste it into the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### 2. Defining the Content Request
*   **Identify Topics:** If the database contains multiple topics in different rows, Wien can generate content for each one individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For example, if a database has three particular topics, the goal might be to create a blog post of 100 words for each topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Enter Prompt:** Input a prompt specifying the content to be generated, such as "write me a block of 100 words on the topic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### 3. Content Generation
Once the prompt is entered, the AI will begin generating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The database, initially blank, will start populating with the generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This content will appear in the designated sections and across different rows, as each row is captured for content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Wien allows users to leverage AI to generate content efficiently for both Notion pages and [[creating_databases_in_notion | Notion databases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

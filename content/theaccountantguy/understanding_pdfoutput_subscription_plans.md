[[introduction_to_pdfoutput_tool | PDFOutput]] offers various subscription plans to meet user needs for generating PDF documents from Notion databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These plans dictate access to features and document generation limits.

## Basic Plan
The basic plan is a free tier that does not have an expiry date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Under this plan, users are limited to generating 1,000 documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. PDFs generated on the free plan will include a watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Upgrading Subscription
To access more features and increase document limits, users can [[options_for_upgrading_pdf_output_features_and_settings | upgrade their subscription]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This option is accessible via an "upgrade option" within the [[using_pdfoutput_settings_and_subscription_options | PDFOutput]] interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Paid Plans
Upon clicking "upgrade subscription," users can view other pricing plans, including Pro and Enterprise options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. These plans can be chosen on a monthly or yearly basis, according to individual requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

Benefits of paid plans include the removal of the watermark from generated PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Activating a New Subscription
After upgrading to a new plan, users need to click "activate subscription" to apply the new subscription settings to their [[using_pdfoutput_settings_and_subscription_options | PDFOutput]] account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

The Sales Performance OS is a template designed for [[sales_performance_tracking_using_notion | sales performance tracking]]. It provides a comprehensive [[dashboard_presentation_and_setup | dashboard presentation and setup]] to give an overview of business sales activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, helping to track and summarize business finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The system is organized into several key components, providing different views of sales data.

## Sales Dashboard
The top section of the Sales Performance OS template features a primary sales dashboard with three main components, all divided by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>:

1.  **Salesperson** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>
    *   **Purpose:** Shows sales made by each salesperson for particular months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
    *   **Displayed Stats:**
        *   Sales achieved for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
        *   [[how_to_set_and_track_sales_targets | Targeted sales]] set for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
        *   Percentage of targeted sales received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
        *   Target status: "Target achieved" (if sales exceed target) or "Target not achieved" (if sales are underneath target) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

2.  **Sales Channel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
    *   **Purpose:** Represents the various sources from where sales have been made, also divided by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   **Examples:** Website, Instagram, YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Users can add custom categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   **Displayed Stats:** Shows sales achieved, targeted sales, percentage, and status, similar to the Salesperson view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

3.  **Sales Location** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
    *   **Purpose:** Represents where sales have been made to different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   **Displayed Stats:** Includes sales achieved, targeted sales, percentage, and status, consistent with the other components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Overview Components
On the left side of the dashboard, there are overview sections providing aggregated data:

1.  **Salesperson Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
    *   **Displayed Stats:**
        *   Total sales made by each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
        *   Sale units (how many units they have sold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
        *   Average sales (sale per unit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

2.  **Sales Channel Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
    *   **Displayed Stats:** Shows total sales, sale units, and average sales for each different sales channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

3.  **Sales Location Overview** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
    *   **Displayed Stats:** Displays total sales made to each location, average sales, and sale units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

These overviews help track and provide a comprehensive understanding of business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Sales Transactions

### Quick Actions and Settings
The system includes quick action buttons on the left:

*   **Sales Target:** Automatically assigns a target for a particular month for each salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This feature also applies to sales channels and locations, allowing users to set targeted sales for each channel and location at the start of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Add Transaction:** Used to enter new sales transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Customization and Data Management
The dashboard is highly customizable to user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, falling under the topic of [[customizing_and_filtering_sales_data | customizing and filtering sales data]].

*   **Currency:** The currency for the entire dashboard can be changed to a preferred currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Editing Details:** Users can instantly edit details like salesperson names by accessing the relevant dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Cover images can also be set for individual salespersons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Adding Months/Years:** New months (e.g., April 2024) and years can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Filtering:** Data can be filtered by specific year or month to view performance details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Combinations of filters (e.g., all months of a particular year) can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

This comprehensive structure allows for detailed tracking and management of sales performance across various dimensions.

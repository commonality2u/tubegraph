The quarterly summary feature provides an overview of financial activity across different quarters within the accounts receivable and payable tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## Location

This summary is located in the transaction section, appearing as the third segment after the receivable and payable transaction views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

## Information Provided

For each quarter, the summary reflects:
*   Total receivable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>
*   Total payable amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>
*   Net balance (calculated as total receivable less total payable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>

The total amount for all quarters combined is also displayed at the top of this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

### Example

As an example, for the third quarter:
*   Total receivables were $1150 (a summation of $150 and $1000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   Total payables were $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   The resulting net balance was $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

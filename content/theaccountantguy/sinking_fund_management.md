The personal finance tracker, developed in a Google Sheet, includes a dedicated tab for [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] analysis, offering a comprehensive overview of your financial goals and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This section allows users to track contributions, monitor remaining amounts, and estimate completion dates for various [[sinking_funds | sinking funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Sinking Fund Analysis Tab

This tab operates similarly to the [[monthly_budget_management_and_updates | monthly budget]] section, providing a structured way to manage specific savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Setting Up Sinking Funds

Users begin by specifying the [[types_of_sinking_funds_in_notion | sinking funds]] they wish to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. For each fund, you can define:
*   **Goal Amount** The target savings amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Monthly Contribution** The amount you intend to contribute each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Starting Amount** Any initial amount already saved for that specific fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

For example, a "home renovation" fund might have a goal of $5,000, a monthly contribution of $400, and a starting amount of $2,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Tracking Progress

Once these initial parameters are set, the tracker automatically calculates and displays several key metrics:
*   **Amount Saved So Far** Based on contributions entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Amount Left** How much more needs to be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Total Progress** The percentage of the goal achieved (total savings divided by the goal amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Estimated Completion Date** The expected date and number of months to reach the goal, assuming consistent monthly contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

This detailed analysis is available for every [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Recording Contributions

Similar to [[income_and_expense_management | expense]] tracking, users can record contributions to their [[sinking_funds | sinking funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This involves entering the date, selecting the appropriate fund from a dropdown, and inputting the contribution amount for the specific month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Overall Sinking Fund Overview

On the left side of the [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] analysis tab, a dynamic overview summarizes the total [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] goals, total savings made to date, and the total savings still outstanding across all funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

A quick graphical representation visually depicts:
*   **Green Bar** Total savings achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Black Bar** Total savings still needed for each specific [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

This visual aid provides an immediate understanding of progress towards each savings goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Dynamic Reporting

The "Reporting" section of the tracker offers a dynamic presentation that includes [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Users can select "sinking fund" from a dropdown and specify a month to view a quick summary of contributions for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This allows for quick analysis of financial standing at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

The [[sinking_funds | sinking fund]] analysis is fully integrated into this personal finance tracker, providing a comprehensive solution for managing and monitoring savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

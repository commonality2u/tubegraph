The Home Inventory Tracker is a simple template designed to help users keep track of all their home inventory in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This template is part of a broader category of [[home_inventory_tracking_with_notion | Notion inventory templates]] that can be tailored to specific needs.

## Template Overview and Features

The template provides a comprehensive overview of home inventory with several key sections:

### Financial Tracking
On the left side of the template, users can view financial summaries related to their inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This includes:
*   Total estimated purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   Total purchases that have been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   The difference between estimated and actual purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   The total percentage of purchases made compared to the estimated budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Inventory Categories
The right side of the template features three distinct sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The "Inventory Categories" section allows users to set up different classifications for their inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples provided include "Dairy & eggs", "Medicines", and "Fruits & veggies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Within each main category, subcategories are listed along with their estimated budgeted purchase amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Inventory Overview
The "Inventory Overview" section displays key metrics for all listed subcategory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, such as:
*   Total purchases made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Consumption units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Availability units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   The percentage of total units that have been consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Transaction Section
Finally, the "Transaction section" allows users to specify and track inventory transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This includes recording purchases, like a "cheese purchase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, and noting when items are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Users can add new entries and specify the number of items used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. All transaction entries automatically update the other sections of the template, helping users keep track of available inventory and required consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

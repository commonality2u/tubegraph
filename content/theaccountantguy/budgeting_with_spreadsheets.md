This article outlines how to use a personal finance tracker spreadsheet to manage income and expenses, leveraging different tabs for budgeting, transactions, and dashboard analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The spreadsheet includes a "Start Here" tab with instructions, a "Dashboard" tab for analysis, a "Transactions" tab for recording, and a "Budget" tab for setting financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Spreadsheet Structure

The personal finance tracker spreadsheet is organized into three main tabs:
*   **Dashboard Tab:** Provides an analytical overview of financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Transactions Tab:** Used for recording individual income and expense transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Budget Tab:** Where initial financial accounts and budgeted amounts are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Budget (Budget Tab)

The first step in [[Using Google Sheets for financial tracking | using Google Sheets for financial tracking]] involves populating the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Defining Accounts and Budgeted Amounts
*   **Feed Account Details:** Input details related to your income and expense accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Specify Monthly Amounts:** For each account, define the budgeted amount for each month, whether it's for budgeted expenses or income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Categorization:** Categorize each account as either "income" or "expense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Goal Amount Column:** The "goal amount" column automatically calculates the total based on the monthly figures entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This column is formula-driven, so when adding new line items, the formula needs to be dragged down to copy it to new rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Adding New Rows
To add more accounts, you can select the desired number of rows at the end of the tab and click "add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Recording Transactions (Transactions Tab)

After setting up the budget estimations in the Budget tab, the next step is to record actual transactions in the Transactions tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Columns in the Transactions tab include:
*   **Date:** The date of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Details:** A description of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Category:** Selects from the accounts defined in the Budget tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Income/Expense:** This column is formula-driven and automatically specifies whether the transaction is an income or an expense based on the category chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Similar to the Budget tab, this formula needs to be dragged down for new entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Amount:** The monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Analyzing Finances (Dashboard Tab)

The Dashboard tab provides a comprehensive analysis of all entered income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The displayed data can be controlled using filters for category, period, and type of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Dashboard Features
*   **Summary View:** Shows the total income, total expense amount, and net balance for the selected period and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Income Overview:** Details the different sources of income earned during the filtered period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Expenses Overview:** Provides a breakdown of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   [[monthly_budget_tracking | Monthly Budget Tracking]] **Overview:** A "monthly personal finance overview" displays income, expense, and net balance for each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Status Callout:** Indicates whether expenses have exceeded the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Filtering and Customization
The dashboard allows for flexible filtering to view specific data, such as total income for an entire year or details for individual income sources like salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This enables users to analyze their [[budget_vs_actual_expenses_tracking | budget vs actual expenses tracking]] and gain insights into their financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

A tax payment tracking template helps individuals and businesses monitor their tax payments, specifically focusing on quarterly obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This system allows for a quick glance at all tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Tax Payment Summary

At the top of the tracking template, a tax payment summary displays key financial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Accounts

The "Accounts" section is where you categorize all your revenue and expense sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Revenue Sources:** These are the activities or income streams that incur tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Examples include services and goods sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Expense Sources:** These are expenditures that allow you to claim [[tracking_tax_liabilities_and_input_taxes | input tax credit]] to offset tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An example is purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

You can add new revenue or expense sources using quick action buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> and fill in details using a pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The system automatically updates the count of revenue and expense sources as you add them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Financial Sections

The "Financials" section allows you to track your total revenue and expense amounts, along with the corresponding tax liabilities and [[tracking_tax_liabilities_and_input_taxes | input taxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For instance, services might have a total revenue of $2,000 with a tax payable of $200 (based on a 10% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Similarly, purchases might result in $10 of [[tracking_tax_liabilities_and_input_taxes | input taxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. All these figures update automatically as you enter details in the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Quarterly Taxes

This section displays the total tax payments due for each of the four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. For each quarter, you can view the taxes payable, [[tracking_tax_liabilities_and_input_taxes | input tax]], and the final tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For example, if all current transactions relate to Quarter 3, that quarter's figures for taxes payable, [[tracking_tax_liabilities_and_input_taxes | input tax]], and tax liability will be updated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This provides a summary view of tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Transaction Section

After setting up your revenue and expense accounts, you can input detailed transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Transactions are classified into two types: revenue and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Adding Revenue Transactions

1.  Click the "Add Revenue" button to create a new line item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The current date is automatically picked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
2.  Select the **period** (e.g., Quarter 3 for September transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Choose the relevant **account** (e.g., Goods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
4.  Enter the **amount** (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  Input the **tax rate** (e.g., 8%), which automatically calculates the tax payable (e.g., $80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
These details then update the quarterly taxes and overall tax liability summary at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Adding Expense Transactions

Adding an expense transaction follows a similar process:
1.  Click "Add Expense" to add a new entry for the current date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  Fill in details such as the quarter (e.g., Quarter 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
3.  Select the account (e.g., Purchases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount (e.g., $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
5.  Input the tax rate (e.g., 10%), which calculates the [[tracking_tax_liabilities_and_input_taxes | input credit]] (e.g., $50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
The total [[tracking_tax_liabilities_and_input_taxes | input credit]] and the final tax liability are then updated in the summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Profit & Loss Section

The template also includes a profit and loss section that displays:
*   Total revenue earned from all transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Total expenses booked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   The overall profit made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

This comprehensive approach helps in [[using_notion_for_tax_payment_tracking | tracking tax payments]] effectively and gaining a clear understanding of financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

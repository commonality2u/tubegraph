### Tracking Income and Expenses
To begin [[budgeting_and_tracking_in_notion | tracking income and expenses]] in Notion, navigate to the "Account section" under the "Get Started" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Here, you'll find income (e.g., salary, side hustle) and expenses (e.g., groceries, utility bills, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

#### Adding and Modifying Accounts
You can add new income or expenses by clicking the "new" button, or modify existing ones by clicking the "edit" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. When [[customizing_notion_for_personal_budget_management | setting up an expense]], you can classify it (e.g., bills, subscriptions) and set a payment frequency (e.g., monthly, annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. New accounts allow for naming, specifying an opening balance (optional for income/expense), classification, and payment frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

#### Entering Transactions
After setting up accounts, head to the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. There are five views: "All" (for all transaction types) and specific categories (Income, Expense, Asset, Liability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

To log an income transaction:
1.  Go to the "Income" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
2.  Click "new" and select the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Transactions are bifurcated by month and listed in descending order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
3.  Add a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
4.  Select the relevant income account (e.g., "Salary") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
5.  Choose the payment mode (e.g., bank, cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
6.  Select "Inflow" for income transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
7.  Specify the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

For expenses, the process is similar, but the transaction type will be "Outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

#### Summary View for Finances
The "Finances" view under "Summary" shows a comprehensive overview of income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. It displays total income and expenses, along with the percentage contribution of each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Figures automatically update when changes are made in the transaction section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Managing Debt
To [[using_notion_for_debt_tracking | track debt payments]], first go to the "Account section" and then the "Liabilities" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   Add new debt by clicking "new," inputting the name, opening balance, classifying it as "debt," and setting a payment frequency (e.g., monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Edit existing debt by clicking the pencil icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

#### Recording Debt Transactions
Enter debt payments under the "Liability" section of the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   Click "new," select the date, choose the debt account (e.g., "Home Loan"), payment mode (e.g., bank), and transaction type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   For loan repayments, use "Outflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. For obtaining a new loan, use "Inflow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   Specify the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This updates the total loan amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

#### Debt Summary
The "Debt" view under "Summary" shows "Upcoming Payments" (due in the future) and "Past Payments" (missed or already paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This helps identify overdue payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Each debt entry displays the total loan amount (opening balance + additional loans), total repayment percentage, and amount not yet paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The display layout can be customized to list, gallery, or board views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

### Budgeting
[[Using Notion for budgeting]] for personal finances involves tracking income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. After inputting all transactions, navigate to the "Budget" section under the "Summary" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. This section outlines incurred expenses and their percentage against the total budgeted amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Budget amounts can be adjusted by clicking on the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Estimated income is also tracked against actual earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. If budget properties are not visible, they can be found by searching for "budgeted amount" in the "31 more properties" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

### Tracking Savings
To [[setting_and_tracking_budget_goals_with_notion | set up and track savings funds]], go to the "Account section" under "Get Started" and then the "Asset" part, as savings are considered assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   Create a new savings fund (e.g., "Car Fund") by clicking "new," classify it under "Savings," and optionally set a goal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
*   The savings section reflects the goal amount, total amount saved, and savings percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   Icons can be added to savings funds for visual identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

#### Adding Savings Transactions
Add savings transactions under the "Asset" section of the "Transactions" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
*   Create a new transaction, provide a description (e.g., "Car Fund Savings"), select the savings account, choose the payment mode (e.g., bank), and set the transaction type as "Outflow" since money is moving from your main account to the savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   Enter the amount, which will then update the savings section with the amount saved and the percentage towards the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

### Managing Bills and Subscriptions
For [[using_notion_for_expense_management | expense management]], bills and subscriptions are set up similarly to other expenses.

#### Bills
In the "Account section," under "Expenses," classify relevant accounts as "Bills" and set their payment frequency (e.g., monthly for Wi-Fi bills) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. Bill payments are entered in the "Expense" part of "Transactions" as "Outflow" transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. The "Bills" section under "Summary" displays "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments," showing due dates and helping track missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

#### Subscriptions
Similar to bills, subscriptions are set up in the "Account section" under "Expenses," classified as "Subscription," and assigned a payment frequency (e.g., annually for Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. Subscription payments are added as "Outflow" transactions in the "Expenses" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. The "Subscription" view in "Summary" shows "Upcoming Payments" and "Past Payments," along with the subscription status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

### Net Worth Tracking
Net worth is calculated as assets minus liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Goal:** Set a net worth target for the financial year in the "Net Worth Goal" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Summary:** The "Net Worth" section under "Summary" shows the current net worth (assets less liabilities after all transactions), the difference from the goal, and the percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. It also displays the total growth, which is the closing net worth less the opening net worth, derived from the opening balances specified in the "Account section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

### Features for Couples
For couples, the Notion dashboard is applicable for [[setting_up_notion_for_personal_finance_tracking | tracking finances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. In the "Account section," individuals can split categories of accounts (income, expenses, assets, liabilities) by adding "by him" or "by her" to account names, allowing for individual tracking within the shared system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

### Quick Transaction View
To view transactions related to a specific account (e.g., "Salary") without navigating through all transactions, click on the account name in the "Finances in Summary" view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. A "View Transactions" option will appear at the bottom, which, when clicked, will populate only the transactions associated with that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.

### Template Compatibility and Currency
*   The Notion template is available on all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, supporting iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.
*   Notion is a free tool for basic use; no extra payment is needed beyond the template's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.
*   The template supports multiple currencies. To change the currency, locate any field with a dollar sign (e.g., in "Transactions" or "Net Worth" views), click on it, select "Edit Property," go to "Number Format," and choose the desired currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. This change needs to be applied to all relevant views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

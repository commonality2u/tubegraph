[[using_notion_for_business_management | Notion]] can be used to track product orders for your [[using_notion_for_business_management | business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A simple template helps keep track of all products customers are ordering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Template Overview

The template includes a database designed to organize product and customer information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Database Details
The database captures essential information for each order:
*   **Product Details:** Such as the product name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Customer Information:** Including the customer's name, billing address, phone number, and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Payment Sources:** Specifies how the customer intends to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Gift Item Indicator:** Notes whether the product is intended as a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Order Amount:** The total value for the particular order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Order Summary
At the top of the template, an order summary provides key metrics:
*   Total order value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

The template also details payment sources, showing how many customers pay through different methods like debit card, PayPal, credit card, and other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Each payment source reflects the number of customers and their respective percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

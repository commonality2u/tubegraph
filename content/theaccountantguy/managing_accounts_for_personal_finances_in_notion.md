Sanat Biswal, also known as "The Accountant Guy," provides Notion templates to help individuals, freelancers, and small business owners manage their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>. This guide focuses on using a specific [[tracking_assets_and_liabilities_in_Notion | Net Worth Tracker]] developed in Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">00:00:26</a>.

## Net Worth Tracker Overview

The Net Worth Tracker is organized into three main sections to help calculate net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">00:00:37</a>:
1.  **Get Started Section** where a net worth goal is specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">00:00:45</a>.
2.  **Account Section** where different accounts (expenses, income, assets, and liabilities) are classified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">00:00:51</a>.
3.  **Summary Section** providing an overview of finances and the net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">00:01:04</a>. This section displays accounts with their closing balances and proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">00:01:11</a>.
    *   A dedicated Net Worth sub-section shows the net worth goal, total net worth calculation, the difference between the two, total growth, and percentage of the goal achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">00:01:19</a>.
4.  **Transactions View** where income, expenses, assets, and liabilities details are recorded to contribute to the net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">00:01:38</a>.

## Setting Up Accounts

To begin [[setting_up_notion_for_personal_finance_tracking | tracking personal finances]], accounts must be set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">00:01:49</a>.

### Set Net Worth Goal
In the "Get Started" section, under the "Net Worth goal" view, users can specify their desired net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">00:01:57</a>. For example, a goal can be set at $14,000, and changing this value automatically updates the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">00:02:03</a>.

### Add New Accounts
In the "Account" section, new accounts can be added under various categories such as Income, Expenses, Assets, or Liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">00:02:23</a>. To add a new account, click the "New" button displayed underneath each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">00:02:33</a>.

When adding an account, various details can be filled in:
*   **Name:** For example, "Interest Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">00:02:48</a>.
*   **Opening Balance:** This value is used for assets and liabilities at the start of the financial year but is left blank for income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">00:02:57</a>.
*   **Classification (Tag):** Accounts can be categorized, similar to "Groceries" under "Bills" or "Netflix" under "Subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">00:03:11</a>. Users can add custom categories like "Other Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">00:03:44</a>.

*   **Opening Units:** Used specifically for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">00:04:28</a>. For example, "Bitcoin" as an investment might have an opening balance of $100 and 10 opening units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">00:05:24</a>.
*   **Asset Class:** For investments, this field should be set to "Investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">00:04:39</a>. For other accounts, it can be left blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">00:05:51</a>.

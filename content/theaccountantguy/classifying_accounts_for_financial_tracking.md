The Accountant Guy, Sanat Biswal, offers Notion templates designed to help individuals, freelancers, and small business owners manage their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. One such template is a Net Worth Tracker, which facilitates tracking and understanding one's financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Net Worth Tracker Overview

The Net Worth Tracker is structured into three main sections to help calculate net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:
1.  **Get Started Section**: Used for specifying a net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  **Account Section**: Allows users to specify all accounts for their personal finances, categorized into income, expenses, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  **Summary Section**: Provides an overview of finances, displaying closing balances and proportions of each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This section also includes the net worth calculation, showing the goal, total net worth, difference, growth, and percentage towards the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
4.  **Transactions View**: Where users input details related to income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, which then contributes to the net worth calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Setting Up and Classifying Accounts

To begin, users set a net worth goal in the "Get Started" section, which automatically updates the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The core of [[classifying_and_tracking_income_expenses_assets_and_liabilities | financial tracking]] within this template lies in the "Account Section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Here, users can define and categorize various financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Adding New Accounts
New accounts can be added under their respective categories (income, expense, asset, liability) by clicking the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

When adding an account, users can specify:
*   **Account Name**: E.g., "Interest Income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Opening Balance**:
    *   Income and Expense accounts typically do not have an opening balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   [[Debt and liability tracking | Assets]] and [[Debt and liability tracking | Liabilities]] can have an opening balance, representing the value at the start of the financial year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Classification (Tags)**: Accounts can be assigned tags for categorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Examples include "Groceries" under "Bills," "Netflix" under "Subscription," or specific classifications for savings or debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Users can [[customizing_categories_for_expense_tracking | add their own custom categories]] or use existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Payment Frequency**: For income or recurring expenses, users can set how frequently a payment is expected (e.g., monthly for salary, quarterly for interest income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Custom frequencies can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Opening Units (for Investments)**: For investment assets (like Bitcoin), an "opening units" field allows tracking the initial number of units held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Asset Class (for Investments)**: Investments can be specifically classified under the "Investments" asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Other account types can leave this field blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Editing Existing Accounts
Existing accounts can be modified by clicking the pencil icon next to them, opening an edit window to change values or descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Transactions and Financial Flow

The "Transactions" section is where all financial activities are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. It has views for income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, organized by month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

When entering a transaction:
*   Users select the date, add a description (e.g., "Salary Income"), and specify the category (which is automatically set by the view chosen, like "income") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   The transaction is linked to a specific account created in the "Account Section" (e.g., "Salary account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Payment Mode**: Indicates how money is received or paid (e.g., "Bank Account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Transaction Type**: Classified as either "inflow" (money coming into the account, typical for income or obtaining a loan) or "outflow" (money leaving the account, typical for expenses or loan repayments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Amount**: The monetary value of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Document**: Users can attach receipts or bills related to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Financial Assessment

After inputting accounts and transactions, the "Summary" section computes the net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The "Finances" view provides a current snapshot of all expenses, income, assets, and liabilities, showing their amounts and proportion to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

The "Net Worth" view calculates:
*   **Net Worth Goal**: The target value set by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Total Net Worth**: The difference between total assets and total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Difference**: The gap between the net worth goal and the current total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Total Growth**: The change from the opening net worth (calculated from opening balances of assets and liabilities) to the closing net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Percentage to Net Worth Goal**: How much of the set goal has been accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

These figures update automatically as transactions are added, providing a dynamic assessment of financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This allows for [[tracking_personal_finances_in_notion | comprehensive personal finance tracking]] and [[managing_funds_and_balance_tracking | balance tracking]].

## Customization and Additional Features

The Notion template offers flexibility:
*   **Currency Change**: Users can change the currency from dollars to over 30 other currencies supported by Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **Dashboard View Customization**: The layout of the dashboard can be changed (e.g., from Board view to Gallery view) and grouped by categories for a different visual presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Device Compatibility**: The template supports various devices and operating systems, including iOS and Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

Beyond the Net Worth Tracker, a more comprehensive Notion template for personal finances includes features like debt payments, budgeting, savings tracker, bills, subscriptions, and investment tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This full template can be upgraded from the existing Net Worth Tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

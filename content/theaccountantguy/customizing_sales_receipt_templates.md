## Notion Sales Receipt Tracker Database

The sales receipts tracker features a database designed to help track sales information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Key fields include:
*   **Receipt Number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Receipt Date** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Payment Method**: Offers various options for clearing payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Business Name and Address** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   **Customer Details**: A relational property linked to another database containing client information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Description**: Details what is being sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Quantity of Sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   **Unit Price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

Multiple descriptions, quantities, and unit prices can be added for a single sale across different rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The subtotal column automatically sums up the total amount for individual items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, and the total amount is computed after applying the tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. A "notes" column is available for any related information regarding payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Sales Receipt Summary and Client Summary

The template includes a sales receipt summary at the top, displaying the total sales made and units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. If additional columns for descriptions and quantities are added, users must update the formulas for the subtotal and total amount calculations to ensure accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

A "quantity sold" column shows the units sold per item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The average sales value is calculated by dividing total sales by units sold, providing key business insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

A client summary section details total sales, total quantity of sales, and average sales price for each client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
